<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 16th AIPO Conference, Singapore, and bilateral visit to Thailand, September 1995. It was my honour to head the delegation to the 16th general assembly of AIPO, which was held in Singapore just on 12 months ago. From the outset, I indicate to the House that the delegation acknowledges the delay in placing this report before the parliament. There were a number of reasons for this. One was the interruption in the intervening period due to the election. This delay does not in any way indicate that the Australian delegation did not believe that its involvement at AIPO was important and that the bilateral visit to Thailand was important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I place on record my thanks to the other members of the delegation. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) was the deputy leader of the delegation. It has been my pleasure to head two delegations where he has been the deputy. I appreciate his cooperation on both occasions in helping me to perform my role. Senator John Watson was also part of the delegation. Two former members of this House, Mr Les Scott and Mr Neville Newell, were also members of the delegation. The report of the delegation is the work of the member for Corangamite, Senator Watson and me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also place on record my thanks to the secretary of the delegation, Jane Vincent. The delegation members and Jane gave me valuable support in my role as leader and all made worthwhile contributions to the work of the delegation. The delegation was accompanied by my wife, Mrs McArthur and Mrs Newell who also made contributions to the work of the delegation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been traditional that parliamentary delegations to AIPO conferences take the opportunity to make bilateral visits to member states of ASEAN. I understand that the outgoing delegation to the 17th conference of AIPO, which leaves next week, will not have that opportunity. That is regrettable and unfortunate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our bilateral visit was to the Kingdom of Thailand. Thailand is a very interesting nation and a longstanding partner with Australia in a number of endeavours. As this delegation's visit took place during Australia Remembers, the emphasis on Australia's cooperation and involvement with Thailand in military matters was of course most important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the suggestion of Senator Watson, we have an opening dedication in our report which is a quote from a plaque at Hellfire Pass. The dedication reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When you go home tell them of us and say we gave our tomorrow for your today.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that this message was pinned along the railway by one of those who worked on it. I think it encapsulates the spirit and continuing connection that Australia has as a result of the efforts of those who served in Thailand and were prisoners of war and were forced to work alongside the many thousands of other prisoners of war and the many thousands of natives that were captured and forced to work on the railway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When in Thailand we were able to visit Bangkok and a number of the provinces. On our visits to the provinces we saw a number of aid projects that Australia has been involved with. They are quite diverse aid projects. One we visited was the Mae Moh lignite mine where Australia's technological assistance has been of great value. Another was the northern Thailand AIDS project where, in a different manner, Australia's involvement has been appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though one project was a community services, medical model and the other was an industry technology model, Australia's involvement included assisting the Thai authorities to work with the local people. The local people were empowered to be involved in both projects. The local people were given assistance in ensuring that anything they were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doing conformed to local custom, was culturally sensitive and had the full support of the communities that they involved. I think this type of philosophy of Australia's aid involvement is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The delegation was impressed at the projects we saw and impressed by the work that people were doing. We were impressed that Australia's involvement in most projects was acknowledged and seen to be quite valuable. Also we had the opportunity to go to the Burma&hyphen;Thai border and visit one of the displaced persons camps. Australia's involvement is through funding through the Burma Border Consortium and also some funding to Medecins Sans Frontieres which works within the camps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was an interesting experience for the delegation because, yet again, it exposed a parliamentary delegation to the efforts that are made by countries that have situations on their border leading to either refugees or displaced persons coming across and having to be dealt with. The honourable member for Corangamite and I on a previous delegation on the Bangladeshi&hyphen;Burma border visited a refugee camp, and on this delegation found ourselves on the other side of Burma in Thailand, again visiting a displaced persons camp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would hope that debates such as we saw in this place in private members business on the Burmese question indicate that Australia has a longstanding interest in seeing that the troubles of Burma are settled so that those people who have fled can feel comfortable enough to return. It is a thing that we must emphasise: the displaced people that we spoke to in the camps have a great desire to be able to return to Burma. They do not see resettlement within Thailand as the host nation as the outcome that they would wish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We laud the work of those aid workers working with the refugees in very trying conditions. We congratulate the provincial and government authorities of Thailand for the work they are doing in the camps. We understand that there are, of course, the competing interests of trying to develop a good relationship with a neighbouring country alongside <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3930"> the humanitarian desire to assist the people in the camps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the report we go into more detail and indicate what we think of the work that is going on in the camps. We hope that, not only in these camps along the Burmese&hyphen;Thai border but in other camps, we see continuing education, going beyond mid&hyphen;secondary level to some form of post&hyphen;secondary, and the development of skills that might be of value in an economic sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Bangkok we took the opportunity to speak to a number of people who have trade interests with Australia. Thailand, of course, is a great trading opportunity that I am sure will continue to be further developed. The delegation expresses our thanks to those DFAT officers who assisted us in Bangkok, especially Antoinette Merrillees who accompanied the delegation throughout our visit. A one&hyphen;week visit to a country is not a very long visit. It only gives the delegation an opportunity to gain a very good impression of what is happening but it is important that we have that exposure and that we build those relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work of those from the National Assembly of Thailand who hosted us was exceptional. They put in a great deal of effort to ensure that a very interesting and worthwhile program was put in place for us. There were logistic difficulties because of the rain, which meant that we had to use road transport at one stage. But that also had a hidden benefit because it exposed us to a wider degree of the provincial countryside of Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The delegation then went to Singapore for the AIPO conference. Australia has been an observer country at AIPO conferences over a very long time. Australia and eight other countries were given observer status. AIPO appreciates these delegations. The AIPO conference is an excellent opportunity for us as parliamentarians to develop contacts and friendships with very important players in the parliaments of ASEAN nations, and the type of parliamentary contact that is achieved at AIPO conferences cannot be overestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report from the delegation indicates our agreement that there is some benefit in having continuing members of our delegation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the conference because that is seen as an advantage. Mr Newell had attended a previous conference and that was of assistance. I think that that is something this parliament might look at. Another suggestion contained in the report is that the Presiding Officers might look at the possibility of inviting an AIPO delegation to Australia. This is something that AIPO saw as being beneficial. I think it would enable a wider range of Australian parliamentarians to get a feel for how important to the parliaments of the ASEAN countries AIPO is seen to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AIPO is made up of a diverse group of nations but, in a regional sense, they work cooperatively. They acknowledge that Australia is a partner, not only because of our relationship in the East Asia hemisphere but through the strong trading and historical links that we have had with each of the countries. So the continuing contact that an AIPO conference gives us is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also we took the opportunity to have a number of bilateral visits whilst in Singapore. Singapore is one of the miracles of the region. There is much we can learn but we have to put that in a cultural context. Singapore is a quite different nation from Australia but its ability to achieve what it has achieved has to be acknowledged and admired. In Singapore we had great assistance from the High Commission and we acknowledge Mr Kevin Magee, who accompanied the delegation and gave valuable advice and assistance while we were at the conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, these types of visit are important&mdash;not only because they expose us as Australian parliamentarians to, in this case, important nations of our region but also because they are an indication of the importance that Australia places on the strong ties and contacts it has in the region, many of which have a great depth in history and many of which are developing even more strongly in modern times as our interdependence as regional neighbours becomes even more clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of those that we met, especially in Thailand, have strong feelings for Australia because they were able to come here and be educated in not too distant times under the Colombo Plan. They have great connections <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3931"> with Australia through that and they see that we are, as the term is often used, an honest broker&mdash;somebody that they are able to sit  down and talk straight with. They know that we will not be overbearing in the way that we suggest that they go about their business and when we have suggestions and criticisms they will be taken on board. For instance, in my contribution and in the dialogue session we had at AIPO, we were able to indicate our disquiet at the time of the nuclear testing that was occurring in the Pacific. This was taken on board and the delegations of the ASEAN parliaments that were at AIPO gave us their full support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again I thank the members of the delegation; I thank the secretary, Jane Vincent; and I thank those people from the Parliamentary Library and from DFAT who gave us briefings before we went, because those briefings were very valuable to the work of the delegation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I support the remarks of the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), the leader of the delegation to the 16th ASEAN Inter&hyphen;parliamentary Organisation in Singapore and the bilateral visit to Thailand. I reciprocate the remarks made by the leader of the delegation and say that in representing this parliament he performed in an exemplary manner. I have had the honour of travelling with him in one other delegation, and that experience clearly demonstrates that members on both sides of this parliament can represent the parliament and Australia in other countries, disregarding their particular domestic political points of view, and put the Australian context to other nations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He should be because of his great performance overseas. The honourable member has led this delegation and presented Australia's case very well. I also thank Jane Vincent, the secretary of the delegation, for her cooperation and assistance during the visit. I note, however, that the leader's football team, Fitzroy, is no longer in existence, and I am sure that is a major setback to him personally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our visit to Thailand clearly demonstrated the closeness of the two nations. Thailand has maintained some educational links with Australia through its leaders, and it came through in discussions with parliamentarians and business leaders that they regarded Australia as a very close ally in terms of friendship, economic cooperation and those cultural links that go back a long way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 59 million people who constitute that nation are now part of an emerging Asian tiger. It is a dynamic economy. Some of the infrastructure leaves a bit to be desired but roads and communications have made rapid strides in the last 15 years. The infrastructure at Bangkok really gives an indication of what can go wrong in an Asian city where the planners lack foresight. There is an accumulation of problems of roads, bridges and the sheer ability of that city to operate in a modern age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The emerging middle class gives a certain dynamic to Thailand's economy and the cultural exchange of the various ethnic backgrounds also gives it a certain dynamic quality that we do not always observe in other Asian nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leader mentioned the visit to the lignite mine. That was interesting in terms of the Australian contribution to the environmental control, the re&hyphen;afforestation and the wetlands operation to control the high rainfall that was apparent in that area. I compliment that Australian contribution in technology, which could be transferred to other parts of the world and also used here in Australia to look after a mine in operation and as it completes its job. It is a very big open&hyphen;cut mine, some 400 metres deep, and a very impressive operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leader also mentioned the AIDS program. There was an interesting observation about the Australian contribution to an educational program for young females who, because of poverty, entered the sex industry in the northern part of Thailand. It would seem from our observations that the AIDS epidemic was rampant in northern Thailand. It is of great concern to the local population and to those Australians who are close to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3932"> program that this epidemic is of such proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The displaced persons camp having 87,000 people&mdash;as the leader mentioned, we did see one in Bangladesh on a previous delegation&mdash;brings home very clearly the sorts of problems that displaced persons, refugees, have in Asia. We also see it in the recent conflict in Iran with the Kurds. The stateless position of these refugees, the very low standards of living, the sheer state of the buildings and the health of these refugees just makes us realise how well off we are here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I think the highlight from my point of view was the visit to the Thai-Burma railway, which many members of this House might have some connection with through their families. Some 2,700 Australians died on that Burma railway, which was constructed between 1942 and 1943. We visited Hellfire Pass and looked at the memorial that was laid by Weary Dunlop in 1987. As you know, Weary Dunlop died in 1993, and his ashes were spread at this particular location. It was a very moving experience, for those of us who had an interest in that matter, to actually see the amount of human suffering that would have occurred at that Hellfire Pass and the sheer magnitude of the task of moving those rocks almost totally by human endeavour. We state in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enormity of the work carried out by the prisoners of war to excavate the cutting, remove the soil and rocks and build the bridges under extreme and cruel conditions is really brought home when one walks through Hellfire Pass. It was a special and memorable experience for the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA>As it was during the Australia Remembers program, it was a very enlightening experience for those of us who did not suffer the rigours of war to feel very closely the deprivation and rigours of those prisoners of war who worked in tropical conditions under very difficult conditions imposed by the Japanese; yet some of them managed to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Moving to the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation Conference, again I would like to quote the leader's remarks to that conference which I think encapsulate the attitude of the delegation:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament-to-parliament and people-to-people contacts such as that provided by this meeting play a critical role in providing a strong foundation for the future prosperity and stability of the Asia Pacific region in which ASEAN countries and Australia are such close neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA>I would leave it at that. We were not a member of the conference but we had observer status. On that basis, we were able to contribute at a personal level. The delegation played an important role. Again, this year, Australia will be represented with a similar status, building up those friendships and long-term contacts both on behalf of this parliament and of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then visited Singapore. That is a very interesting city&hyphen;state of three million people. It is interesting to members of parliament in terms of both their political philosophy and their economic development. I also acknowledge the assistance of the Australian embassy and its officer Kevin Magee in helping the delegation during our visit to Singapore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talked to the trade union movement in Singapore. They have 23 per cent of the work force in membership and face similar problems to the trade union movement here in Australia. The central provident fund provided an interesting lesson to Australia in building up a compulsory superannuation health scheme where 20 per cent is contributed by employees and 20 per cent by employers, making a total contribution of 40 per cent; so, on that basis, there are massive funds being built up to look after older persons in Singapore. The fund helps with health, retirement and housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The philosophy of that fund, which a number of people around the world have had a look at, was interesting. The chairman of the fund board made the following comments about the fund which I thought were interesting: the fund is self&hyphen;funding, unlike superannuation in Australia; the savings scheme has encouraged people to work; the fund encourages people to upgrade their skills so they can increase their salary; and it encourages the family, and strengthens the intra-family links and pooling of family resources&mdash;unlike the attitudes here in Australia which tend to encourage a dependence on the government. The fund's economic benefits include the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3933"> provision of funds for the country's development. It makes a major saving contribution to Singapore, and the savings are capitalised. Some of us were particularly interested to observe that fund and the way it operated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we looked at the racing industry in Singapore, which provided some interest to those of us who have had an association with the racing industry. There are strong connections to the Australian racing industry because our bloodstock is exported to Singapore. Some 30,000 people attend their main race meetings. There is wide coverage of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also visited Changi war museum. Again, we were impressed by the prison.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr ACTING SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VH4">Mr McARTHUR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Changi prison and the museum there again brought home to us the horrific pressures and endurance that the prisoners of war had during that Changi period. Again, we were most impressed that those persons who perished in Changi and those who survived are remembered by much of the memorabilia in the Changi war museum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, can I say that Singapore is an example to the delegation of three million people who have no resources but who have great energy, a sense of policy direction and a correct policy that has improved their standard of living in an unbelievable manner. In conclusion, I think the members of the delegation represented both this House and the Senate very well in putting the Australian point of view. It was a happy delegation, and I am delighted to have been part of that representation on behalf of Australia and this parliament.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This higher education funding legislation was introduced before the government's announcements in regard to higher education funding arising from the budget deliberations so the content of it is not such that we would have any objections to it. As well as containing a number of technical amendments that clear up a number of anomalies&mdash;and, obviously, we have no objection to that&mdash;it is also providing some additional funding to universities in the form of supplementation for price adjustments and so forth. The financial impact of this bill is positive. It provides increases of $48 million in 1996, $44.9 million in 1997 and $35.3 million in 1998 on the currently legislated amounts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly the bill itself is not contentious. I was a little bit surprised that, in the light of the budget decisions, the government did not choose to withdraw this bill and bring in a revised piece of legislation with more relevant numbers for the out years of the triennium in it. I had a discussion with the head of the higher education division on Monday of this week. The general thinking was that there was a reluctance to give up the slot in the legislative program because a lot of the non-contentious technical amendments were ones that they were keen to see adopted, so the position there is understandable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, we are going to see further legislation some time down the track which will reflect the impact of the government's funding decisions on the current higher education triennium&mdash;1996, 1997 and 1998. Those changes will be considerably less benign than those we see contained in this bill. In a sense, the numbers in the bill in this context are not all that critical anyway, given the way that the Higher Education Funding Act is framed. The amounts specified in the bill for operating grant purposes are specified as maxima. The minister has a power to determine an amount to be paid up to those maxima and that can be done by regulation, which is a disallowable instrument. So in that sense the maximum specified in the legislation is not as critical as it might be in other contexts. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3934">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, this legislation provides us with an opportunity to comment on the broader issues of higher education funding and to talk in particular about the budget measures. Our position on these matters is well known. Most of the measures that relate to higher education were announced in a separate statement prior to the budget. I guess that reflected the response of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to the fact that there was clearly a very high level of concern in the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the celebrated dinner with the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, there was a reaction which started out as sheer perplexity and developed into consternation and rage from the sector. We had a whole series of statements from just about every stakeholder in the higher education sector&mdash;whether it be institutional managers, vice-chancellors, students or organisations representing academic and general staff&mdash;condemning in the most severe terms the thrust of the government's decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the minister believed that releasing that information early would defuse it before the major budget measures were announced. In that respect I think she made a miscalculation. The way things were presented in the higher education statement was clearly designed to understate the impact of these changes on institutions. The material was presented with comparisons made between 1997 and 1998 with 1996 amounts. She was saying that there was a slight increase in 1997 over 1996 and that in 1997 and 1998 there were small declines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a highly misleading way of presenting things because the relevant comparison is not that; it is the amounts that the government is proposing for 1997 and 1998 and the other out years compared with the sums that the former government had already legislated for through the higher education funding legislation and had set out in the triennium for 1996 to 1998. When you make that sort of comparison, the picture is very different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at operating grants over the four years of the forward estimates, you are looking at a reduction of some $624 million over <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what the former government had proposed and had built into the forward estimates. There is also a major cut in the so-called discretionary funds, in fact the abolition of those funds, and that amounts to some $214 million over the four years of the forward estimates. In addition to that, as the vice-chancellors have pointed out repeatedly, you also have to take into account the decision to provide no supplementation for salary increases in the universities. The cost of that is the best part of $300 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you combine those various elements, you come up with a very severe cut indeed. The Vice-Chancellors Committee has estimated that, when you combine those three elements, you are looking at an effective cut of around 10 per cent by the fourth year. The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney, Professor Gavin Brown, who I think is a mathematician by training, estimated that by the year 2000 the effect of all the changes I have described would be a 15 per cent cut for his institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this is not exactly what Senator Vanstone described as a `nick'. This is a set of decisions that has very serious implications for our universities, for our higher education system and for all those who participate in that sector. Senator Vanstone described this as a `nick'. All I can say is, if that is a nick, I hope I am not around when she gets onto the serious stuff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would make at the outset is that these decisions in respect of higher education amount to a massive breach of promise by the coalition. The coalition's pre-election commitment was to at least maintain university grants for operating purposes and for research purposes. That commitment has obviously been massively and undeniably breached. Senator Vanstone has tried to characterise it by saying that it is something like a 95 per cent keep because the universities are still getting 95 per cent of what they were going to get before. As I said, that is an overly optimistic presentation of the impact of these government changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3935"> What an extraordinary proposition. Is she saying that the universities should be extremely grateful that she did not abolish the operat ing grant altogether? That a very major cut can be characterised as a 90 per cent keep simply because the whole funding basis for a major area of activity supported by government is not cut in half or abolished altogether is an absolutely extraordinary way of looking at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that in the higher education area we have seen a massive breach of promise by the coalition in the cuts to operating grants, the changes to HECS&mdash;contrary to what the minister says&mdash;and the changes to Austudy. I remind the House that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), before the election, stated on a number of occasions when challenged that, if it came down to a choice between keeping the coalition's promises on the one hand and slowing the achievement of the government's fiscal objectives on the other, maintaining the promises would be the priority. This was said in the context of a lot of speculation about what the underlying budgetary position would be. The answers given by the coalition when challenged on that were absolutely unequivocal. We are seeing a massive breach of promise here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suggestions or statements are being made to universities by the minister, and also through the department, to the effect that if the opposition parties manage to block the HECS changes in the budget then universities can expect another chunk to be taken out of their operating grants. I consider this a piece of outrageous political thuggery. The minister is in effect saying that if the opposition parties fail to legislatively endorse the coalition's breach of promise on HECS then that will compound the extent of the government's breach of promise in respect of operating grants: already a very major breach of promise will be made worse by further cuts if the opposition parties fail to legislatively endorse the coalition's breach of promise on HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This is just an outrageous tactic. I suppose the minister might derive some satisfaction from the fact that some vice-chancellors have clearly become concerned about that and some are urging the opposition parties to actually pass the HECS legislation. But I believe that those vice-chancellors are re sponding to this piece of political thuggery. I think it is an outrage. From the point of view of the opposition parties, we are certainly not going to be deterred from what we regard as a highly principled stance on HECS and other matters as a result of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I could talk a bit more about the funding cuts&mdash;as I said, the minister has characterised them as a `nick'&mdash;the operating grants, which are being cut by $624 million over four years, are the basic element in university funding. The grants are a lump sum provided to the universities and, subject to conforming to a broad academic profile of teaching and research, they have a high degree of discretion as to how they utilise those funds. They constitute a very high proportion of the totality of funds provided to institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to bear that in mind when the coalition talks about providing what it describes as massive increases in funding for research, infrastructure, postgraduate awards, collaborative research grants and so forth. If you aggregate all those elements and do the sum over four years, you are looking at an increase in those areas of something like $130 million versus the $624 million cut in university operating grants alone. The fact is that universities use their operating grants to support all their activities, including teaching and research activities. Some universities fund postgraduate awards out of their general funding. Some universities support other activities out of their general operating grant, including community based activities and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is simply absurd and meaningless to hive off a set of decisions to increase aspects of research funding specifically and say that that represents a massive increase when the general pool of funds available for universities, which they can use for capital purposes, for research infrastructure purposes, for teaching purposes to support their research activities in a broad sense, is being massively cut and then say that they are doing a big favour for the research side at least by providing these additional funds in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that a large chunk of the cuts in discretionary funds, which I said amount to around $214 million over four <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3936"> years, in effect became funds available for universities to use in ways they saw fit. They were allocated through the quality assurance mechanism, but once that allocation had been made those additional funds effectively became part of the total resources available to universities. So I repudiate the claim that there is anything positive for universities in the set of decisions that this government has taken. You have to look at the aggregate funding available to universities for all of their activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the impact of this going to be? It is a bit unclear at this stage. All the universities have been written to by the department informing them of the change in their operating grant compared with what had been legislated for by the previous government. That has also been translated into a reduction in their effective full-time student load. In all cases, this represents a significant reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) has been trying to claim that she has had a big win for the University of Western Sydney because the figures continue to show growth in 1997 and 1998 over 1996. That is true, but that is simply a consequence of the previous government having targeted a substantial amount of growth to that institution. The same is true of a number of institutions in Queensland which continue, even after the adjustments, to show growth in 1997 and 1998 over 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the point is that the extent of that growth has been significantly cut. In the case of the University of Western Sydney&mdash;I am referring to figures provided to me by the department&mdash;its current allocation in effective full&hyphen;time student units for 1997 is 18,045; under the revised allocation it falls to 17,850. For 1998, the current figure of 18,395 falls, under the revisions flowing from the cuts announced by the government, to 17,645. So when you make the relevant comparison&mdash;that is, the effectively funded student places legislated for by the previous government compared with what the current government is providing&mdash;in all cases you have an unambiguous reduction in opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unclear exactly how these cuts will impact. The universities have been told to try <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to absorb the cuts as far as possible through reductions in government funded postgraduate coursework places, with education and nursing qualifications, which are the initial entry qualifications to get into those professions, excluded. Clearly, the postgraduate coursework area will bear a disproportionate burden of the adjustment process. That will create some very severe problems for institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Institutions vary in their postgraduate profile. Some currently do not have a sufficient total load of postgraduate coursework places to absorb cuts of the magnitude that have been talked about here, even if they discarded all their non&hyphen;nursing and non&hyphen;education postgraduate coursework places. It will mean very major distortions in the academic profiles of some institutions and the effective drying up of postgraduate coursework places in some areas of study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of vice&hyphen;chancellors have expressed to me their serious concerns about that change to their academic profiles. There is no doubt that undergraduate intakes will have to bear a significant chunk of the burden of the adjustment. That might be in the form of either reduced undergraduate intakes or it might be in the form of reduced funding per student. Either the number of opportunities will be diminished or the quality of those opportunities will be diminished as a result of reduced funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite dishonest for coalition members around the country, in areas where universities continue to have growth funding in 1997 and 1998, to claim that they have had some sort of a win as a result of this process. They might have growth funding but it has been diminished significantly in comparison with what the previous government was providing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn now to cuts in discretionary funds. I acknowledge that this is something that the coalition said before the election that they would do, so I do not claim breach of promise in this area. But I still say that the impact of getting rid of the so&hyphen;called discretionary funds is a significant negative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The so&hyphen;called discretionary funds are really a consolidation of what were a number of separate funds, the main ones being the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3937"> quality assurance money&mdash;which was introduced when I was minister, or at least the policy framework for it was&mdash;and the national priority or reserve fund. The latter fund gave the minister and the government the capacity to support national initiatives that had a bearing on more than one institution and were believed to be of national significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important component is the quality assurance money. The government is saying basically that they will get rid of that. We were going to scale it back and put it on a more sustainable basis, but we certainly believed that there was a need to continue that quality assurance initiative and to make sure that it had funding support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition have disparaged the impact of the framework that was introduced by the previous government for quality assurance. Their view is simply not supported by the rest of the higher education sector. I note that Professor David Pennington&mdash;who could scarcely be accused of being a strong sympathiser with my side of politics&mdash;said in his valedictory article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian's</EMPHASIS> Higher Education Supplement that the quality initiative was one of the best things we did in government and has had a lasting beneficial impact on the higher education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of funding to reward and recognise quality assurance initiatives in teaching and research by the universities was, I believe, a very important innovation of the previous government. We established a framework whereby the allocation of the funds and the quality assessment were determined essentially as a result of the deliberations of a committee drawn from the higher education sector&mdash;people of unquestioned standing in the higher education sector. That committee, the Committee for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, was chaired by Professor Brian Wilson, formerly Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its report on the changes in quality assurance practices as the result of just the first round of assessments is worth quoting. The first round outcome was spelt out in the committee's second report published in March <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1995, which described the impact of the initiative in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The response of the system to the review process has been overwhelmingly positive, with significant improvements noted across the sector. The achievements in the second round of reviews represent improvement against the evidence collected in 1993 on quality in the sector. In particular, there has been a marked improvement in quality assurance policies and practices in teaching and learning.</PARA>
<PARA>Then it went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee and its review teams were impressed by the magnitude and extent of attitudinal and procedural change evident in 1994 across the higher education system.</PARA>
<PARA>They had had a very major and beneficial impact, and that was generally conceded. I quoted Professor Pennington but I could quote half a dozen others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian's</EMPHASIS> Higher Education Supplement had a review article on the initiative published in its edition of 8 March 1995. It referred to a number of respected experts in the field and quoted a consensus in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The good administrations have used the leverage of the quality money to actually push their institutions in ways that would have taken 15 to 20 years . . . we have seen the most extraordinary shift in ground as a result of the process . . . which has been an unqualified success.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>So this has just been discarded, and institutions are somehow going to be relied on to get their act together in regard to quality assurance off their own bat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I could turn to the HECS changes, these increases in the higher education contribution scheme of course are very significant, and they serve to undermine the key equity dimensions that we in government sought to embed in the higher education system and its method of funding. The assumption is being made that this is not going to have a major deterrent effect on participation decisions. There is no evidence to support that claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that when we introduced HECS back in 1989 we did so in the context of the very major expansion in funding for the system, an expansion in places&mdash;which is in complete contrast with now. But we were very mindful and concerned about the impact that it might have on participation decisions, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3938"> on decisions to go to university or not, by disadvantaged people. In fact, we made it a requirement for the Higher Education Council to regularly report to parliament on this. We also commissioned a body of research to see what information or evidence we could gain about the likely impact on participation decisions. Most of that was reported in the Higher Education Council's report to parliament in 1992. While it showed that at the level we had pitched HECS there was some evidence of its having a deterrent effect on people from disadvantaged backgrounds, it was not a large effect. We considered on balance it was appropriate to go ahead under those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I would have to say, when you look at particular subgroups, there were some emerging areas of concern. I take the case in particular of people from low socioeconomic backgrounds and people from rural areas. When those two characteristics are combined, you do start to see the emergence of a significant deterrent effect. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The highest percentage of any group indicating that HECS would be likely to frustrate their intention to participate was 20.8 percent (for the low SES year 12 students from rural schools).</PARA>
<PARA>So, while the overall picture of the impact effects on participation decisions by the disadvantaged was acceptable on the whole, you certainly cannot contemplate ramping it up massively in the way in which it is being proposed by this government without having some serious detrimental effect on participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made no attempt to ascertain what these impacts might be. All that they are saying is that they will maintain the standing requirement of HECS to report. If you are going to make changes of this order of magnitude, there really needs to be a proper body of research underpinning it. There is not. I believe that these changes will have a major deterring effect. We are saying to people from low income backgrounds, `If you want to participate, particularly in fields of study such as medicine and law, you will have to contemplate a very substantially increased level of financial risk.' This is being <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> done without any supporting research, and I believe it will have detrimental effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that there is a strong rationale for the differential HECS structure. We contemplated that at the time of the Wran review and rejected the idea for what we considered to be good and cogent reasons. The fact is that there is not a simple correlation between people's courses of study and their subsequent earning potential. It is true that many people in particular professions do go on to earn a lot. It is not the case that all do. In the case of some fields of study particularly, those presumptions simply do not stand. We do not believe that it is a reasonable thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that the increases in HECS charges will have seriously detrimental effects from the national interest point of view in terms of the participation of students in science and engineering which are now to have their costs virtually doubled. When you combine that with the cutbacks in R&amp;D concessions our capacity to sustain high value&hyphen;added, knowledge based industries and sophisticated manufacturing and other areas will, I think, be affected in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the broad issue of equity, I mentioned that people from low socioeconomic backgrounds and rural backgrounds are likely to be the most deterred. The government and the minister have professed some concern about the fact that we did not make as much headway in raising the participation of those groups as we would have liked. That is true. But what sort of response is it to turn around and now bring in these massive HECS increases when such evidence as we have shows this to be the group which is the most vulnerable and most susceptible to having their participation decisions deterred? It makes no sense at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3939"> What the government says in the area of equity in relation to these changes is absolutely ludicrous. The proposition that by bringing in 1,000 HECS exemption scholarships a year, building to 4,000 over four years, will represent some sort of equity offset to what has been done on the HECS side and the cuts in funding is absolutely preposterous. The detrimental effects, of course, will be re inforced further by the Austudy changes, which will mean that people, in some cases in their late 20s, will be deemed to be financially dependent on their parents. If people come from a relatively low income background or where there is little history of participation in higher education, then that presumption of parental support in that age range is utterly ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of a capacity to charge undergraduate fees will reinforce the detrimental effects on equity that I have referred to. I believe there is no way that the requirement that the government says it is going to have that institutions wanting to charge fees have to first fill all their HECS places can be effectively administered. I had quite a long discussion about this with the head of the division on Monday. It is very clear that there is a whole raft of practical difficulties in the effective administration of any such scheme, and I think it will become a dead letter. Over time, what we will see in certain relatively prestigious, relatively lucrative courses of study over a period of years will be the displacement of government&hyphen;funded places with full fee&hyphen;paying places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the net effect of these changes, we believe, will be a major detriment to Australia's higher education system. They will serve to undermine what is one of the most accessible systems of higher education in the world. Certain key professions, we believe, will be entrenched as bastions of privilege as a result of these changes. The final point I would make is that the sheer moronity of the way the whole thing is being approached&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say I listened with a great deal of interest to the contribution from the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin). As he is a former minister in this particular area and somebody who, I understand, has a great deal of expertise and attachment to the matters which he just spoke on, I thought it was appropriate to act in a parliamentary way and not offer the many interjections which were running through my mind during his address, which I did enjoy. It was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an exciting and deliberate contribution to this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to move on to matters at hand. As a Queenslander, I am especially pleased to contribute to this debate because essentially what has come through the budget and what is being realised through this particular piece of legislation is, and will continue to be, good news for Queensland. Queensland is being recognised under this government for what it is: an area of great need, high growth places in university&mdash;something about which we have heard a lot from the previous government, a lot of promises, a lot of possibilities, but not much action, not much realised. What this government is doing is listening very closely to the genuine calls from Queensland, the representations from the very effective government representatives from Queensland, including your good self, Madam Deputy Speaker Sullivan, on these matters and actually coming through with the goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, of course, will make provisions for grants of financial assistance to higher education institutions and other bodies for the purposes of higher education. It will establish again changes to the higher education contribution scheme, HECS, and also the open learning deferred payments scheme. It will make provisions for the repayment of all moneys lent by the Commonwealth to students under those particular schemes. It will vary the maximum amount of grant moneys which are going for operating purposes to higher education institutions over the next three years, the triennium, and these variations mean increases&mdash;in the case of Queensland especially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased about this. In fact, my local university, Griffith University, has done especially well out of this and I will talk on it in greater detail through the course of my address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will make the standard yearly indexation for various price movements affecting all the items, such as operating grants, superannuation, teaching hospitals and special capital projects. Of course, without this sort of legislation, the moneys which are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3940"> necessary for this funding just will not go up; they will decline in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will also broaden the range of research proposals which may be approved, including research training, and it will, therefore, allow more flexibility in the system for funding of research projects. The enabling of advances of operating grants will be made for a wider range of purposes than is currently, and has been, the case&mdash;this will certainly increase the funding arrangements for higher education institutions&mdash;and advances are recovered through a subsequent reduction in operating grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In keeping with the government's commitment to equitable access to higher education, funding will be provided to trial the development of an indigenous university network. Those sorts of matters are well taken care of in this bill. It is worth noting, again for the record, operating grants in 1997 will in fact be $28.7 million higher than they were in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite tend to be the `chicken littles' of Australian politics these days, wearing their stackhats whenever they go outside because the sky seems to be falling on all fronts. The great shame about their conduct on this matter and so many other matters is the great deal of scare and loathing, the great deal of division, they seem to create. But this seems to me to have been the approach of the Labor Party on many issues over many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, of course, will be looking for efficiency dividends combined with an integrated package which will relax the administrative constraints imposed by government on universities. It will assist universities to increase efficiency and respond more flexibly to their demand. It will give universities a deal of autonomy to arrange their requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say there are some people in universities who are not overly happy with this, because government has been a convenient scapegoat for any of the inadequacies as far as those concerning increases in wages to academic staff and, for that matter, to general staff. I have certainly had representatives in my office from a number of Queensland <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> universities who have put to me very clearly the case of not having been served well by the previous government in realising wage increases. Of course, this is pretty typical right across the board in so many areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular bill will also ensure any declines in the overall operating grants across the country being partially offset by major increases in research in line with the election commitments of the coalition. Funds will be provided for a capital development pool for new campus developments and they will flow, as previously announced, in 1997&hyphen;98. Allocations for 1999 are to be discussed through the course of the 1996 profiles negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is very important from a Queensland point of view in particular because, as honourable members would know, the story as far as Queensland has been concerned has not been a good one for too many years under too many governments. In fact, since the Commonwealth government assumed responsibility for funding higher education 22 years ago in 1974, the provision of opportunities for Queenslanders has declined as the state's population has grown. In fact, the national position has gone one way, and Queensland's position has gone another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the last 22 years, there has been a lot of talk and a lot of heavy debate, both in this place and in other parliaments, such as the Queensland state parliament, about how to address this. In 1982 the state began a process aimed at persuading the Commonwealth government to redress this imbalance. Higher education growth nationally, though, was minimal between 1982 and 1988. So there was very little improvement in Queensland's situation&mdash;and this was of great frustration to Queenslanders, the Queensland government and Queensland members in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1988 the Commonwealth embarked on their program of expansion of the higher education sector, and HECS kicked in. So Queenslanders attending university were, of course, contributing directly to the overall cost of this particular level of education. Over the period of 1989 to 1993, Queensland did get an increase in the number of places which would be funded by the Commonwealth. But, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3941"> because the increments in growth were still relatively very small and growth continued on in some of the other states, this particular preferential allocation was too insufficient to bring participation in Queensland anywhere near the national average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Queenslanders are keen to learn; Queenslanders are keen to apply such knowledge and get on with things. So the argument has never rested there. Even under the previous state government in Queensland, there was a deal of effort to try to get the then Labor federal government to recognise Queensland as needing special treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through so many years the federal Labor government did not even have a Queenslander inside the cabinet. In fact, at one time the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was the cabinet representative for Queensland in the Labor administration&mdash;a member based in Perth looking after Queenslanders' interests. It was a very interesting way in which the government in this place decided to look after Queensland. Queensland still did not manage to get anywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent developments have meant a very vigorous campaign from the current Queensland education minister. I count him as a friend. He is also a very effective colleague. Bob Quinn, the Minister for Education in Queensland, has been very forthright in his advocacy and I believe he has pursued all of the federal Liberal Party representatives, with the help of the National Party representatives, to ensure we achieved the result we did out of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there was an announcement under the previous government about some increases in places, it came up with a mickey mouse formula to try to finance it and the whole thing fell into one of those smoke and mirror situations which the previous government was very famous for. It never did deliver on the places which it should have been delivering on and it has been left to the Howard government to come through with the goods. I am obviously very pleased to highlight those matters in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Griffith University, which is at the centre of my electorate, has done especially well under this budget. It is worth recounting just how <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> well it has done&mdash;in fact, all Queensland universities have done. The three highest ranking increases in operating grant variations for the 1996&hyphen;97 year are all for Queensland universities, which is a measure of the effective representation of these matters in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Central Queensland University has had an increase of 6.3 per cent and an increase of 9.8 per cent over the 1996&hyphen;98 period. Griffith University comes in second&mdash;these are national figures&mdash;with a 5.2 per cent variation in 1996&hyphen;97 and a 7.9 per cent variation in 1996&hyphen;98. James Cook University, due to the efforts of the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), has risen the third most across Australia&mdash;4.4 per cent in the current 12 months and 5.5 over 1996&hyphen;98. This is a solid result for Queensland. It is a vote of confidence from this government that Queensland has some specific needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had we not gone through with these increases and come up with the goods, accommodation at the Griffith University campus, which is already incredibly tight, would have been even tighter. The forecast was there would have been students hanging from the rafters on the Nathan campus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am especially happy to note Griffith University's 25th anniversary year. It was founded in 1971 by an act of the Queensland parliament. It is named after Sir Samuel Griffith and, when it started operating in 1975, I remember as a school boy from the local high school going to the opening day and meeting then Prime Minister Whitlam which, for a young lad of 14 or 15, was a fairly amazing feeling. He was a very tall and intimidating man but I rather enjoyed meeting him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the university opened in 1975 it had one campus with 451 students. Ten years later it had 4,000 students. In its 25th anniversary year it is Australia's 14th largest university and has five campuses and 20,000 students. It is going to get bigger because the campus at Logan, between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, can now go ahead as a result of these operating grant moneys which have been extended to it under this budget. This is very good news. The campus of the Gold Coast is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3942"> working especially well. In fact, the Gold Coast campus will pick up a lot of the growth places which will be financed and the Logan campus will provide a great deal of relief to both campuses in terms of tightness of accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My great fear is a lot of this is going to fall down a great big hole. The previous speaker, the member for Sydney, made the point in an almost virtuous way that the opposition parties, the great coalition between the Labor Party and the Democrats, are looking at blocking so many of these sensible, sound measures, which are good for Queensland, in the other place. If this occurs it will be an absolute disaster. Quite frankly, I will be leading the charge among the other Liberal members, especially from Queensland, to highlight this point: if the Labor Party and the Democrats do not do the right thing by Queensland university students and by Queensland university institutions and pass the measures which are contained in the budget to ensure the necessary money is in place to realise these long desired and long held ambitions for Queensland tertiary education, everybody in Queensland will know. The Leader of the Australian Democrats, a Queensland senator, the other Queensland senators and the remaining Queensland members in this chamber, B1 and B2&mdash;the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall)&mdash;are going to be the ones who will carry the can as far as I am concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Herbert is quite correct. They cannot understand the fact they lost on 2 March. They are forever resisting the commonsense approach of allowing this government to do what it was elected to do&mdash;run this country. They need to take a cold shower before they can start thinking about planning their way out of the wilderness. Let us get on with the job of providing those who want a university education with a university education and those who want a job the chance to get a job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal to change the higher education contribution scheme is fair, reasonable and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decent. It does not start to be repaid until people get a job. Just under $21,000 is where they start to repay their debt. So it is quite false for the previous speaker, the member for Sydney, to suggest it is going to be an iniquitous approach because those who are poor and those who may aspire to become a doctor or lawyer or be on one of the more expensive levels of HECS repayments may be left with a huge debt. They are not going to repay anything until they earn a living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As probably one of the very few people in this place who have been able to study as a result of the HECS scheme, as a mature age student, and to repay my money under the HECS scheme&mdash;I can assure you I would have liked to have kept the extra $800 or $900 it was costing me each year, on my then wage of about $35,000 a year, at tax time&mdash;I recognise the HECS contribution is a relatively very modest one. It is roughly 27 per cent of the total cost of your education costs at the higher level. In this regard I paid it. I regarded it as a contribution to the overall good of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth noting the increase in HECS contributions for those who are going to be doctors or lawyers and have the potential to earn a deal of money during their working life is regarded by them as being quite reasonable and fair. Many of them have contacted me and said very plainly the Labor Party are not representing their views and the extreme left&hyphen; wing people who dominate the student representative councils at places like Griffith University are not representing their views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people want to get on with the job of eduction even if it costs them a few thousand dollars more. As one chap, Vance Flesser of Eight Mile Plains, wrote to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> the other week, if it costs him $10,000 more for his time at university and if it takes his working life to repay the debt, so what? It is an investment in his future, and he is willing to pay for it. I think Vance Flesser and so many other thousands of university students who are realising the challenge of getting on with study, getting on with their life and being realistic should be congratulated and talked about often in this place. It is the loud, lousy minority left wing of the student unions <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3943"> which are causing so much trouble, and it is very sad to see members in this place happily give them some sort of succour in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is the HECS scheme will also make available funds, through the course of the overall costs to government, to look after those&mdash;this is something those opposite have never done&mdash;who have, from a financial point of view, a very poor capacity to go to university. Raising the number of scholarship places offered each year starting from 1,000 and up to 4,000 is a marvellous idea. It is a tribute to Minister Vanstone that she should come up with this sort of equity provision within her overall scheme as far as higher education funding is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simply put, the policies of the government, realised through the budget and essentially implemented through this bill, will make it possible for so many more Australians&mdash;happily in the case of Queensland, many more Queenslanders right across the state&mdash;to go to university. James Cook University, Griffith University and its various campuses throughout Queensland, QUT, Central Queensland University and the University of Southern Queensland will all do well under this budget. Those who aspire to going to university at those places are more likely to be able to as a result of the measures announced by this government in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to note that a lot of talk is offered about various problems associated with aspects of this budget by people who are in the system and have done very well in, I guess, the overall scheme of things over the last 10 years. A number of vice-chancellors have had two bob each way in their contribution to the public debate. I think they realise the possibility of gaining efficiencies within university institutions. The pressures are now back on the vice-chancellors to deliver the goods, and they will not be able to spread the blame, if you like, across government. They will be given adequate funds, and in a lot of cases much more funds, to run their universities. If this means academic staff and general staff have to go directly to the vice-chancellors to argue for increases in wages, then fine.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say there are a lot of stories associated with this. One of the celebrated ones which has come through my door involved a particular senior academic in Queensland who spent the money which could have been used for airconditioning one of the buildings on the campus concerned&mdash;it is not Griffith; I can say that much&mdash;on an elaborate bathroom so when he returned from jogging in the morning he was able to have a good shower on the premises. I hope this story is not true, but I have suggested to the minister she might like to look into it. These sorts of things do occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One or two small technical errors may have been made in the inclusions of certain courses. In the case of Griffith University&mdash;I will put a plug in for it&mdash;the justice administration course has been included in the top band&mdash;the $5,500 band&mdash;for repayment under HECS. It is more of a humanities course. It should be in the lower band. By my talking about it in this place I am sure the minister will look at it and ensure this mistake is addressed and we can get on with the job of ensuring more Queenslanders and more Australians are able to attend university, work hard and realise their ambitions. And not only will they do that; they will also help pay their way to ensure those who follow are also able to gain access.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When announcing the government's funding cuts to higher education, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3944"> Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) very proudly claimed that the changes would&mdash;and I quote her statement&mdash;`demonstrate the Government's real commitment to fairness and equity in Higher Education'. She is absolutely right: they do. They show a government that is entirely hostile to fairness and equity, completely uninterested in improving access for young people from middle Australia and obviously ignorant and careless of the damage they are going to do to the intellectual research and professional skills necessary for Australia's economic survival and advancement in the 21st century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very ignorant set of proposals, and I speak as someone who worked for nearly a decade in higher education institutions in Australia. It shows that the government's `real commitment'&mdash;and I underline the minister's words&mdash;is to the already wealthy and privileged, who will be offered an increasing number and proportion of places in our universities without having to compete with those of lesser means whose parents cannot afford to pay full up-front fees, and of course that is most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cynical manner in which the government exposed these changes by drip&hyphen;feed over a period before the budget and the insultingly dismissive attitude of the minister to very justified criticism have exacerbated an already destructive approach by the government. No wonder there has been a reaction from students, from staff and from academics generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has attacked the sector on every front&mdash;first of all, by cutting direct funds to the university; secondly, by increasing charges to students very substantially; and, thirdly, by reducing income support for the less well-off students. I want to deal with those issues one by one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, looking at funding cuts: 12 per cent by volume Vanstone has presided over the most retrograde and destructive decisions yet seen in Australian education, including very substantial cuts to university operating grants. I listened with some amusement to members opposite as they described the increases in funding to universities. What they are talking about are decreases over the rolling triennial <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> funding. They should look at the effects it is having on student numbers. Student numbers are actually going to decline over what was planned. Those plans were based on students already in the system and those needing to be educated, maintaining a decent rate of movement into the tertiary sector. These are cuts by any measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have also been very substantial cuts to discretionary funds&mdash;and I will talk a little bit more about that later&mdash;and of course a failure to provide any additional funds or any arrangements for much needed staff salary increases, which even the minister acknowledges are justified. Taken together, the cuts to operating grants, the cuts to discretionary funds and the failure to provide additional staff funding means that you will get effects of between 10 and 15 per cent reductions in funds to universities. That has been estimated by vice-chancellors and individual departments in some universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth remembering that some departments will have substantially more expensive staff profiles than others. Take a medical faculty for example, where many of the people are necessarily at senior levels in order to teach at the level of expertise required to prepare young medical students. I speak as someone who taught in a medical faculty for many years. Some of those departments&mdash;and I have this directly from the people involved in trying to make these changes&mdash;will actually have to cut right now their costs by 20 per cent. That is hardly an increase in funding to the universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth remembering, too, that these cuts are in the context of very explicit promises, very explicit undertakings that were given by the government when in opposition. I quote from their own policy document Quality, diversity and choice, released in February 1996. The coalition said that they will `at least maintain the real level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants'. That is clearly a broken promise. They go on to say through the shadow minister at the time, Robert Hill, who corresponded with the student body:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3945">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition has been very critical of the reduction of Commonwealth expenditure in real terms per student following the Dawkins's reforms. We think that this has had a detrimental effect on quality. It will be our objective to at least maintain and hopefully in due course to increase recurrent expenditure in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, that undertaking has clearly been breached. At the time, Senator Hill went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will maintain the level of funding of operating grants to universities and there will be no cuts in university places.</PARA>
<PARA>I underline that latter point, too, because the recent round of offers that have gone out, despite what we were hearing from one of the Queensland members, shows a cut in every case over what was estimated to be necessary. These were not some proposals that were airy&hyphen;fairy, they were required for the existing student numbers and for a decent retention rate. So we have had breaks on all of those fronts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just looking at operating grants in a little more detail: as I said, in the 1996 election the clear promise was to at least maintain the real level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in operating grants and in research grants. Anyone who has ever worked in a university, or been a student in a university, or simply been a sympathetic observer of universities will know that the two are linked. The minister made a lot of noise about increases in research funding; but, if you are actually decreasing the funding available to academic support staff and infrastructure, you might as well not bother. If you look at the total effect, you will see that it is a substantial reduction in the capacity to maintain the research effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ninety per cent of university funding is in the form of operational grants on a rolling triennium. What we have seen&mdash;and this needs to be underlined, too&mdash;is a cut of $624 million over four years. It does not matter how you dress that up; the budget papers say that is what has happened to university funding in this country. How can that be a good thing? The universities have been through the so-called efficiency programs. They have done a lot of work to improve <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quality. Incidentally, that funding will be taken away, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of these operating grants is basic. They are basically to provide for the staff, for the equipment, for the research infrastructure and support, for postgraduate awards offered by the universities, for capital maintenance and for new buildings. Cut it by $600-plus million and the effect will be devastating. Cuts will mean&mdash;and we have already seen the first effects of this&mdash;a reduction in government funded places. Students from families around this country who are not wealthy will simply not be offered as many places as they would have been in the past or they could have expected. Universities in my own state, where there is already a considerable undersupply, will lose places for both undergraduate and postgraduate courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the attention of members, including the member who spoke previously about Queensland, to the effects that this will have. For instance, in my own state Curtin University's current allocation for this year should have been $12,965. The revised allocation following these changes is $12,825. By the year 1998 it will be down to $12,605. So there will be a loss of 300 places over those two years. That is an increase? I beg your pardon, but those numbers seem to me to be going in the other direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, if you look in Queensland at the much touted increases, you will see that, yes, there are increases in some cases over the numbers that were possible last year. But when you look at the pipeline effects and other effects you realise that it is simply dumb to suggest that you do not need these increases in places with a growing population&mdash;maintaining the current retention rate and looking at the student numbers that we currently have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what they have done is effectively cut off the opportunities for a great many Australians to get into tertiary education. One of the things we as a parliament and as a government, when we were in government, could be most proud of was a very significant extension in the number of people who could get into universities. When I went to university it was a matter of great privilege that you got <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3946"> there at all. The retention rates into upper schooling were very slight. It was often only those whose parents could afford to keep them at school who benefited from the last two years of high school, let alone university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a woman, I was one of very few&mdash;and there would be many of my generation here in the same position&mdash;who managed to get into university at all. So the combination of financial support provided through Austudy and the very significant extension in the number of places, including support for those young people to stay on at high school, has meant a revolution, I think it is fair to say, in participation in Australian higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people who have looked carefully at what drives the growth in an economy will tell you that education is foremost amongst those things. In developing economies that have grown quickly, look at the attention they pay to education. It is critical; they know it. We should have learned the lessons of observing our neighbours boom ahead; we should have learned the lessons of the past. A country that is ill educated is squandering a very significant resource.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those cuts will mean a reduction in opportunities. Universities all over the country are going to have to absorb these cost reductions. In many cases, they are going to have to absorb them, according to the minister, through cuts in funded postgraduate courses. Again, this is very short-sighted. Having people go back to universities, sometimes when they are in the work force, to improve and upgrade their qualifications is very important not only for them individually and their individual skills but also for the common good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is what is lacking in this set of proposals. There is no notion that we all benefit from having an educated community, from having a community that is discerning and from having a community that has a high level of skills. There seems to be a view that it is only individually driven&mdash;that it is the financial benefit to the individual that is critical. I think this is typical of the views that are held by the government in a whole range of areas. They believe that the individual <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comes first and foremost and the community can be damned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to postgraduate courses will essentially mean that the cheaper, quickie courses, often in areas like business and so on, will survive at the expense of the more expensive and technical programs. That is hardly a boost for our technical and scientific standing in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say&mdash;and I think this is very important&mdash;that these cuts will have a very significant impact on women. If you look at staffing in our universities, you find that sadly a great many of the casual and part&hyphen;time staff are still women. The lower paid members of the staff in universities are still women. Where is the discretionary funding that the universities will be able to cut? It is with the part&hyphen;time and casual staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you will see, in my view, is a very significant reduction in those numbers. Some departments tell me that they are already doing it. They are not renewing contracts for next year. Very competent people who have often had interrupted careers because of rearing children and family responsibilities are suddenly finding that their futures are very bleak indeed. They have lost their jobs right now. As these funding cuts really bite there will be more of those people in our universities losing their positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the cuts to postgraduate course work, you will note that I have already indicated that that will generally have a detrimental effect. I think it is important to note that with all of these courses you will see a trade-off between quality and numbers. Universities will be having to make really difficult decisions about whether they continue with the number of courses available and the number of student places and sacrifice quality or whether they will further cut access, particularly to postgraduate programs, in order to preserve quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great shame for Australia that a great many of our best, particularly in science and technology, are leaving our shores. These changes will make that even more inevitable. If you go to some of the best research institutions in the United States and flick through a list of those people who are regarded as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3947"> senior and competent and indeed amongst their stars, you will find a great many Australians&mdash;far too many Australians. What we are saying to those, mainly young people, now is, `There won't be a job for you in a university because we are cutting off the opportunities generally. Research funding will not be properly supported by infrastructure and opportunities to get there via postgraduate programs will be reduced unless you are in a position to fork out a very large sum of money. You can pay for it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is all well and good but people across a range of fields, particularly the science and technology fields, whom we need in this country are not high income earners. These people do not benefit enormously financially from the very extensive and difficult training they have undertaken. The society does, but they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer too to the very significant cuts to discretionary funds of some $214.6 million over four years. This was something the government promised to do. They have honoured that promise. They have actually cut those funds out. That was then and it is now very short-sighted. These funds have been used for some very important tasks, not the least of which has been quality assurance within the universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not telling any secrets when I tell you that a lot of the teachers who begin in universities are not necessarily extremely competent at the outset. Like teachers of primary or secondary school students, they need training and assistance too. They need to be reminded from time to time of how best to communicate their subject matter. A lot of the quality assurance funds were going into improving such things as teaching expertise and making sure the university course profiles fitted the needs of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> All of these things are apparently now regarded as unimportant. For instance, the open learning initiative, which I think many people in this community regard as significant and a very great improvement in access for students in rural and isolated areas, would not have been undertaken were it not for discretionary funds. That was entirely funded out of these so&hyphen;called discretionary funds. Its begin ning and its development depended on those additional funds. It is not as if they have been somehow replaced into the system by some other freeing up of funding arrangements. They have simply disappeared. That is a net reduction in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I want to point to in relation to these increased costs is the failure to provide supplementation. Everybody agrees that, compared to almost any occupational group in the community, university academics and research staff have fallen behind in salary terms. At some point&mdash;and it is already happening, I think&mdash;these very able people that we need to teach the next generation and we need to do the research, on which our society is necessarily based, will leave the universities if they are not paid sufficiently well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easier to get a job in business and get reasonably well paid than to stay on, for instance, and teach the next generation of commerce students&mdash;ditto for law and medicine. Even in other areas less obviously connected with a professional field, many people will feel that they are not valued because their salaries are so low. We are sending them a message when we say that we are not going to provide any additional funds for the universities over any time to enable them to increase salaries to our very important university staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is an attitude in the government, and I have seen it expressed in various speeches over the couple of years that I have been here, that somehow universities are a bit of a farm for people who have nothing better to do&mdash;that is, there are all these academics wandering around wondering what to do with themselves, they do not work hard, they are not efficient and effective and they do not care about students. Nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current generation of academics&mdash;and any that I have had dealings with&mdash;include the very best. There are of course some who are not the very best, but that is true of any field of life. The universities have done an enormous amount to improve the quality of their undergraduate and postgraduate teaching. To be told that that is not valued, that they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3948"> can simply become more efficient, which is code for teach fewer students or teach them worse in larger groups, is an insult. That is basically the insult that this government has delivered along with the very significant cuts to university funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk briefly about the HECS changes. Others will no doubt raise these and I feel very strongly about them as well. Firstly, there will be a very substantial increase in the overall contribution expected. That will raise $313 million over four years. The introduction for the first time of differential HECS and lower repayment thresholds for those people already in the system and those who in the future will come into the system will again raise $817.4 million over four years. Tied to those changes is the provision to allow universities to charge full fees for students not in government funded places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are doing is hitting those least able to pay. It is an extraordinary arrangement. Everybody recognises that students should make some contribution to their own education, particularly because they individually benefit from it. But they do not benefit to the extent these changes suggest. The impact on women in particular, in some cases, is going to be ferocious. I think we will find if the evidence is collected, and it is not part of the cuts to various fact finding opportunities within government, that women actually do lose out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The substantial effects will be on those students on lower incomes. If members opposite have not talked to a few of these people who have come from families which are not well off they will not understand the difficulties faced, psychologically as well as practically. The lowered threshold in particular means that every full&hyphen;time worker with a debt will begin repayment immediately. There are very few exceptions that one can think of to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That breaks a very explicit promise made to students, `We are not planning changes to anything of the HECS scheme.' Yet all elements of it have been changed&mdash;the repayment thresholds, the absolute amounts, the differential HECS. If that is not anything, I do not know what is. That repayment threshold&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and I think it needs to be driven home to members opposite&mdash;was set at average weekly earnings. Now it is to be set at less than 74 per cent of current average weekly earnings. The disproportionate effect will be on, and most of the money will be raised from, those on less than average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does that sit comfortably with the idea of looking after the battlers? These people will be barely able to feed themselves and they will have been through several years of university when they have had difficulty doing that, too, because Austudy, parental support provided for students or working part time hardly means that the majority of these students are well off. There are some who are. I note that when the Senate was asked whether anyone had a HECS debt Senator Herron said that he did; he was paying it off on behalf of his children. Not many Australians can afford to do that. Most students have to do it themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people on below average weekly earnings will actually be below the Henderson poverty line&mdash;think about that&mdash;and be paying back their HECS debt. That is a grave insult to these people and it will make their lives extremely difficult. If members think that is fair I ask them to think again about their definition of fairness. In this area we have seen broken promises on operating grants and on HECS; we have seen changes to the arrangements which will see privileged Australians not having to compete with others because their parents can afford to buy them a place. The not so bright rich kids do well out of this budget; ordinary Australians do not. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that one of the most important issues in the lead&hyphen;up to the federal election was the question of education. I must say that I was looking forward very much to seeing the policy document. I have that policy document and I looked it up this morning. I looked at the promises made by the coalition in the lead&hyphen;up to the election and the promises made subsequent to the election, after the budget was brought down. I looked at and read some of the items that were promised. They include:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3949">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition . . . will at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants.</PARA>

<PARA>A tick for Amanda Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 the operating grants for higher education include grants for operational purposes including research, open learning, capital expenditure, evaluation and investigation as well as citizenship education. That will total about $5.3 billion in the year 1996 and is estimated at about $5.4 billion in 1997&mdash;an increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to address a particular state issue&mdash;as I am from New South Wales&mdash;the changes as they affect New South Wales universities; that is, specifically in relation to the higher education operating grants. I am pleased to note that despite the very heavy budgetary constraints the relevant operating grants for New South Wales universities in the 1996&hyphen;97 period remain at about the same levels as in the 1995&hyphen;96 period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, and unfortunately, in 1998&hyphen;99 there will be a small reduction in funding as compared with the 1996&hyphen;97 levels of just a little over two per cent. I say `unfortunately' because it is not the fault of this government that we found upon coming to government that the forward estimates that were in the hands of the previous government in February 1996 were not made public. The coalition had no idea how bad the situation was. The problem was not ours&mdash;but we have to fix it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The additional undergraduate places as announced in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget will be little, if at all, affected by the small operating reduction in the 1998&hyphen;99 period, as the operat ing grants reduction primarily and potentially are directed at postgraduate course workplaces. However, I am confident that the cost efficiency management practices that will be undertaken on an ongoing basis by the management of our universities may well mean no reduction in the future programs of postgraduate workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch briefly on some issues that have caused some concern in the community and that have not yet been raised in this debate. I want to specifically refer to the matter of HECS. As we all know, all undergraduates pay an equivalent amount for each course&mdash;absolutely identical. That has been the case in the past. That is with no regard for the cost comparisons course by course and/or the future earning potential of the graduates. This was a gross anomaly. I support the changes in the bill and I can say that the proposed changes have met a very positive response from my electorate. These changes will continue to emphasise the overall theme of the budget; that is, tough but fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All students will continue to have equal opportunities and equal access to higher education. Despite the budgetary constraints, Australia's higher education sector is acknowledged as the forerunner to our future as the leading nation in the developed world&mdash;and that is emphasised in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to stress that no student will have to pay the HECS levy until they exceed an income of $20,700 up to $21,830, at which stage the percentage rate will be applied to the local HECS repayment at about three per cent, exponentially rising to about six per cent to an income of $37,263 and above. These changes will take effect from 1 July 1997 and apply to all HECS debtors, current and future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to emphasise that Australia's system is unique in that no interest will be charged on the outstanding amount. That compares much more than favourably with the situation as it currently exists in the United States, for example, where students who want to undertake higher education have to actually borrow the money before they can enrol and they also have to demonstrate that they have the money <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3950"> before they can enrol. I think that Australia is in the forefront of allowing students of all backgrounds to undertake the courses because it will not cost them anything until they complete the course and they are earning some money. I know that this has caused some consternation in the electorate; however, I think it is unnecessary, and I do not think the opposition is doing itself much good by frightening people into thinking that this will mean that they will not be able to afford higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to mention briefly the matters raised by the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) in his address in this parliament when he spoke about salary increases and said that he found it outrageous that salary increases are not going to be included as part of the budget. I find it very strange that the opposition would continue to adopt this attitude of grave pain at the prospect of the removal of a guaranteed and specified funding for higher education. There is no doubt that higher education salary claims deserve consideration, but higher salaries are deserved by all Australians, no matter what background, and they can only be achieved by an uplift in the economy, which can occur only as the result of our addressing the huge Beazley black hole that was left to us. As I said earlier, we have not caused the problem but we will have to fix it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's emphasis is for salary rises on genuine productivity at the enterprise level. Additionally, Minister Vanstone has publicly made it perfectly clear that specific one&hyphen;off reform packages for higher wage claims will be considered and entertained if those put forward by universities encompass substantially improved workplace practices at the enterprise level. In other words, the minister requires no more and no less from the universities than the government does from all other institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the question of research grants, another matter raised by the honourable member for Sydney. Again, I am astounded to hear that the honourable member decries the budget allocation for research grants but he says nothing about what levels of funding he would like to see and how he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would rationalise that increase, what percentage increase he would like to see, how he would like to see the money raised and how he would like to see it applied. I can only say that, in these tough economic times caused by a government of which he was a part, it does not do him any good to say that there should be much more money in research grants but not enumerate what that amount should be or how it should be financed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just for the record, I believe it is important to reiterate the fact that Australia's research capacity is very strongly enhanced in this budget, despite the budgetary constraints. In fact, over the next three years, research funding for universities will be increased by more than $129 million. This will provide much needed financial support for the most basic and core needs of the research programs, and that is for infrastructure, postgraduate research training and university to industry collaborative research. This will result in an enhancement of Australia's competitiveness and will mean an increase of about 100 additional specialist research students and, just as importantly, universities and commerce and industry will be cooperating more than ever before&mdash;and that is the undisputed trend for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I just want to say something about long&hyphen;term planning. Prior to the election, I sought from the research section of the Parliamentary Library any information they could give me about long&hyphen;term planning for future education by the former government. They could provide no such document. There was nothing available that would indicate what planning the former government had for the future of our nation in this field of education. For that, I think the former government stands condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This lack of forward planning has resulted in a hotchpotch of policies and bandaid repairs. Invariably, the former government responded to those who were able to shout the longest and loudest, and it is no secret that some university institutions have done better than others, depending on their political skills and connections&mdash;and that is not the way to run the education system of any country, much less Australia. I was therefore very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3951"> pleased to note that Minister Vanstone, well aware of that failing, has announced a review of higher education. The terms of reference will soon be announced to plan ahead for the next two decades. I strongly support the bill before the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nowhere are the broken promises of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the government more clearly displayed and more evident than in this bill before the House, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. Let me say from the outset that the approach of the coalition in government and the Labor Party in government on the issue of higher education cannot be more starkly contrasted than the measures which the government is announcing in this particular bill. The Labor Party has always had a deep philosophical commitment to education at all levels in society, and postwar Labor governments held education as a central plank of their political platforms. The Whitlam government massively expanded educational opportunities at the tertiary level for young Australians, and that fine tradition was carried on by the Hawke and Keating governments over a long period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The philosophical underpinnings of our policy in the past have been to provide a maximum level of access by young Australians to the tertiary sector and, through that, to achieve greater levels of equity throughout our society. Our philosophy has simply been that quality education is not a preserve of the wealthy. Educational opportunities provide a very important means of personal development to the individuals. It is an opportunity for those who participate in tertiary education to advance themselves in an economic sense throughout their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Education is very important to Australia's long-term competitive advantage. We live in an era of massive restructuring of the global economy and of Australia's economy. We have seen the introduction of new technologies. There is a constant need for an upgrading of the skills of the work force and for an educated work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Education is the building block of industry innovation. Over the next 10 to 15 years, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> one thing that will give Australia its competitive edge in global economic markets will be its capacity to innovate, its capacity to research, its capacity to devise new industrial and production processes and its capacity to put new products into the international marketplace. To do that, you need a highly skilled and educated market force&mdash;one with a capacity to innovate not only in a product sense but also in a workplace sense. Education is very important to the underpinnings of our competitive advantage, and tertiary education is one of the linchpins of that competitive advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are benefits to the Australian work force from their participation in education. It gives Australians an opportunity to learn and they really do excel themselves&mdash;no more so than in the workplaces and on the shop floors of this country. I recently had a very interesting experience, which was shared by the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), who is with me in the House today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We visited a small engineering firm in Braeside, Melbourne, that had participated in the development of a very innovative braking technology. The person sitting at the computer screens doing the design work was a turner and fitter that had progressed from the shop floor through the ranks of the enterprise. He had been a tool maker, a turner and fitter, and was now working on the computer screens and churning out designs that the Americans cannot quite believe are coming out of a very small enterprise in Braeside, Melbourne. I mention this example because this particular person has benefited from the expanded educational opportunities that have been provided over a period&mdash;over the last 15 years, to be precise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Liberal and National parties during the election campaign made some very specific promises with regard to higher education. This is what they had to say in the context of that election campaign:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition . . . will at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants.</PARA>
<PARA>They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition additionally supports the existing Higher Education Contribution Scheme . . .  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3952"> </PARA>
<PARA>What the higher education sector got in this budget from the government was a litany of broken promises. But it is not the only area of broken promise that occurred in this particular budget. For example, the coalition broke its promise to maintain existing funding for the ABC; it broke its promise to maintain funding in real terms for labour market programs; it broke its promise to maintain the export market development grants scheme to Australian exporters, especially those in regional areas; and it broke its promise to maintain funding for the regional development program. So I guess it is no surprise that the coalition has broken its promises to the higher education community. That is a broken promise to the staff that work in our great tertiary institutions, to the students who attend the courses at them and also to the general communities in which they operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is not only the extent of the cuts in this budget which are of concern to all members of this House but also the way in which they were announced. After the election, we first of all had the trumped-up process of the government trying desperately to convince the Australian public that there was an $8 billion black hole. That process was simply designed to mask the fact that they had made around $4 billion worth of unfunded promises in the context of the election campaign and had to somehow throw up a smokescreen&mdash;a smokescreen for the cuts that we have now seen in the higher education area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) targeted the higher education sector early for treatment as far as budget cuts were concerned. We must condemn the minister for creating the uncertainty in the tertiary education sector that persisted over a period of months in the lead-up to the budget. The minister has shown herself to be absolutely incompetent, totally insensitive and really out of depth in this portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second phase of the government's planned attacks on universities occurred in its statement on 9 August where it detailed some funding decisions in the higher education area and further savings measures were announced in the area of student income support in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> May budget. The coalition's cuts in this budget go very deeply in the higher education sector. The main cuts occur to the area of operating grants. The government has indicated that it intends to cut funds for operating grants by some $624 million over four years from 1996-97 to 1999-2000 compared to the levels that were announced by the previous government. This constitutes a massive breach of promise to the Australian people and to the tertiary education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These operating grants are used to fund staff salaries, infrastructure developments at the university, equipment purchases, postgraduate awards, new buildings and capital maintenance. The cuts to operating grants will severely constrict the operations of universities because over 90 per cent of Commonwealth funding is provided in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the figures that have been announced by the government, we estimate that Deakin University in my electorate will receive in 1997 a total of $140 million in operating grants. That is down from the $142 million that would have been due to the university under the previous arrangements. In 1998, that figure will drop to $136.6 million, down from that level of $142 million. That represents a significant cut to the operating grants of the university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that we have seen cuts to discretionary funding and the government has announced cuts of $214.6 million over four years. The discretionary funding grants were used by Labor to support very innovative approaches to university funding. I understand that Deakin University in my electorate was a significant recipient of this source of funding. Programs like the quality assurance program, which is funded under these discretionary grants, have done much to change the culture of universities for the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the cuts to discretionary funding, we have a failure of the government to provide supplementation for staff salary rises. This is estimated at $300 million. Over the next four years this cut will simply put the universities under additional financial stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major savings in this budget in this sector is the changed arrangements to HECS and up-front fees. Simply put, students <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3953"> are going to be asked to pay more. We will see an increased HECS contribution for students, a lowering of the threshold at which the HECS becomes payable and, in addition to that, unis will charge full fees for places over and above the Commonwealth targets that have been set in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has excited a degree of student outrage across the length and breadth of Australia. That outrage manifested itself at Deakin University in my electorate. The Geelong Association of Students is to be commended for its ongoing campaign against these massive cutbacks in higher education by the government. The students have made their views known at public forums and at demonstrations outside the office of the Liberal member for Corangamite, Stewart McArthur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am convinced that it was only by these types of very public actions by students, academics and other staff at Deakin and other universities across the nation that the 10 per cent cut in university funding originally flagged by this incompetent minister was reduced to 4.9 per cent. But that is still, in anybody's terms, a draconian cut to the levels of funding to higher education. Through the action of Deakin students and staff, the Geelong public became very much aware of the massive threat that this government was posing to one of the city's great institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deakin students made the point that the cuts to funding threaten the viability of many valuable courses and that the changes to HECS and Austudy threaten the ability of many students to even consider undertaking a tertiary course. Of all universities, Deakin has been about providing a quality tertiary education to a broad spectrum of students in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Vice&hyphen;President of the Geelong Association of Students, Benita Crocker, said on 12 August in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Geelong Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, the proposals `rip the heart out of accessible and equitable education. Differential course fees clearly make some courses harder to access than others, therefore excluding poorer students from some courses of study'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact on regional universities will be substantial. Most of the regional universities such as Deakin University are relatively new. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They are still developing their infrastructure. They lack the financial resources of the big city universities that can call on wealthy alumni associations and that have well developed corporate links. Regional universities also service a higher proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Their importance to regional communities cannot be understated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, Deakin University plays a central role in the economic life of Geelong. It injects some $100 million into the Geelong economy, has a staff of some 1,100 people and services 11,000 people&mdash;4,500 on campus and 6,500 off campus. On a day-to-day basis, it is responsible for the injection of hundreds of thousands of dollars into the Geelong economy through the wages and salaries of staff and through the capital expenditures it makes&mdash;and that is, of course, not counting the input by the student population to the Geelong economy in the way of housing, entertainment and transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deakin is very important to the cultural life of the city of Geelong and the surrounding region. The recently completed Deakin Woolstores, built under the building better cities program, has provided the Geelong community with an excellent facility, the Great Hall, which is a world&hyphen;class entertainment venue which seats over 1,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deakin University is also important to the ongoing development of Geelong's community identity. Each region has various means of projecting itself onto the national and the international stage. In Geelong, we have a national football side and a national basketball side. We have some great manufacturing companies, such as Ford and Alcoa, in the commerce areas. Of course, Deakin and the Gordon TAFE are important providers of educational services to the Geelong community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3954"> The links to local industry are also important. Deakin Australia are a leading provider of on-the-job industry training. The model that they have developed is one which is eminently marketable overseas. I understand there have been great expressions of interest from tertiary institutions overseas in emulating the Deakin experience not only in dis tance education but also in projecting on-the-job training into manufacturing enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deakin is also an important exporter of educational services. It was one institution which took up the challenge that was put out to it by the previous Labor government to market its educational services overseas. At this point in time, some 400 to 500 overseas students attend the university each year, and, of course, it has projected itself into the South-East Asian region in providing courses in joint ventures with other tertiary institutions overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned before that Deakin is a world leader in distance education. Distance education now constitutes a very important part of the university's activity. Over half the students that are enrolled at Deakin are external students. It is the main player in distance education in Australia and one of the leaders in distance education in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deakin is also very active in the Geelong community. It has thrown its organisational and intellectual weight behind important projects in Geelong. For example, it participated in the Kelty task force deliberations on regional development. It has been a major participant on the Geelong Economic Development Board and the Golden REDO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deakin Woolstores project, which was undertaken under the previous government's building better cities program, injected $10 million into the Geelong economy&mdash;a magnificent refurbishment of the Deakin Woolstores which provided jobs for 150 Geelong building workers. It was a tribute to Geelong architects who designed that refurbishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pass on here my congratulations to Professor Geoff Wilson on his recent appointment as vice-chancellor. This follows an illustrious term at the university by Professor John Hay. I have met Professor Wilson on many occasions. He is a most astute man and he will guide this university to bigger and better things in the future. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to talk a little about the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1). But in so doing&mdash;and, as has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been indicated earlier, this is a very technical bill dealing in the main with price supplementation and some technical amendments&mdash;I will, as previous speakers have done, take this opportunity to outline the budgetary implications to the higher education sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say at the outset that I welcome this opportunity as someone who represents a university city. The University of Southern Queensland in Toowoomba now has a student population of 16,000 or 17,000. Of those numbers, about 10,000 or 11,000 are, in fact, offshore students. So it is a very important element in our higher education export arrangements. The University of Southern Queensland is regarded very highly in campuses offshore, whether they be in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have within my electorate the University of Queensland Gatton campus&mdash;the former Gatton Agricultural College&mdash;which, in itself, has about 1,800 on&hyphen;campus students, in the main dealing in areas on the land, but in particular dealing with tourism and associated activities. For my part, it is a very important element of my electorate. I take the opportunity to reinforce that today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I deal with some of the specifics of the budget, I would like to address one or two of the issues that were raised by previous speakers&mdash;in particular, one or two comments that were made by the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) and, following him, predictably, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Sydney was very critical of the attitude on this side of the House to what we had done in the budget in terms of the breach of promises. I am not going to go into any detail on that. I think it has been adequately covered by my colleague the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Zammit), who introduced into the record what we have promised and what our commitments were and, in general terms, gave a big tick to those in a number of areas. So I do not want to go into that in any detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Sydney also said that a number of us on this side of the House would make the point&mdash;indeed, I will&mdash;that this budget in the education sector <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3955"> generally has been a big winner for coalition members. It has but, more importantly, it has been a big winner right across the country. I will go into that in a little more detail in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also raised the matter of quality assurance, criticising us for the revocation of the quality assurance arrangements that the previous government had in place. Those quality assurance arrangements were a nonsense in that all they really did was perpetuate the so&hyphen;called ivy league&mdash;the more established universities&mdash;at the expense of the new university campuses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having been involved in 1995 with a visit by the quality assurance team, having gone to great lengths to outline what the University of Southern Queensland stood for in both academic and community terms, all I can say is that what emerged from the process was no reflection of what was discussed in those quality assurance inspections. I agree entirely with what the government has done in the quality assurance area and I think that the previous government stands condemned for what they tried to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Sydney had something to say about salary increases. Again, my colleague the honourable member for Lowe has covered that. It was also raised by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). There are arrangements in hand and, as the honourable member for Lowe has indicated, the government will consider those in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the honourable member for Sydney&mdash;he criticised our side of the House for a massive breach of promises&mdash;of two things that happened in higher education that fall fairly at the feet of the Keating government. In the 1993&hyphen;94 budget they changed HECS repayments so that they commenced earlier and at a higher level. Again, in 1994&hyphen;95 they made some changes to the taxation arrangements for the repayment threshold level. The honourable member for Sydney can come in here and cry tears of educational blood but they do not have any substance. He only has to look at himself in the mirror to see what his government has done in a number of those areas. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the honourable member for Fremantle did today was to reaffirm what a lot of us consider to have been the case when she was a minister. The honourable member clearly is ideologically driven; she is very political. It is my experience&mdash;I am sure it was shared by a lot on this side of the House when in opposition&mdash;that you could get very little from the honourable member when she was minister, particularly in the health area. She was more interested in the politics of the issue than the substantive issue of health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She reaffirmed that attitude today in her chip&hyphen;on&hyphen;the&hyphen;shoulder approach to this subject of higher education. She made some comments about the impact on women, and I have some sympathy with what she was saying, but I do not think there was too much substance to it. In general, I do not think that the honourable member for Fremantle added very much to the debate on higher education. She is strong on ideology and strong on her slant on philosophy, but very weak on substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support what my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) had to say about Queensland. Queensland has done well in the area of higher education, particularly in the operating grants area. The honourable member went into some detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the University of Southern Queensland is concerned, in 1996&hyphen;97 it will have an increase of 3.6 per cent and, in 1997&hyphen;98, 4.6 per cent on what it had in 1995&hyphen;96. That still poses some problems to the management on campus but it is a very positive thing and we welcome it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the Queensland education minister, Bob Quinn. The Borbidge government budget brought down in George Street yesterday reflected an increase in the education funding area. I welcome that and take the opportunity today to congratulate the Queensland government in general and Bob Quinn in particular for what they are attempting to do for Queenslanders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with what the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) said about budget outcomes, in particular that the onus now lies very squarely at the feet of individual vice&hyphen;chancellors and councils. Universities <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3956"> have to take up the challenge&mdash;a major challenge for them. On this side of the House we have always advocated devolution and greater accountability, and that is reflected in this higher education budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of Southern Queensland, Barry Leal, will take up that challenge, even though he is being replaced by Professor Peter Swannell early next year. I take the opportunity today to congratulate Barry on the great job he has done over the last few years in his term as vice&hyphen;chancellor, not only in the academic area but also in linking the university with the community. I think that is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Corio raised the local situation. I agree with him that there is a multiplier effect. It is important that educational and tertiary institutions become part of the community. Certainly that has been the case at the University of Southern Queensland. I wish Peter Swannell the best of luck as the future, from 1997, vice&hyphen;chancellor. I also want to thank Pro&hyphen;Vice&hyphen;Chancellor Craig Pearson on the campus at Gatton for what he is doing, and doing very well, in the Lockyer Valley on behalf of the wider campus of the University of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken on higher education in this place on many occasions since 1988 when I came into the House. I have gone back through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record to look at what I have said about the rationale and role of higher education. I will reiterate what I said about that in the past. If you will bear with me, in 1988 I said that higher education was at the crossroads, and I think in 1996 it is at the crossroads, simply because the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, to her credit has reorganised the roads. We will have to look at how it goes in the future. Having said that higher education was at the crossroads, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of a broader national interest, such an educational system should contribute to our economic development through growth of exploitable knowledge, stimulation of imagination, innovation, entrepreneurship and industry. It should contribute to our social development by helping to nurture mutual respect amongst individuals, safeguard <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> personal freedoms, promote tolerance and champion excellence in human endeavour. It should contribute to our cultural enrichment through the study of our intellectual and artistic heritage and the advancement of knowledge and achievement in the humanities, arts, sciences and technologies. For the higher education system to meet these expectations, it must enjoy the confidence of its students, academic staff and the community as a whole. It must also have assured sources of funds for expansion where appropriate and for continuing improvements in quality. Additionally, each institution should have sufficient freedom to determine its own direction and goals, subject to reasonable systems of public accountability for the use of taxpayers' funds.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is reflected in the initiatives announced by Senator Vanstone last month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1945 the number of students in higher education has risen about tenfold from a baseline of about 50,000, and this massive industry, if that is the right word, with its very sizeable bureaucracy, costs the taxpayers many billions of dollars per year. It is therefore sensible to ask whether this money is well spent. And that is what is reflected in this budgetary approach by the minister and by the Howard government. Clearly, our nation's economic circumstances call for a revitalised system of higher education. I also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A more effective higher education system is central to efforts to innovate industry, to raise work force abilities and to guarantee rising living standards in the future. Higher education must provide an environment of expanding opportunity to satisfy the demands of young people and others seeking to enhance their careers and to broaden their knowledge. The great challenge is to expand the capacity and to improve the quality.</PARA>
<PARA>They were the sorts of words I have used on a number of occasions in this place. I repeat them today as my view of the bottom line regarding higher education. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the House, that there is no such thing any longer as a higher educational free lunch. I think it is important that we all recognise that, whether we be parents or students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to where we are heading with higher education, I do not think higher education can be isolated from what is being done in the context of this budget. I will address this in a little more detail in the appropriation debate, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3957"> but for the purpose of this debate it is sufficient to indicate that the Howard government has announced lots of initiatives, whether in terms of schools&mdash;where we find an overall increase of five per cent&mdash;or in terms of vocational education. It is important to get the balance right, particularly regarding higher education, between what is going on and what should go on in the future as regards vocational training. We are seeing some major vocational training initiatives, particularly the apprenticeship scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think a number of misconceptions need to be cleared up as to higher education. Firstly, dealing with HECS, students do not have to pay up&hyphen;front fees. That is something that is being pushed very strongly by some of the more militant student groups. No student who qualifies to attend university will be denied entry because of their inability to pay. We heard a lot about this ideological thing regarding the wealthy from the honourable member for Fremantle. She used words such as the `wealthy and privileged'. That is a load of absolute rubbish, and I think she should understand that. Furthermore, there will be no increase in either the HECS charge or debt levels for existing students in their current courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that a lot has been said today about the differential rates. We could argue about those&mdash;and, undoubtedly, in other debates we will. But we really need to make two points: firstly, for existing students there is no change; furthermore, full fee places mean extra places at university over and above those that are federally funded. The point to make there is that overseas students for years, under Labor when it was in government, have been buying places at Australian universities. So it is only fair that under the Howard government Australian students should be given the ability to do so as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the announcements and the initiatives last month with the budget are concerned, I think we need to emphasise the very large amount of money that is being spent in higher education and, of course, in absolute terms, an additional $50 million will be spent in 1997. So that takes into consideration both the operating grants and research&mdash;and this is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> something that I think people should not forget: that there is an absolute increase when we put those two together and, of course, a very large increase in research area, which has been referred to by the honourable member for Lowe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To finish, the key challenges in the higher education area&mdash;and those challenges have to be taken up by the management&mdash;are for better management; for administrative measures which will optimise the physical and financial resources available on campus; and to cut waste. There was a very good article in the higher education supplement of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today which I suggest people should read; it is an extract from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> which is headed `Tilt the balance back to teaching'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) provides the House with an opportunity to discuss education in the Van Stone Age. It is disappointing to hear the previous speaker, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), a Liberal Party MP from Queensland, telling the House that it is time we realised there is no such thing as a higher educational free lunch. I would respond to that by saying: if you think that education is expensive, try ignorance. The fact is that, if Australia is to be internationally competitive, we need to have a well&hyphen;trained, well&hyphen;educated work force. These things are fundamental to determining our living conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was even more disappointed when I heard the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) describing her changes to higher education as `just a nick'. I understand that the education minister has a law degree up her sleeve. I could picture her defending the Boston Strangler by saying, `Well, your Honour, my client was only trying to give the deceased a neck massage.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need first to look at the background to the government's cuts in higher education&mdash;and that background is one of great achievement by the former Labor government. If you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3958"> look at education itself, we were able to more than double the participation rate. When we came to office, the number of students completing year 12 was one in three; when we left office, it was more than two in three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it was not enough just to focus on secondary education; we needed to focus on post-secondary and higher education also. Total enrolments at universities increased from 350,000 back in 1983 to 630,000 this year, with the proportion of 17- to 19-year-olds participating rising by over 60 per cent during this period. That was a revolution in participation, a massive achievement which did not just come about by accident&mdash;and I think that is one of the things that the Labor government suffered from: that our achievements in education, health, superannuation and other areas in participation are regarded as just progress, whereas they came about through hard work and commitment on the part of the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, education is vitally important for this nation's future. It is fundamental to determining our international living standards, our place in the scheme of things. I can recall Laurie Carmichael, a well-known trade union veteran, talking to trainees and graduates and saying to them, `In the past, employers were interested in your arms and your legs, in what you could do physically, the value of your physical labour. That is no longer the case. What employers are interested in now is your brain, your skills and training. That is where we need to direct our attention and our energies.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government was spreading educational opportunity to all Australians, not just those from wealthy backgrounds. Indeed, the education minister herself is the beneficiary of a free degree which she gained in Adelaide, courtesy of the Whitlam government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the coalition say they would do for higher education? Let me just quote some of the more choice quotes from the Liberal Party, because the area of higher education is one the most disgraceful in that rich array of broken promises that we have seen since the federal election. First, from Senator Robert <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Hill in a letter to the National Union of Students on 8 December last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Coalition has been very critical of the reduction of commonwealth expenditure in real terms per student following the Dawkins reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it is a slide to compare real terms per student with actual expenditure on education and higher education which was going up dramatically. But he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We think this has had a detrimental effect on quality . . . It will be our objective to at least maintain and hopefully in due course increase recurrent expenditure in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA>In that document Quality, diversity and choice at page 6&mdash;that document which is developing such notoriety as being a fraud&mdash;we were told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Coalition will at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities in terms of operating grants and research grants.</PARA>
<PARA>Then later in February of this year, once again Senator Hill, in a press release entitled&mdash;and this was the fair dinkum heading of it&mdash;`Coalition delivers on education commitments', said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Coalition will maintain the level of funding of operating grants to universities and there will be no cuts in university places.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>So once again back to that document Quality, diversity and choice. The government said it was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . committed to support high quality universities for the intellectual, cultural, economic and social benefit of the nation. A quality higher education sector is an important public resource . . . the expansion of the higher education system [since 1989] was not matched by a commensurate increase in per capita funding.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition recognises that the significant per capita reduction of Commonwealth funds under Labor has had a detrimental effect on quality. This has been evident in overcrowded lectures, unworkable tutorials and inadequate libraries. The financial squeeze also has detrimentally affected research infrastructure, research training and research capacity. Overall, this has put at risk the quality of both education and research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Higher education in Australia has been and remains overwhelmingly publicly funded. The Coalition accepts the responsibility that flows from this historical fact and while encouraging a broadening of the sector's financial base, will at least <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3959"> maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants.</PARA>
<PARA>The Vice&hyphen;Chancellor at La Trobe University, Michael Osborne, said, on looking at these quotes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to see how even devotees of Alice in Wonderland can view these commitments as equivocal.</PARA>
<PARA>And it was: it was an extraordinary set of statements encouraging students and those in the academic community to support the Liberal and National parties on the basis that they had a greater commitment to higher education than the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the coalition do? If you look at their actions, you find that there are net savings of $2 billion over four years. Those savings are to be achieved by, firstly, funding cuts; secondly, dramatically increased HECS charges; and, thirdly, making universities absorb the costs of staff salary increases to the tune of some $200 million per year. That is part of a triple whammy for young people in this country who are facing increased HECS charges and deprivation of access to tertiary education. They are facing something like $1.8 billion out of the labour market programs for which many young people have been beneficiaries. In addition, they are facing the whammy of the industrial relations legislation, whose constituent parts regarding training are a recipe for the exploitation of young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is from a coalition which said, `We've consistently opposed changes to HECS rules after a student has begun study. We'll maintain this position in government.' I refer again to that infamous document Quality, diversity and choice&mdash;page 12. We see, instead, a three&hyphen;tiered HECS system rising from $3,300 to $5,500 per annum, beginning next year, from the present level of $2,442. We see the compulsory HECS repayment income threshold being dropped from $28,000 to $20,700 from 1 July next year. So many more students, former students, will be required to repay HECS before they are earning average weekly income, before&mdash;indeed, if they have families&mdash;they are in a position to do so, putting them below the poverty line.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing the HECS repayment schedule being adjusted according to income, with those earning over $37,000 paying six per cent on repayments and, in addition, we see operating grants being cut by 4.9 per cent from 1998, with Victorian university grants to be 3.4 per cent lower by 1998. In addition, we have the option of fees from 1998 for Australian students to be limited to 25 per cent of enrolment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite the House to watch this space in years to come. This is an abandonment of Labor's position where access to tertiary education was limited only by one's academic capacity to master the courses at university. Tertiary eduction in this country will increasingly become a matter of money, a matter of the income of your parents, as a result of these changes and this is a most regressive measure which will take tertiary education in this nation back decades. Furthermore, we find that universities are being given the capacity to charge students up to $1,000 per annum for lecture notes, course materials and the like, and we are seeing cuts and changes in Austudy eligibility and other arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other areas which have not received a great deal of attention is the impact that the budget will have and the impact that we are seeing in higher education on postgraduate student places. In the Victorian campuses: Deakin will lose 125 postgraduate places in 1997 and 565 places in 1998; La Trobe, 115 in 1997 and 565 in 1998; Monash, 185 in 1997 and 875 in 1998; RMIT, 110 next year and 550 the following year; Swinburne, 10 next year and 160 the following year; Ballarat, 20 next year and 100 the following year; Melbourne, 205 places next year and 855 the following year; and VUT will lose 50 next year and 325 the following year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will have a substantial impact on the number of postgraduate places which can be offered by those universities. Government speakers who suggested that Queensland had done well out of the higher education budget might like to look at the effect of the changes on postgraduate student places in their own university institutions where, once again, they are losing hundreds of postgraduate places by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3960"> 1998. I wonder how many members of the House recall the action for breach of promise because it seems to me that the entire university community ought to be looking at a class action for breach of promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the government's defence to all this? Principally what it sought to do was abandon the use of forward estimates and minimise the magnitude of what has been announced by focusing on a comparison of the real dollar value of university operating grants in 1996 with the government's proposals for 1997, 1998 and 1999. These show apparently modest changes&mdash;a 0.6 per cent increase in 1997, followed by decreases of 1.2 per cent and 1.3 per cent below 1996 levels for each of 1998 and 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this comparison is highly misleading for the following reasons: first, university funds are allocated on a rolling triennium basis so as to provide a stable, medium-term planning framework. The former government had already announced substantial increases in funding for the 1996-98 triennium. University funding works on a calendar year rather than financial year basis. Those decisions take account of the need to accommodate continuing growth in student numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the proper basis of comparison is not with the 1996 funding level but with the provision already made for future years by the former government. In effect, the universities are still being told to take the increased student numbers but without adequate funding. Of course, in relation to the government's view of budgetary issues overall, they use the forward estimates when they want to talk about black holes and the like but here they abandon the forward estimates and seek to mislead by simply talking about real dollar value of operating grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, such a comparison fails to take into account the decision to abolish funding for a range of important programs grouped together as discretionary funds. That amounts to some $214 million over the forward estimates years. Thirdly, in addition to the cuts, universities are being provided with no additional funding or supplementation to assist with the cost of long overdue salary <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increases for academic and general staff. That means they will have to absorb an estimated additional $300 million each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taken together, those factors change the picture dramatically. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has described this as an effective cut of around 10 per cent. The Vice-Chancellor at Sydney University, Professor Gavin Brown, has estimated the impact on his university will be an effective 15 per cent by the year 2000. In his own words, `we have just bombed out on the clever country Olympics'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) described these changes as a betrayal of election promises but also as creeping Americanisation into the Australian university system. Parents who have to contemplate spending a lot more on enabling their own children to have a university education will have to start paying those amounts earlier or have their children begin paying them the moment they walk out the door of a university. They will pay more, and they will pay it a lot earlier. That will be very hard for a lot of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents in my own electorate have already said to me they believe that under the changed arrangements it will not be possible for them to send their children through university, which they had planned to do as they believed it to be very much in their children's best interests. In turn, that will adversely affect the nation as our participation rates in tertiary education stop rising, and start to fall. So it is a regressive impact. It is something which will affect this nation's competitiveness, our productivity and our living standards in years to come. It is a very short&hyphen;sighted decision. The government talks about its budget cuts as planning for the future and says it does not want to leave our children with a legacy of debt. But if we do not leave our children with a legacy of a decent education then their capacity for improved living standards will be very much diminished and this nation will be very much the poorer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude with the words of a letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 20 August which I think just about sums up the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3961"> situation. W. Lawrie of Beaconsfield in Western Australia wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Imagine Amanda Vanstone as an old farm ute. They are going to use her with abandon to paddock-bash: as a tractor, as a bulldozer, to clear the troublesome bush and the debris. They will drive her as far as she will go. No matter if she gets dented or scarred, and there is no question of resale. No, she is the blunt instrument of progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One day, of course, like all those old utes she'll come unstuck. Far from home, the sump with get holed on a difficult issue, or the clutch will finally burn out on the steepening incline of public resistance, and she will stop. When this happens they will simply get out and walk away. There will be no salvage. They will just leave her to rust in some distant paddock. She will have served her purpose.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that the quote by the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) of a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  had very much at all to do with the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1), and it certainly did not in any way portray the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone). As I know and understand her to be, there is no way Senator Amanda Vanstone is going to be or find herself stuck in some distant paddock, unable to get home. Senator Vanstone shows considerably more tenacity than the member for Wills has given her credit for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a little surprised as I listened to this debate. I switched on my television monitor when the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) led the debate for the opposition. He said that this was a bill without any contention at all. In fact, he said this is a bill the opposition were happy to support. So it was a little surprising that the opposition have made so little reference to the bill before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It suited the opposition, as is often the case&mdash;not so long ago I was a member of the opposition, so I understand the temptation&mdash;to run down the issue of education, HECS and the changes in education standards as they see them, when in reality the bill before the House deals, as I understand it, with a number of what might be called housekeeping measures, which are generally agreed, I hope the member for Wills would concur, between both government and opposition, though the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Corio (Mr O'Connor)&mdash;and I concede that he was busy at a committee meeting and therefore rushed into the chamber just in time to address it&mdash;was clearly unaware of the level of bipartisan support for this legislation that exists across the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a non-contentious bill. In fact, the purpose of the bill before the House is, in simple terms, to vary the maximum grant amounts that are available for the years 1996, 1997 and 1998; to offer some additional financial flexibility, particularly to tertiary institutions; and to provide some simple amendments to the names of a number of tertiary institutions. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), who has had an active association with the Marcus Oldham Farm Management College, would be aware of the proposal to change that to the Marcus Oldham College.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also allows changes in the obligations that open learning agencies have to report to other government agencies, and repeals are no longer a necessary provision for the Aboriginal participation project because that has now been consolidated with the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program. So, as a general rule, this is a bill about which there should be no controversy. But people in the gallery and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss, could be forgiven for imagining that in fact this was a bill that was acutely dividing the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wills was very anxious to point out all of what he saw as the shortcomings in the government's approach to education and in the changes announced by Minister Vanstone in the run&hyphen;up to budget night and on budget night. The reality, of course, is that we understand those protests; but we as a government also understand what it is that has driven the government and the cabinet to make these unpopular decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a great deal of indignation expressed initially by the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), by the member for Corio and by the member for Wills about the whole concept of what I will call pay as you learn students&mdash;indignation that anyone should be able, in the words of the opposition, to buy <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3962"> their way into university. Yet the reality is that all that Senator Vanstone has done with this provision is to allow those who can afford to buy their university education, or rather to pay for their university education, to do so and in the process to generate additional funds for tertiary institutions so that they can allow enrolments to increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We already do this. We do it without demure in the case of overseas students and we see it effectively as a way of generating what might loosely be called export income. But when we offer the same provisions to Australian students, for some strange reason beyond my understanding, the opposition sees it as discriminatory. Every one of those students who will have the opportunity to pay their full fees will be creating a larger capital base for the tertiary institution and further opportunities for other students to be directly involved in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the other debate about these provisions has focused around the whole issue of the changes to HECS. I thought it might be useful therefore to go back to some of the statements made about HECS when the opposition, as the then government, introduced the scheme. Then Treasurer Dawkins, as he introduced the scheme, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The higher education contribution scheme is an essential part of the Government's plans for expansion and development of the higher education system.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as important, the scheme will increase the fairness of funding arrangements for higher education, ensuring that the total burden of funding does not fall entirely on the taxpayer. For these reasons the Government believes that the introduction of the scheme must be a pre&hyphen;condition for implementation of the other aspects of its higher education package.</PARA>
<PARA>Deja vu, one might observe. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has framed its legislation accordingly. In the event of significant amendments or outright rejection of those provisions of the Bill giving effect to the higher education contribution scheme, the Government will have no alternative but to curtail its plans to expand higher education. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>In an adjournment debate the former member for Oxley, Mr Les Scott, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is little doubt that, whilst some students have expressed their concerns about HECS and what have you, HECS does provide the opportunity for a tertiary education for all people, no matter what their financial backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps even more tellingly, in an answer to a question without notice from Mr Gibson&mdash;one might query the term `without notice'&mdash;the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As one of the small measures we put in place to encourage that growth, we decided that people taking a second degree should pay twice the level of HECS. They do not have to pay it up front. But, over time, if they want to avail themselves of a heavily subsidised place and continue in that heavily subsidised place, they should in fact be responsible for picking up double HECS.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not affronted by that and the present opposition ought not to be affronted by the changes we have made which allow tertiary institutions to continue to offer the standard of education Australians have come to expect in spite of the budget deficit the government now finds itself obliged to address. Finally, may I quote from the now Leader of the Opposition. On 27 September 1993, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When we introduce a small element of market pressure to encourage students to complete their degrees in the minimal possible time, it raises yet another undisciplined shriek from the opposition that we have to cut outlays. But when we put up a proposition for a cut in outlays, the Leader of the Opposition, or some of his spokesmen, runs a hundred miles back from it.</PARA>
<PARA>The latter part of that was quite untrue. In fact the government has been prepared to cut outlays in order to ensure that the budget deficit that we inherited&mdash;for which we have no direct responsibility, but which we accept the role we now have of cleaning up&mdash;is addressed. When we take action to ensure that that deficit is addressed, and it has obliged us to cut outlays in a range of areas, the now opposition comes in acutely critical of the changes proposed in the tertiary education area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone in this House would agree with the member for Fremantle when she said in her speech just a few moments ago that a country that is ill educated is squandering a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3963"> valuable resource. Of course that is true. Everyone in this House would agree with Lord Brougham when, in the middle of last century, he said, `Education makes a people easy to lead and difficult to drive; easy to govern and impossible to enslave.' There would not be a member of the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Independents who would not want an Australia full of people `easy to lead and difficult to drive; easy to govern and impossible to enslave'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to ensure that we can get the maximum participation in our tertiary education system we have been forced by the deficit to make some changes to the HECS arrangements. To suggest that those changes deny young people who come from a non&hyphen;privileged background access to the system is nonsense. No-one is obliged to make a HECS repayment until they have generated a taxable income of $20,000 or thereabouts. Anyone can access tertiary education regardless of their parents' background and their parents' resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only thing that restricts access for those who come from non&hyphen;privileged backgrounds is their academic record. Those from privileged backgrounds who might find their way in in spite of their academic record will either work or be caught up by the system of testing that we have at the tertiary level. This will ensure that they do not get a degree unless they have passed. In the process, they will have made a contribution that has opened up other places for less privileged Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am the father of two children who are currently in the tertiary education system. Both of them are on HECS. Both of them begrudgingly have to accept the fact that, in spite of my privileged background, I am not going to pick up any of their HECS payments. Both of them are, as a matter of fact, in the work force in order to sustain the lifestyle to which they think they should have become accustomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They may not be happy about it, but without apology I believe that the HECS system means that they will see their degree as theirs. The fact that one of them is doing law and will therefore be obliged to meet a higher <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> HECS repayment is something that I make no apology for because surely her additional income earning capacity will make the proportion of her HECS fee incidental in the total scheme of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us draw some parallel about equity. What do you do if, instead of choosing to be employed in a vocation that reflects your tertiary education, whether in medicine, law, vet science, pharmacy or anything else, you choose as a non-tertiary educated person to go into business? Let us say that as a non&hyphen;tertiary educated person you choose to be a plumber. Does the government say, `Here we are, we will effectively hand you 75 per cent of the cost of establishing your plumbing industry'? Of course it does not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It says instead that you will go to the bank and no matter what your income from year one you will be obliged to repay the total cost of the utility, the ditch witch machine and the other things that are essential to a plumber. We are saying that, if you are going to access a tertiary education and as a result be a better remunerated Australian, it is not unreasonable for you to be making a contribution to the total cost of that tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can draw the analogy in a range of areas. We do not buy dentists their chairs or their drills. We do not buy fruit growers their fruit growing properties&mdash;something with which I have some familiarity. Instead we say to people, `You will be obliged to meet the total cost of setting up that business.' Under the HECS scheme introduced by the now opposition and modified by the government because of the level of debt, all that we oblige young people to meet is a maximum of 23 per cent of the cost of their tertiary education&mdash;a tertiary education that we trust will open the doors to a better lifestyle than they would have otherwise enjoyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3964"> Let me conclude by picking up on a couple of other comments made by the member for Wills. The member for Wills said that one of his trade union friends had in conversation indicated that society had so changed that employers no longer want arms and legs but want brains. I am an employer. Let me tell you what I want out of an employee. I want innovation, I want initiative, I want a prepar edness to work and to contribute, and I want a real sense of fulfilment and identity with the job at the end of the day. None of those objectives are frustrated by the changes we have made to HECS and they are certainly not frustrated by the bill now before the House which actually has bipartisan support.</PARA></SPEECH>

This myth that has been created is underpinning much of the rationale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been told ad nauseam that the whole of society has been pushed into recession by government panic measures to try to justify its ideology. We have been told about intergenerational debt and how we are going to pass on to our children a massive debt that they are going to have to repay. The fact is that we pass on to our children a lot of things. We pass on infrastructure such as highways, railway lines, ports, airports and buildings, and hardware and software. We also pass on a lot of people. These things we pass on can be seen as debts or assets. Let us talk about the 200,000 or more people who will never work again because of this government. That will be a massive debt. We cannot put a figure on it, but in social costs and eventually in dollar costs it will be massive. What about the thousands and thousands of future generations of people who will be undereducated? What will that cost them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the run down on assets? Anybody who has been to any of the great cities of Europe or a place like Los Angeles will have seen the asset run down being passed on to future generations and the cost to them to maintain, repair or rebuild those assets. Look at the cuts to the national highway spending and the kind of degradation in the assets being passed on by this government. They want to put things in money terms only. Why is that? Why don't we see the whole picture? Why don't we hear about equating things <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the value of the totality? The fact is that our greatest asset and our greatest resource is our people. Our human capital is our great resource. How we treat that is fundamental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to the 1950s and 1960s&mdash;previous government speakers have referred to the tenfold increase in university enrolments since the 1940s&mdash;when fees were paid. I was one of those students who had to pay fees up&hyphen;front every term. I had to pay my money each term for each subject and then I could go into classes. I eventually obtained a Commonwealth scholarship, but most of the students at my university were on teachers college scholarships. They signed up for nine years of their lives when they were 16 or 17&mdash;four years at university and five years teaching&mdash;for a &pound;5,000 bond back in the 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a lot of students there for a long time. I can recall some students who were there for six or seven years and haven't passed yet. They could afford it; it was a nice lifestyle. Their parents had their children at university&mdash;it was a nice thing to do. But the fact is that most of those people who were on bonds or Commonwealth scholarships were from working&hyphen;class, poorer families with no history of education. The participation rate at universities was very low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go on to the early 1970s and the Whitlam government. They did two things: they abolished university fees, to give access, and they introduced TEAS, the tertiary education allowance scheme, which basically said, `Why pay people not to work and not to go to university?' So the TEAS scheme, when it was first brought in, was based on the unemployment scheme. That was aimed at trying to shift the balance because we as a country were undereducated and underskilled. In other words, our greatest resource, our greatest asset, was not being developed and, therefore, a debt of underdevelopment was being passed on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know how TEAS was not increased between 1975 and 1983, how the dead hand of Fraserism put a clamp on the whole scheme, basically because they were against the idea of people being able to be supported while they were students. The rate of increase <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3965"> for TEAS did not match the cost of living increases so TEAS got further and further behind&mdash;and the gap between TEAS and the dole grew.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1983 when we came to government we had a participation rate in high schools of one&hyphen;third. Thirty&hyphen;five per cent or so of students went on to year 12. That rate was one of the worst in the Western world and an absolute national disgrace. Who was Treasurer then? It was the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard). This is the person who is now telling us what we have to do, yet he committed a generation of young Australians to being undereducated&mdash;and he wants to do it again now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the rationale behind it all? Again, it is the idea of intergenerational debt. The debt he passed on to us from 1975 to 1983 is still being felt because many of those people who are out of work now were not educated well enough when they were at school in the 1970s. That is part of the debt that the previous Liberal government passed on to us in 1983&mdash;and it is being passed on again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rationale and the whole point of the introduction of the HECS scheme, which many of us were concerned about, was that if we were to develop and fully utilise the resources of our country we had to educate our people, which meant that education had to go at a faster rate than the rest of the economy. Hence the concept of some contribution, retrospectively, after people received the benefit&mdash;not beforehand&mdash;and hence the introduction of the HECS scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker referred to remarks in 1993 by the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). The whole point of the introduction of that scheme was to try to find the balance between increasing expenditure at a much greater rate than the economy, which was needed to catch up on the backlog, and some sense of equity between those who benefit and those who contribute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we took the view that only those who benefit should pay and put that right throughout our society, we would have a very weird situation. How many libraries would we have, how many swimming pools and how many clubs? What kind of society would we have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if we built and provided things only for those who used them? What kind of attitude would that indicate? It would mean that people who grew up and did not have children would not pay to get kids educated at school: because they have no children why should their taxes go towards public education? It would mean that people who had minor illnesses would not help pay for people who had medical catastrophes? What kind of society would we have? This is what is being put forward here. The previous speaker quite unconsciously, in putting forward the view of the plumber starting his business, did not mention the plumber's training which we all agree we helped pay for through the TAFE system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst all the assumptions there is still the underlying assumption that we share the cost of some things. But what we are seeing with the government now is the ideology coming forward that we can start to select, we can pick winners and we can pick areas where people will be charged. That, in theory, is being done altruistically, but what is really being done is discriminatory. When we go back and look again at the TEAS scheme, which was aimed at universities, it becomes obvious that in that period between 1974 and 1983 one of the real hindrances to education was not at university but at high school. To keep a young person in high school for the additional two years for many families was a burden they could not handle. One of the greatest things the Labor government ever did was to extend Austudy into years 11 and 12.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are tens of thousands of people now who are well educated because they were able to get support in years 11 and 12. And that was a major change in attitude from the government and from the community. That extension of the education of our people has required a great change in the areas of financing, structures and attitude. Now we hear the  Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) talking about how the 60 per cent increase in education was a pay&hyphen;off to mates and that somehow this was some kind of rort or cheating and the rate of education increases was faster than the rate of spending on roads. What a hide, what audacity, when the minister knew at the time <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3966"> she was saying that that sitting in the bank was almost $4 billion in HECS fees and outstanding charges which have been accumulated, which will be recovered by the government in the years ahead. Where is the $4 billion in the road budget being provided separately in the same way? Of course, there is nothing. It is outrageous to attack and portray as some kind of pay-off to a sector for its support the rationale of putting in some charges to recover funds to allow us to educate our people at a higher level and at a faster rate to make up for the years of neglect that we had suffered. In fact, it is not just outrageous; it is blatantly fraudulent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this government came to office on a whole lot of promises. There has been no doubt in my mind, during the campaign or since, that they lied. There is no doubt that every shadow minister in the campaign lied and knew they were lying&mdash;regularly, consistently and openly. And there is all this mock horror at this so&hyphen;called deficit, which, quite frankly, is as long as a piece of string. If getting rid of it was so good for the economy, why get rid of it all now? If it is so beneficial and so wonderful, why not wipe it out tomorrow?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that one weighs up the costs and benefits, in monetary and other terms, of how we run the economy. You make a judgment as to how many people you sacrifice for the deficit you have, and this government is sacrificing hundreds of thousands of people who are long&hyphen;term unemployed and who, given the changes, will never work again. Make no mistake: there are hundreds of thousands of Australians now out of work who will never see a job again in their life because this government has made that choice. The cost to our community in the years ahead will be horrendous but it will be obscured. It will not be visible or measurable in the way that a university cost might be or the cost of Austudy might be, but in social strife, lost resources and human dignity damage it will be enormous and we may never recover from it. The members of the present government are the people who talked for years about an underclass. What they are creating is not an underclass but a totally <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> subterranean class who will never see the light of day again&mdash;because not only have they pulled away all the resources to help them get back into employment; they are also putting in more punitive measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole debate has been a charade because it is based on the false premise of some so&hyphen;called debt or deficit. It is going to ebb and flow as people start to understand what is really involved and when we start to see the enrolment figures in the years ahead. The fact is that universities like Newcastle, I have no doubt, will be a victim of this&mdash;not simply in terms of their funding program but of a perception problem. In the days when I was a fee paying student, students who were paying their fees tended not to go to places like Newcastle because it was not prestigious. The regional and provincial universities were not the places to go. If your mum and dad could afford to pay your fees, you went to Sydney or Melbourne&mdash;less often to New South Wales in those days, quite frankly, because it was also not all that up&hyphen;market. Sydney was the university, and anybody who could afford it went there. Those differences will come back. Students who would normally come to Newcastle from various parts of Australia will now go to universities which rank them higher in the future employment stakes because of the badge they wear afterwards. We all understand the red brick, ivy league mentality. We all understand the old school approach. That is being brought back now with a vengeance with the changes the government is introducing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time we have people crying out&mdash;or pointing out, as the Karpin report did&mdash;and I quote from a letter by Mr Vines from the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers, which was published in mid&hyphen;August. Mr  Vines quotes the Karpin report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only 25 per cent of our managers hold degrees whereas in the US and Japan the figure is more than 80 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not a politician talking; this is someone saying, `Look, the people who are running our country are undereducated now, not in five or 10 years time. There are about one&hyphen;third as many people educated in Australia as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3967"> in equivalent countries.' Yet here is the government saying, `Well, let us undereducate them some more. Let us make it even tougher.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had almost a faux pas earlier from the honourable member for Wakefield when he talked about people having to repay their fees. He was forced to put in the figure of $20,000 as the recovery rate. The whole point of that HECS recovery rate was that people would not have to start paying until they had actually got the benefit and were getting at least average weekly earnings of $28,000&mdash;at least getting a decent income to pay from, and then the rate increased, depending on their income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal now is to cut that rate to $20,000, which means that many people doing university part time and in work and with children will be paying back the HECS fees while they are still doing their course because they will be earning more than $20,000. So, on top of feeding the kids and paying their course costs for books, transport and all the rest of it, they will also be having their HECS fees levied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the way to encourage people! What will happen is that people will go back to the old days, back to the 1960s, when less people went to university. Those who come from a background where they are confident of getting work will go to universities and those who do not will not. The culture in Australia has been not to be educated. The culture in places such as Newcastle, which for most of my life has had less than the state and national average of tertiary education people entering the work force, has been, `Why bother getting educated? What is the point?' The legacy of all those years of conservative government is don't encourage education. As I said, our greatest resource is our people, but the messages that this government is giving are in fact the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the headlines we see things like `Fees cut blow to the clever country', `University rise threat to high tech aims', and `HECS cuts blow to agriculture say universities'. All through the media, since some time in July, the message coming across to the community at large is that education is a no&hyphen;go area. If they change it once, they will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> change it again. This is only the first chop. The message all the way through has been that it is going to get heavier and heavier. So, if in doubt, don't.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will mean that those bright young Australians who have something to offer this country will not be developed. They will be pushed into underemployment. They might get a job as a bank clerk and have a great future there. They might become a manager one day. But don't think of being a scientist or an engineer or an architect because they might not quite make it, they might fail, and with this $20,000 recovery rate, even as a bank clerk, they will still be paying back HECS fees. The whole point was that HECS fees were only applicable if you were able to earn enough money. What has been brought in now is that HECS fees will be applicable at very low income levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned earlier, Newcastle will suffer not just from the cuts but from people shifting location. We are already hearing, anecdotally, from staff who work at the university and from students that people are saying, `Oh well, I might shift next year. If I can go somewhere else, I will. I will have a better chance if I get a degree from Sydney because it is more prestigious.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the first of what will be a series of debates. The debates will not in one sense be about education; they will be about philosophy and ideology. But, most of all, they will be about the fraudulence of this so&hyphen;called deficit which is driving an ideology that is pushing us back not just to the 1960s but to the 1950s. The pattern of education in Australia was laid down postwar, in the late&hyphen;1940s and particularly the 1950s. We are going back to those days. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. I commend the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, on her vision for a responsible, equitable and balanced approach to providing access to higher education. On 9 August the minister announced that the Howard government would fund universities to provide 4,000 merit based <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3968"> scholarships for disadvantaged students over the next four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also announced a continuation of the $5.28 million annual budget for the higher education equity program and an allocation of $750,000 to extend the regional disability liaison officer initiative for another year. Commonwealth funding for higher education, both operating grants and research, will increase by $51.1 million in 1997. Operating grants in 1997 will be $28.7 million higher than in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The efficiency dividends sought from operating grants are partially offset with major increases for research, in line with election commitments. As well, in line with election commitments, there will no increase in either the HECS charge or debt levels of existing students in their current courses. The deferred payment, income contingent, interest&hyphen;free features of HECS will be retained; no qualified student will be prevented from having access to higher education because of their ability to pay at the time of entry. The minister has recognised that if you come from a socioeconomically disadvantaged background, or from a rural or geographically remote area, your chances of being able to go to university are much less than if you come from a more socioeconomically advantaged background and if you live in an urban area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would particularly like to emphasise the equity principles in relation to the balance between public and private funding. I listened with interest to members on the opposite side talking about the impact of the budget decision on those who may be deterred from studying at university or in higher education by the increase in HECS fees. I have never heard anything so hypocritical in all my life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It so happens that in my electorate of Makin, until recently, the University of South Australia, which has a specific charter of equity and access, had a campus situated at Salisbury. The decision to close Salisbury campus was made in 1992 under a Labor government when the Minister for Employment, Education and Training was Simon Crean. I would ask: where was the concern then for social justice, equity and access to tertiary education?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the coordinator for the Save Salisbury campaign to keep access to tertiary education in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, I would have to say that our pleas for the retention of the campus fell on deaf ears. There were many delegations by students to the then minister, Simon Crean, other members of parliament and to the chancellors to reconsider their commitment to social justice, equity and access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a student at the University of South Australia, Salisbury campus, I would say I was fortunate in being able to complete my degree before the transfer of courses to other campuses. As a mature aged student and sole parent of three boys, working part time, it was a very difficult but rewarding challenge to complete my degree. However, each week I would have to literally measure the petrol in my tank and budget to the very last dollar to enable me to travel to the nearby campus to attend lectures. I was not alone in this. Many of my fellow students were in similar positions to my own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the location of the campus that enabled me and other families in the northern suburbs and nearby rural areas to obtain access to a tertiary education facility. So much for the hypocritical concern from members on the other side for social justice, equity and access to tertiary education. The majority of students attending Salisbury campus were mature age students, many of them women who came from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that I was able to defer HECS payments meant that I was able to commence my degree without the concern of having to find an up&hyphen;front fee. I have no problem with paying for my education on a deferred basis and I commend the minister for the continuation of the opportunity to existing and new students to have access to tertiary education through deferred HECS payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many constituents have contacted my electorate office in Makin to convey to me their belief that the differential charges are fair and equitable, especially as those who are able to complete their degrees will have a greater opportunity for employment at a higher level of income. As one blue-collar <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3969"> worker from my electorate said to me the other day, why should he work his heart out in a factory on low wages with his taxes contributing to the education of potentially high income earners and they not contribute themselves? One important issue that those on the opposite side have failed to recognise is that savings have had to be made because of the legacy of debt left to Australians by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996 provides for responsible levels of funding, teaching and research, a fair balance between public and private funding, additional opportunities and choice for Australian students, quality assurance and improvement, a more strategic relationship between the Commonwealth and institutions and, most importantly, a stronger commitment to equity than has been demonstrated over the past 13 years by the former Labor government. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the major amendments proposed by the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996 is to vary the levels of grants for higher education institutions for the years 1996-1998 and to provide for advances of grants for expenditure for operating purposes to higher education institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Higher Education Funding Act the Commonwealth provides funds to the higher education institutions and funding is provided on a rolling triennium basis, which means that the level of funding is known for the next three years. The principal act also establishes the higher education contribution scheme and the open learning deferred payment scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the 1996 election campaign the Liberal and National parties gave a number of commitments in relation to Commonwealth funding of higher education. One such commitment was that `the coalition will at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants'. That was contained in the Liberal Party higher education <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy, `Quality, diversity and choice', dated February 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further promise was that `the coalition will continue the practice of funding universities on a rolling triennium basis but will modify the mechanism for the allocation of Commonwealth funds, putting less emphasis on a formula funding model'. That was in the same document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A third promise was that `the coalition recognises that new funding must supplement and not replace the public contribution. The coalition does not intend to change the public structure of our universities'. Yet another promise was that `the coalition additionally supports the existing higher education contribution scheme'. They were all promises made in February of this year and were fundamental to the way people voted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation, while perhaps non-controversial, does reflect the fact that the minister in having a discretion as to the funding that is made to universities over the next triennium very much has a tremendous power over those universities as to how they will behave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, this legislation varies the amounts payable to the higher education institutions as operating grants and for superannuation and for other expenses for the 1996 triennium. However, it is the aspect of the discretion which gives us some concern, particularly in light of the government's budget cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of the background as to where we stand with the current operation of universities, I was educated as a result of the opening up of universities during the period of the Whitlam government. Australians have become intensely proud of our higher education system and it is one which is regarded as one of the most equitable and accessible in the world. Under the last Labor government, enrolments grew from 350,000 in 1983 to 630,000 in 1996, with the proportion of 17&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds participating rising by over 60 per cent during that period. Those 17&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds had been given the opportunity by Labor to have a go and, whatever their social background, to realistically aspire to becoming whatever they wanted to become. Whether <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3970"> it be a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant, a scientist, a teacher or whatever, they have had that opportunity and were entitled to have those aspirations. One must seriously and regretfully wonder whether they will still be able to have those dreams as legitimate aspirations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Academic achievement rather than financial status has been the determining factor, but now all that will change. This bill is one of the government's sleight of hand tricks. It specifies that a maximum figure may be payable, deluding the Australian people to think that funding has not been cut. But it must be seen in the context of the overall budgetary strategy. Over the four forward estimate years for the current budget, from 1996&hyphen;97 to the year 2000, funding will be cut by over $1.8 billion, in combination with massively increased HECS charges. In addition the universities will have to absorb the cost of staff salary increases which will cost close to $300 million a year. Here again, unfortunately, we see a return to the days of the Fraser government where it is convenient to brand and alienate different sections of the community, and academics have, regrettably, in some quarters been portrayed as rorters in an endeavour to convince the public that they are unworthy of pay increases to keep pace with the rises in inflation. This is just another instance of seeds of division being planted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The medium&hyphen;term funding security provided by Labor through the rolling triennium arrangement, which the universities saw as essential, is now under threat and the hierarchies of the universities will be beholden to the will of the government and in particular the minister in exercising her discretion to make payments or not to make payments to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allowing universities to charge full fees to some students will mean a progressive substitution of full fee paying students for HECS paying students particularly in the more sought&hyphen;after courses which lead more frequently to lucrative careers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As universities become increasingly squeezed by this government, that must be seen as an inevitability. The whole mode of operation of our university system will become equiva lent to the Bond University's. I am not criticising that university, but it is one where people who have the means of paying full fees have the ability to obtain a degree which otherwise may not have been accessible to them. The fact of the matter is that if universities wish to develop and indeed wish to progress, and they have an option of taking on fee paying students or non&hyphen;fee paying students, they are, as the squeeze gets tighter and tighter, going to be left with very little option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the days when my sisters went to university&mdash;and I do not want to pinpoint their age but it was before the period of the Whitlam government&mdash;it was quite unusual to find young adults from public schools in the prestigious courses of law, medicine and dentistry. Those who were in those courses were usually the extremely talented kids who obtained Commonwealth scholarships, as they were known in those days. To their credit, my sisters both obtained those scholarships, but to obtain them they both had to come dux of their high school. That was the sort of academic achievement that was required to obtain those scholarships. Many of their friends, while performing admirably, simply missed out on a Commonwealth scholarship. They could not aspire to the more prestigious courses. The best they could hope for was enrolling in teaching, where the state government offered teachers college scholarships. But even those young adults were tied as teachers for a period equivalent to a national service of three years, and they had to pay back their bond if they left in that time. They were obliged to go wherever they were sent by the education department in order to avoid paying back that funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the means which even talented kids from less well&hyphen;off backgrounds had of obtaining tertiary qualifications, by going through the teachers college scholarship rather than through the infrastructure developed by the Whitlam government. Unfortunately, it will not be very long before we return to those two streams. There will be a situation where those from more well&hyphen;off backgrounds will be able to access the more, for want of a better word, prestigious courses or the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3971"> courses that lead on to more lucrative careers. Indeed, it may not be such a bad thing for many of those kids from those privileged backgrounds to open up a few places for themselves by removing people who would not be able to afford to enter those courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation that confronted my sisters has dramatically changed as a result of the policies of the Whitlam government. I entered university in 1976 and at that time there were students from all backgrounds entering the courses. I have seen a dramatic change in my former profession, the legal profession. There is a definite division between those over about 45 years of age involved in the profession who predominantly came from private schools and those who are more my contemporaries where really the mix was quite even, if at all relevant. Indeed, a number of my contemporaries from Blakehurst High School have gone on to become partners in very substantial legal firms. I refer to them by way of an example. That would have been a very unlikely event before the period of the Whitlam government. The major professions were seen as the domains of the privileged classes. The judiciary itself substantially came from that privileged background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The element of privilege&mdash;the element of wealth&mdash;has substantially gone out of our society, so that particular upbringings have become irrelevant. There are a number of very successful people in all walks of life who have obtained that success despite coming from poorer backgrounds and our society is all that richer as a result of what has occurred. This shift in education policies of the present government is significant and one which, if it is allowed to continue, over time will result in a reversal of that trend, which is a trend of success on merit, rather than privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thrust of the government's policy is underlined as a result of a number of similarly harsh measures. For instance, given the already existing obligation to meet higher HECS fees, ranging up to just over $5,000 for some courses per year, the government has lowered the level at which students or former students must kick in to refund that money to a level of about $20,000.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the age at which you can enter university as a mature student with Austudy assistance has been raised from 22 years to 25 years. Given the underlying cost structure, while many young people will decide to go out into the work force in some temporary capacity to earn some money to meet their university fees, when it actually comes to setting aside the time to undertake the study, they will be reaching an age of 25 when, quite obviously, many of them will be assuming mortgages; many of them will indeed be assuming the responsibilities of children. The facts of the matter are that, confronted with all those responsibilities, the burden of having to go without Austudy until age 25 may well preclude a great number of people from ever obtaining tertiary education. After 25, it is all that much more difficult to set aside the time to undertake a course. That will cause not only great personal losses, but a loss for the Australian society as a whole because we will lose a considerable body of talent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said that the proposed funding arrangements will be no more than a `nick' in the budgets of the universities. That is, with the greatest respect, a load of rubbish. The Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee has put the effective cut at around 10 per cent, while Professor Gavin Brown, the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of Sydney University, has estimated the impact on his university as effectively a 15 per cent cut by the year 2000. I sincerely trust that he, having had the courage to express his mind on this point of view, will not be penalised by an exercise of discretion against the allocation of appropriate funding to the Sydney University. But that is very much the sort of risk that is in place, as a result of this discretionary, rather than committed, payment structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a real reflection on the philosophy of the government when approaching the year 2000 Olympics that it realises that it would have been electorally devastating to have contemplated reducing funding to sport. The electorate simply would not have tolerated that. The reality is we are, as a nation, involved in international competition every day and it is top class competition. We are facing the best of the best from all over the world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3972">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Countries in our region in particular are pumping considerable resources into developing their talent base and we are going backwards. Just because our economic development, our scientific development and our social development may not be included in the pages of the populist press does not mean that this government should regard what happens to ourselves as a nation, to our talent base, to our resource base and to our equitable and fair structure of society as being something that is not of fundamental and crucial importance. The whole thrust of this government has been towards perceived populist issues while getting stuck into those areas where it feels there will be a line of least resistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have come a long way since 1972 when the higher education system was opened up to all Australians. It is a sad day when we see those developments wound back. Unfortunately, on 20 August 1996 this government started building the gallows for the death of the clever country. I sincerely trust it will put the brakes on its efforts and have regard to the future needs of this great nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise to support the government's Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996. The honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) who preceded me has talked a bit about the history of higher education funding. He talked about the importance of it to individuals and I would like to expand on that theme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question in my mind and there is no question in the government's mind as to the importance of higher education to a nation such as Australia. We have, in the past 20 years, finally come to recognise that not only are universities important but also continuing secondary education is important for the vast bulk of our young people. We have recognised that in order to be able to compete well with other nations into the 21st century we need to have a well&hyphen;educated population. They need to be literate and they need to be numerate in order to be able to accept the challenges of the next century, in order to be able to participate fully in society and in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> order to be able to reach each person's individual potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Higher education, a further opportunity beyond compulsory and then free senior secondary education, is important to a nation. It is important to a nation because it establishes our ability to have a cultural identity. It produces thinkers. It produces artists. It produces engineers and builders. It produces legal minds. It helps produce our doctors, our researchers and those who look into the future for us. It produces economists and accountants. Higher education produces people of stature throughout society. These people contribute to the wealth and to the life of this nation. Higher education is important to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to industry, and when I say `industry' I say it in the context that industry also includes the government sector or the public sector of the economy as well as the private sector. It seems to me that one of the things that we have not found a good way of doing is involving to any substantive degree industry, which is a beneficiary of the outcomes of our universities, the outcomes of higher education. I think that is an issue that we need to address. It is an issue that I would like to see some of our strategic thinkers put some emphasis on and try to come to grips with: how we might go about more involving industry, which demonstrably benefits from the outcome of higher education. How can we involve it in this paradigm? How do we get it to help us fund our universities of excellence? It is a good question, and I am not sure that I have an answer for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third recipient of benefit from higher education is the individual. The member for Barton talked extensively about individual experience. The member for Barton said that he was a product of Whitlam's reforms in 1974 to the higher education system whereby the Australian people gave him a tertiary education. Do you know who paid for that? I will tell you who paid for it. Les Jones at the Berwick barber shop, who has been cutting my hair, even though it has been falling out, for the last 23 years, paid for the higher education of the member for Barton. He does not make much money cutting hair, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3973"> but he paid for it. The bloke that runs the street sweeper for the City of Berwick paid for it. The policemen who have luckily caught the young people who knocked my house over twice in two weeks recently did not have a higher education, but they paid for it.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="TANNER" NAMEID="YU5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did his parents pay taxes?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OT4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You know why? Because we all pay taxes, and the benefit to the private individual from tertiary education is immense. Certainly the greatest benefit of the three benefits that I have described goes to individuals. Individuals make a choice. No&hyphen;one tells you you have to go to university, do they? University is a choice, yet the Whitlam ideology, the Whitlam myth, was that every taxpayer in the nation should fund the education opportunities of the few. What a nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talk about privilege. There is no privileged class in society in Australia. It has long since been a myth that Australia had a class system. In a sense, when we were founded by our forefathers from Great Britain, they may have tried to bring a class system, but it did not work. It did not work because Australians would not let it work. So Australia has largely developed as a classless society, and thank goodness for that. With a full&hyphen;blown democracy, there is an opportunity for every individual to develop to their full potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> That is what higher education is all about, giving individuals the opportunity. Prior to Whitlam, the system was one of fees. The states did support some scholarships and the Commonwealth supported scholarships for deserving students, and those scholarships were not means tested. Whitlam brought in the theoretical concept of a free tertiary eduction. We could never afford that, and one of the reasons we could not afford it was that we kept denying access to thousands of Australian students who would have liked to have gone to university. Access and equity are always tied up together and they always will be. If we make it free and dependent on the public purse and there are limits to the public purse, there are limits to the number of students who can participate. If we deny students access, where is the equity? I main tain that under a free system there is no equity because there are limits on the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1989 John Dawkins realised that the Commonwealth government could no longer totally fund higher education, that there was a substantial benefit accruing to individuals as a result of their higher education studies and that they should participate in funding the universities and the professors, their teachers and their lecturers who provided that education to them. And so he brought in HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">HECS has been acclaimed around the world as a success. I applaud John Dawkins for that reform of the higher education system, because I always did believe that there was a place for students to contribute to their own education. HECS has worked fairly. In effect, HECS amounts to the students deferring income until later but not being charged interest on their contribution to that deferred income. It is a sort of modified student loan. It says that the students can borrow the money that universities need in contribution from them and pay it back when they have full working jobs, but it does not operate like the system in the United States, where students are required to take out commercial loans with full interest rates and all the attendant risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand also that the loan system in the United States means that students pay back their loan the day they leave university, not when they reach a particular income level. HECS works so that you start paying back the income through the taxation system, without interest but in real dollars, when you reach a minimum income level. For some time, many people have thought that that income level was relatively high, considering how many Australians are on lower incomes and battling to feed families and children and take care of themselves under constrained economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Dawkins brought in HECS. In 1996 we see a few changed circumstances with respect to the tertiary education sector. Operating grants will be reduced in this financial year only very marginally, and every vice&hyphen;chancellor acknowledges that the reduction is only marginal. It is not even enough to say that it is a real efficiency dividend.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3974">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some vice&hyphen;chancellors have argued that they owe their professors a pay increase, but because of tenure many are caught in a trap where they have many employees on university campuses who may not be contributing to the overall benefit of the university. About that there is little they can do until we change the industrial relations system, until we modify it so that universities can negotiate as individual universities with their staff. Even as I speak, we are trying to pass a bill, which is before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Operating grants have been cut only marginally, in what really amounts to a very small efficiency dividend, and the further reduction in forward estimate years is only a minimal efficiency dividend. But, unless we are going to increase taxes to Australians and make more working Australians pay for tertiary education for those who are privileged to have the opportunity to study, we need to find savings in education because it is a very big spending budget. So the government is bringing in differential HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Differential HECS makes an awful lot of sense to me. That is to say, in those courses which have the potential to generate the highest income, and which are very popular, students should differentially pay more. Certainly, it seems silly to request a student who is studying a general arts degree, and whose course costs much less to provide, to pay the same amount of fee as is charged of a student in a course to become a doctor, whose income potential is huge, or a lawyer, whose income potential is almost limitless. Differential HECS is fair. It makes sense. It is equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to paying the HECS debt earlier, I said before that the Commonwealth will now require a HECS debt which has been incurred to be paid when the student reaches a modest income level of something over $20,000. It is only fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with pleasure that the minister has proposed to bring in a substantial number of Commonwealth scholarships. This helps bring equity into the debate as well. All students, as long as they have applied themselves at secondary school and as long as they have the potential to benefit from tertiary education, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should have the opportunity. The income level should not deter them. That is why we have this full-blown Austudy system and that is why we use HECS: so that no&hyphen;one need be deterred from university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Barton talked about how wonderful it was that my Les Jones from Berwick barber shop paid for his education. I can tell you that nobody paid for mine. I had to pay fees and I had to pay for living expenses. I had to work while I was in university in order to pay those outgoings because I considered that my education was deferred income. I considered that those four years that I gave up at university meant that I was going to earn in later years the income that I would have earned at that time. In fact, that did occur. It did occur. I was willing to work to help support my tertiary studies. I commend that as an option to many Australian students. I think that we need to help change the attitudes of some employers. Certainly, the changes that we propose to make to the industrial relations system should make it easier for tertiary students to find regular part&hyphen;time work which will help them support themselves during their university courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note also with pleasure that the Commonwealth is increasing funding for research in universities. That will be to the benefit of our tertiary sector and it will be to the benefit of quite a number of students who wish to continue on after their undergraduate days to do further research and further study. In my mind, this bill represents a fair and equitable application of rules and regulations surrounding how we fund tertiary studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take a few moments of the House's time to talk about a local experience. I only have one university in the electorate of La Trobe. We fought long and hard for the Berwick campus of Monash. This year in January, I am delighted to note to the House, Berwick campus of Monash opened its doors. It is an absolutely exceptional institution, with its modern campus facility. It is so because it is located directly across the road from a brand new, modern TAFE facility. It is within three minutes walking distance from a rail station, on a major rail line leading out of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3975"> Melbourne. It is located exactly on on/off ramps on a major freeway leading through the south&hyphen;east of Melbourne and down to the La Trobe valley. It is on 150 acres of beautiful land in the heart of a lovely village in a country setting with many trees leading up to the hills and the Dandenong Ranges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That area, which is the fastest growing region of Victoria, is also one of the fastest growing regions in all of Australia. Recent statistics put it, in terms of total growth per year of population, as something like the second fastest growing region in all of the country. But at the same time it has the lowest participation rate in tertiary studies of any area in Victoria. Victoria has the highest participation rate in the country. Why? Not because of Commonwealth funding but because for many long years Victorians supported tertiary education, paid the money to build Victorian universities and Victorians wanted to support higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing about the area that I represent and where our little campus is located is that it is not only the area of the lowest participation rate but also an area of extremely high demand. That is because we did not have facilities there and it was so difficult to travel. Frequently&mdash;all too frequently&mdash;travel had to be by car to get to a university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened is that last September when applications closed at the Berwick campus of Monash University there were 6,307 applications for 100 Commonwealth funded places. That is incredible. Talk about unmet demand. There was absolutely staggering demand. There were 6,307 applications for 100 Commonwealth funded places. We are a bit starved for capital, I can tell you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All kinds of students want to come to this new facility. The facility is offering degrees in business, in communications and in tourism and many of the programs are now jointly running with the TAFE across Clyde Road. It is a terrific, new, cooperative approach to tertiary education. It is an exciting new venture and many people around the world are looking at the new, modern facility. In particular, they are looking at how the communications course is being taught and what it offers the students in the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the year 2000 we will need that campus to have 2,000 full-time places in order to make it a really viable tertiary institution. In order to do that we need another building. I have asked the minister for the Commonwealth to provide seed funding for a new university of another $10 million which will be more than matched by Monash itself from its own internal funds and by a few more student places which Monash will transfer from other of its campuses in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We expect overseas students to take advantage of this new facility and we expect ultimately that some students who are above the Commonwealth cut&hyphen;off for places may decide to fund their own places at the Berwick campus of Monash to continue with their tertiary studies. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak today on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996, although in some respects one could ask why the government has bothered to proceed with this bill given the substantial changes it has made to the effects of this bill in its budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill varies the amounts payable to higher education institutions by way of operating grants and other expenses for the period 1996&hyphen;1998 and this reflects the triennium funding period that the previous government put into place. This bill mirrors the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995, which lapsed as a result of the election. The bill followed the pattern of previous years in specifying maximum grant amounts. The government can provide, under the legislation, less than those amounts and this government seems to be about to create a precedent in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains other technical measures, and I suppose it is for that reason the government is pursuing this particular bill, even though in substantive terms the budget overtakes the funding arrangements. The bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, which is the principal act under which higher education operates and under which the previous government's higher education policies were implemented.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3976">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commonwealth expenditure on higher education has been increasing steadily over recent years and operating grants for higher education institutions are estimated to total just over $4.9 billion in 1996. Under the forecasts, before being disturbed by the current budget, it was to be $4.9 billion in 1997 and just over $5 billion in 1998. Of course, that has all been changed by the government's measures announced on 9 August in the run&hyphen;up to the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Education goes to a very substantive and important part of our community and our nation. When I think in terms of my own life, I think how fortunate I have been. My mother and father came from a lower middle income part of society, and they worked hard to give me the benefit of a good education and the opportunity that that provides. I happen to be the youngest of three children and, because I was the youngest, in educational terms I was more fortunate than my two older sisters, one of whom did not complete secondary school and one of whom did complete secondary school and subsequently qualified at the university level at a later stage in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I was able to go to university was, in addition to the hard work of my mother and father, that I happen to be one of the generation who took advantage of the Whitlam government's education policies. But for the abolition of university fees in my time, I would not have been able to attend university. So I have a long&hyphen;held view that the Commonwealth government has a responsibility to provide a top quality education for our young people and children. That means substantive and adequate funding. It means better schools. It means education at the higher level, which is relevant to the opportunities of the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government's efforts and record on higher education, over a sustained period of time, to ensure that secondary school retention rates were massively increased over the period of the 1980s and 1990s&mdash;from about 30 per cent in the early 1980s to upward of 70 per cent in recent years&mdash;show that there has been a massive investment on this side of the House, so far as education is concerned. When I go to areas <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of my electorate in Perth, to suburbs like Midland and Midvale, Bassendean, Bayswater and North Perth, I find that one of the things that very many parents pride themselves on is the fact that their children have had secondary school and tertiary education opportunities far greater than they have had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very regrettable thing about the actions of this government relates to the promises with which it went to the election in March this year. In its formal election commitment the coalition promised, firstly, in respect of operating grants:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition . . . will at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, in terms of young people's capacity to attend university via HECS, it promised, again to quote formally from its election commitment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition consistently has opposed changes to HECS rules after a student has begun study and will maintain this position in government.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come to the detail in due course, but subsequent events have shown that the promise of the coalition to maintain Commonwealth funding for universities in terms of operating grants has been blatantly broken, with the cutting of over $623.6 million in operating grants over a four&hyphen;year period and, so far as the HECS commitment is concerned, the significant lowering of the HECS repayments threshold and an increase in the rate of repayment for existing HECS students and graduates. So the substantial reduction in the amount of Commonwealth funds going to our tertiary institutions is in the context of two blatant breaches of the coalition's election undertakings and commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3977"> I will now deal with some of those changes in more detail. So far as cuts to the university operating grants and discretionary funds are concerned, the announcements made by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, on 9 August, were done deliberately&mdash;in political terms&mdash;to get some bad news out of the way before a subsequent attempt at a slick presentation of the budget. In the announcement of 9 August, which was subsequently incorporated in the budget, cuts to the university operat ing grants were of the order of $623 million and increases in HECS charges were changes that will produce savings of $313 million and $817 million over the forward estimates period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as other changes were concerned, the announcement on 9 August also had the effect that this government will allow universities to introduce up&hyphen;front fees for Australian graduates. The government has said that it will allow universities to offset the cuts in public funding by permitting them to charge fees to Australian graduates for places additional to their Commonwealth funded load. The introduction of up&hyphen;front fees was something which the previous government strenuously opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other pernicious changes which drives the bottom line was the raising of the age of independence for Austudy. The previous government introduced measures in 1992 to progressively reduce the age of independence from 25 to 22. That has been reversed; but, worse, it has been reversed in a sense in a retrospective way. The effect will be that students who turn 25 during their course will continue to be deemed to be dependent upon completion. That is a brief summary of some of the more pernicious elements of the government's higher education policy released on 9 August and incorporated in the budget. Some of those deserve to be dealt with in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the efforts that the previous government made was to do its best to ensure that higher education became accessible to a greater number of young people. Having successfully, massively and substantially increased the secondary retention rates, the effort was there to ensure that the opportunity of tertiary education was made available to many more people. Under the previous government, enrolments grew from around 350,000 in 1983 to about 630,000 at the beginning of this year. That effort, of course, will now be substantially diminished, because it is quite clear that the cuts to operating expenses will have the effect of reducing the number of tertiary places available. That will have a particularly pernicious impact in the outlying growth states like my own state of Western Australia and Queensland and in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regions generally in New South Wales&mdash;like, for example, western Sydney. The newer institutions and proposed institutions in those regional areas will suffer greatly. Proposed new institutions will not get off the ground and existing institutions in the regional areas will find it massively difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes have of course been described as just a `nick' by the minister for education. $623 million out of operating expenses is a massive slug on the universities and on the opportunity of young people, particularly those from low and middle income families, to have a tertiary education. Over 90 per cent of Commonwealth funding for universities comes from the operating grants and reducing $623 million out of 90 per cent of the overall funding is a massive, massive slug. That is, of course, in addition to the $214&hyphen;odd million cut from the discretionary funds which the universities have. It is fair to point out that the coalition indicated in the run&hyphen;up to the election that it would do precisely that in removing the $214 million from the discretionary funds, but it made it quite clear that it would maintain, at least in real terms, the amount of operating grants. What it has also done in addition to the reduction in operating grants is to fail to provide supplementation for any academic staff salary increases, requiring the universities to make those payments out of their substantially reduced operating finances. That will have further adverse effects on the number of places and the capacity of young Australians to have the opportunity of tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To deal briefly with some of the aspects of HECS changes and up&hyphen;front fees, there are three areas to which attention needs to be drawn which have the effect of making it much more difficult for students or young people or families from low and middle income areas to have the opportunity of attending university. The coalition proposes to substantially raise the HECS contribution of all new students. The current single rate of HECS is at $2,242. That will be replaced by a three&hyphen;tier structure which starts at $3,300 and concludes at $5,500.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3978">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second change is to lower the threshold at which HECS becomes repayable. The third change is to allow universities to charge full fees for places over and above the Commonwealth targeted amount. It is clear that those changes will have the effect of making it harder for Australians from low and middle income areas to have the opportunity of access to a university education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made the point that some of these changes will have the effect of making it very difficult for universities in outlying or regional areas either to develop new institutions or places or to even retain existing institutions or places. In my own electorate of Perth, the local community of Midland&mdash;in particular, the shire of Swan&mdash;and its local, state and federal members have been working very hard over some time to establish a university campus at Midland at the site of the old Westrail railway workshops. It is quite clearly the case that the government's decisions have effectively ended the prospects of a Midland university in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can examine and analyse the education places in Western Australia. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> did this and reported that, on its assessment of the reduction of the operating grants, places in Western Australia would be reduced by over 1,000. A reduction in places and a reduction in operating grants has an effect on universities like Edith Cowan University and Curtin University. At various times both universities&mdash;and now, in particular, Edith Cowan University&mdash;have had an interest in establishing a university in Midland. The prospects of that occurring are now remote, if not zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the changes that the coalition has made are reflected in the reports on these particular measures. The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) referred to his own education, and I assume he was speaking about an education in the United States, but I will stand corrected. The first newspaper clipping I draw attention to has the headline `University fees higher than US'. The member for La Trobe was lauding his own experience. What he actually wants for Australia is an education system like that of the United States, which has up-front fees only the rich are able to pay.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The headlines continue: `Universities to slash 6,700 places'. Again, that limits the opportunity for young Australians to get a tertiary education. `Law academics warn uni fees will favour elite'. Being a proud graduate of the law school at the University of Western Australia, I found that one of the advantages of the Whitlam government's policies in the 1970s was that they broadened the range and diversity of those people who studied law. It is quite clear that that sort of education will run the risk of becoming a more elite preserve than it is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another clipping has the headline `Uni costs will hurt the poor, warns professor'. Absolutely right. `Fees to change student profile', because the students will be coming from richer families. `University spots to drop in 1998', which is the reference I made on the effect in Western Australia. That articles states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WA public universities will offer 75 fewer Government-funded places in 1998 . . . and more than 1000 fewer than were promised by the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA>That will have a significant adverse effect on Western Australians&mdash;and, in particular, on those young Western Australians who come from my own electorate of Perth, with the opportunity for a university at Midland now being substantially reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the fine print, you find that what the government is doing in this area is precisely what it is doing in government generally. Education costs are up. HECS has increased. Austudy has been cut. University, school and TAFE funding has been slashed. Assistance for students with disabilities has stopped altogether. This rings consistent with what the government is doing in other areas, such as health, where it has cut $800 million to hospital funding and where age care costs are up, prescription costs are up, child-care costs are up and dental care costs are up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could not find a better illustration of the changes that have occurred in this area than the article which appeared on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on Saturday, 10 August. It said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, have you seen the report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  where the author of the NILS study, which you refused to table on Monday, Professor Wootten, states that, first, contrary to your assertion the projected rate of eight per cent of unemployment was not based on continuation of Labor policies? He says, `There is nothing in our model that is based on Labor policies.' Secondly, it asserts his view that there is nothing in your industrial relations bill which will `do anything in his view for unemployment'. Doesn't the report confirm that it is your policies, not ours, that leave unemployment at eight per cent? Are you comfortable and relaxed about an eight per cent unemployment rate for the next four years? Will you now table that report, together with the departmental advice to your government, that Labor was on track for five per cent?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is no. As to the generality of the question, I think when we are talking about predictions about unemployment we ought to bear in mind a piece of advice that was given on this subject, and I would like to read it out. This piece of advice was given in 1993 and reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our commitment, as a government and as a nation, should not be to any arbitrary unemployment number or rate. Our commitment must be to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reduction of unemployment as rapidly and as completely as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say that is quite a sound statement of principle with which I would agree. I am very happy to inform the House that they were the words of the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Kim Beazley, when addressing the National Press Club on 30 June 1993.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given the discrimination practiced by the previous Labor government against single income families, can the Prime Minister advise the House what steps the government is taking to address this situation? If so, will this action also promote freedom of choice for parents in relation to how they organise their arrangements in the important task of raising children?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3980" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is particularly proud of the family tax initiative and it is proud of that initiative for two major reasons. The first and most important reason is that it emphatically endorses a very fundamental principle of the Liberal and National parties, and that is that we ought to give greater choice to Australian parents about the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> caring arrangements for their young children. We are for choice; we are not for dictating the caring arrangements that ought to exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The taxation system of this country has long discriminated against those people in the community who provide child care by the method of one or other of the parents of young children remaining part time or full time out of the work force whilst those children are young. In no way does this initiative seek to dictate choice. What it seeks to do is to facilitate choice by shifting some of the taxation burden away from single-income families. I am particularly proud of a government that has introduced such a measure. The family tax initiative also provides a generality of taxation relief for all Australian families with children who have incomes of up to $70,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is a measure which is designed to give greater taxation justice to Australians with young children. It is decidedly a pro-family initiative. It is an initiative that attracted a great deal of support in the last election campaign. By reason of that part of the initiative which provides for an increase in the tax-free threshold for families with incomes of under $65,000 a year, which are single-income families which have one child under five years, it does endorse that great principle of choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I notice that some of the criticism that has been made of the initiative suggests that, in some way, it is seeking to discriminate against one or other of the choices that are made by parents as to the caring arrangements for their children. I want to say on behalf of the government that that is neither the intent nor the effect of the measure. What the measure does is to give greater choice to Australians&mdash;parents who are raising young children. We do not say, `You ought to have the children in child care.' We do not say to the mother or father, `One of you ought to be at home.' What we say is that we will give you the maximum possible choice that any responsible government can do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The symbolism of this measure as well as the real benefits, which amount to $4 billion over four years, the recognition of choice&mdash;the recognition that the system up to now has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3981"> unfairly penalised single-income families and has, in effect, made second-class parents of those who decide that one or other of the parents ought to remain at home when the children are very young&mdash;and the reality of the assistance under the measure have been widely applauded by the battling families of Australia. It is one of the reasons why the battling families of Australia rejected the Australian Labor Party so emphatically on 2 March.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<ANSWER PAGE="3981" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. I will be tabling in the Senate later today the findings of the Brew report, which I am required to do under a Senate motion moved yesterday. The Brew report was a report that I commissioned because of concerns raised by the Chairman of the Australian National Railways Commission, Mr Jack Smorgan, who, shortly after we came into office, came to me and said that he had very serious concerns about AN's financial position. As a consequence of that we decided that a report was necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3982">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the House will recall that the previous government had indicated that the AN Railways Commission would be making a loss of some $26 million during the last financial year. I can inform the House that the Brew report has highlighted some very serious concerns about AN's financial position that would confirm the concerns of the chairman, Mr Smorgan, and many other people in the railway community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report highlights that AN has debts and liabilities in excess of $1,000 million. The Brew report also highlights that AN made a loss in financial year 1995-96 not of $26 million as claimed by the previous government but of between $135 million and $148 million&mdash;substantial greater than had been the case reported by the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brew report also highlights that the government subsidy required for each employee at AN per year is currently running at $30,000. The Brew report also highlights that, unless we do something to remedy the problem, by the year 2000 or 2001 the government subsidy required per employee at AN will be in the order of $220,000 per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This highlights the very serious financial circumstances that AN was left in after 13 years of Labor government. The Brew report also highlights that the seeds of destruction of AN were sown by the former government in the manner in which it established the National Railway Corporation. In the process of establishing it, Labor took the best routes from AN and gave them to NR and also took locomotives and rolling stock from AN and provided them to NR without adequate compensation, leaving AN with a smaller revenue base but the same debt and commitments that it had to meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the report highlights&mdash;the way the Labor government set up NR ensured that, if AN were to have any hope of being a viable business in the future, it was destroyed by the decision of the Labor government in 1991-92. It also highlights that the former Labor government knew precisely how badly off AN was. It knew exactly what was going on there&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Speaker, you would be aware that on television last night a number of serious allegations were made about R&amp;D syndication. Let me make it entirely clear that this was a government that was aware of problems in relation to R&amp;D syndication and this was a government prepared to act against it. This was a government prepared to act against tax avoidance, unlike the Australian Labor Party, as you have seen, which is extremely sensitive about its record on tax avoidance&mdash;a position which it maintains to this day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3985"> On 23 July, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and I announced the government's decision to close off new syndicates qualifying for R&amp;D tax concessions. We had been concerned about the growing evidence that the program was being continually exploited by finance promoters for tax minimisation purposes. Typically, syndica tion arrangements provided significant taxation benefits for investors but limited direct assistance to researchers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Syndicate arrangements approved by the IR&amp;D board show that on average the government was paying in excess of $2 for every $1 of R&amp;D expenditure. Examples were provided to us where researchers had sold core technology for $1,000, and then on&hyphen;sold three days later for $14 million into syndicates where the full R&amp;D tax concession was claimed. Other examples have been provided where $8.76 million of tax benefits were provided but ensuring only $4.16 million went on new R&amp;D activities&mdash;a Commonwealth subsidy through the tax system of $2.10 for each new dollar on R&amp;D.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I am very aware of the reports that have been in the press and on television last night related to the administration of the R&amp;D syndicated program. As a result of this, I have today announced that I will be establishing an independent inquiry to report to me on the facts of these matters by the end of October. I must also say that Mr John Bertrand, who is the founder of the Southern Cross syndicate, has written to me supporting the need for such an inquiry. Mr Bertrand has offered to stand aside as Chairman of the Industry Research and Development Board for the duration of the inquiry&mdash;and I totally agree with his stand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a more general point, as the Treasurer has pointed out, on 23 July the Treasurer and I made a press statement at that point ending the syndicated program. As a result of that decision, that program came to an end. The government chose this path principally because we had concerns that the syndication program had become focused more on financial outcomes rather than research and development outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3987"> I could, and should, point out a couple of examples of how these syndicates worked. Not only does the Treasurer very rightly point out the case where $1,000 worth of core technology became $14 million; but also I mentioned on Monday, in response to a ques tion, where an expenditure of $12.6 million in terms of tax deductions ended up an investment for research and development of some $5.6 million. In another case, core technology which was sold through a chain of different tax havens at inflated prices was eventually brought back to Australia at $70 million. At that point, the tax deductions were applicable within this country, but any commercialisation of the tax benefit would be lost to Australia, as all income would be credited outside this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation surrounding the rorting of syndication was well known in financial circles in Sydney and Melbourne. If it was well known there, how come the government of the day did not know? More importantly, how come any prudent minister was not aware that such speculation was around? However, in typical fashion, the government did not do a thing about it&mdash;and the maladministration of the rorts that went on will live with you forever.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question and acknowledge her interest in issues such as nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The passage of the Australian sponsored resolution putting on the table the comprehensive test ban treaty has been a milestone in global efforts to advance nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. I do not think it is going too far to say that this will bring nuclear testing to an end. Not only have all five nuclear weapon states supported the Australian resolution, but all five nuclear weapon states have agreed to sign the comprehensive test ban treaty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it could be argued that it will take some years for this treaty to meet the formal entry into forced provisions, the simple fact is that, once countries have signed up to the treaty, even if it has not entered into force, they have made a moral commitment to that treaty and it would be unlikely in the extreme for a country to abrogate the undertaking it had made by signing up to the treaty. With the chemical weapons convention, which finally was laid on the table for signature in 1993, many countries have signed that treaty&mdash;so far, not quite enough for it to meet its entry into forced provisions. But those who have signed have absolutely adhered to the provisions of the convention, and I believe that precisely the same thing will occur with the comprehensive test ban treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as Australia is concerned, obviously we are delighted to have played a constructive role in ensuring that the treaty could be open for signature. This is an issue&mdash;this issue of nuclear test ban treaties&mdash;that Australia has been involved in for many years, certainly since the 1970s. I acknowledge that it is an issue that both sides of politics have participated actively in. It is fair to say that my predecessor, the now member for Holt, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3988"> worked very hard on the issue of the text of the comprehensive test ban treaty, and his predecessor too&mdash;and so it goes back somewhat. I am glad that Australia has been able to continue a tradition by taking this constructive initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, it is very heartening that 158 governments have supported the Australian resolution; unfortunately, three have opposed it&mdash;but only three have opposed it. Of course, we regret that three countries have opposed the resolution, but I want to make this point about India in particular. We have a very close bilateral relationship with India, and this government is strongly committed to enhancing that relationship with India. We are spending something like $6 million on the New Horizons promotion program in India in October&hyphen;November this year to give Australia a much higher profile in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So our commitment to developing the bilateral relationship is a very strong one and we will not allow our differences over nuclear test ban issues to stand in the way of that bilateral relationship. I want to make it absolutely clear that we will quarantine our differences on the issue of the comprehensive test ban treaty from the overall bilateral relationship. I am confident that that is a view that is entirely reciprocated by the Indian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as this Australian initiative is concerned, I think it has been enormously constructive in bringing into existence the comprehensive test ban treaty for signature. I think it is regrettable that three countries voted against our resolution but, nevertheless, I do not think that it will affect our bilateral relationship with India in substance.</PARA></ANSWER>

At the time, when Labor was in power, the Australian Federal Police had earlier closed their investigation into this matter, but the Australian Federal Police Commissioner has now advised the new government that in view of the court's judgment the AFP is currently reviewing the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry was initiated by an application under the Industrial Relations Act by one of the candidates in the 1994 election. In essence, the application alleged that people had solicited blank ballot papers from members of the union and had then used those papers to cast a vote in the election. The court found that there had been a number of irregularities, the most serious of which amounted to widespread electoral fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That electoral fraud consisted of multiple voting by a limited number of persons. The court found that members of the union had been approached by other members to hand over their uncompleted ballot papers, which had then been completed by a limited number of other persons, and some ballot papers may have been intercepted before reaching the intended recipients. In all, some 930 ballot papers were tampered with in this fraudulent election.</PARA>

What measures are there in the budget to address these challenges?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3991" SPEAKER="Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP" NAMEID="8E4" ELECTORATE="Chisholm" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Health and Family Services" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Medicare does face a number of challenges and, in the words of the previous Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Brian Howe, if you do not reform Medicare, it dies. In the budget we have made reforms in five areas relating to the supply of medical practitioners, the capping of pathology fees, addressing rorts, addressing issues in rural health and addressing issues in general practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably the most significant change that has been made in the budget is to actually address the supply of medical practitioners. Health is an area that is substantially supply driven and, again in the words of Brian Howe, the unrestricted access into general practice was a time bomb waiting to destroy Medicare. What we have done is to limit to 400 a year the number of new entrants going into general practice. We hope this will do something to alleviate the oversupply of about 4,500 general practitioners working in metropolitan areas, each one of them adding <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3992"> approximately $180,000 per year to the total Medicare budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area where we have instituted reform is in the capping of pathology fees. This is significant because it is the first time ever that an item of expenditure has been formally capped under Medicare. We have done this with the cooperation of the Australian association of pathology providers and the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing we have done is address a number of longstanding rorts that should have been addressed some time ago. We have addressed the system whereby on Medicare there was unlimited psychoanalysis. I can give honourable members one example of a practitioner who is affectionately known as the jumbo jet. He billed 747 75-minute consultations in one 12-month period. We will be limiting this to 50 consultations a year. I can assure the shadow Treasurer that relevance deprivation syndrome will still be covered. We are also addressing the issue of doctor shopping, whereby a small number of patients can go to a very large number of medical practitioners. They are usually people with a drug habit or looking for access to pharmaceuticals to export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth area where we have instituted reform is in the area of rural health. We have provided $27 million over four years to set up six departments of rural health. I hope that in the future these will have the same significance that the departments of community medicine have clearly had over the last 24 years. I have signed off on the first two of these which will start on 1 January 1997. One will be at Broken Hill and be jointly run by the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales; the other will be at Mount Isa and will be sponsored by the University of Queensland and James Cook University.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also delivered on the commitment by the Deputy Prime Minister to institute John Flynn scholarships. We hope there will be up to 150 of these a year tenable for up to four years. These have been provided for in the budget. We are also providing additional resources to give rural general practitioners access to locums.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made one of the most significant changes in the area of general practice. General practice will no longer be the dumping ground for medicine. Doctors will have to be fully qualified in general practice before entering general practice. This will increase the standards of general practice and will protect the public through standards that will guarantee the quality of the general practitioner they are seeing. We have reversed our decision to make substantial savings in the better practice program, but we will be changing that so that it actually measures better practice and not an index of patient loyalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I can tell honourable members that the coordinated care trials are progressing&mdash;they had stalled on our coming to government&mdash;and we are doing it with the full cooperation of divisions of general practice. We have budgeted for $20 million next year for this. Today I signed an agreement with the South Australian Minister for Health to have the Care Plus trial go ahead. This is the largest of the coordinated care trials that will cover 8,000 people. The Commonwealth is putting in $1.7 million; the South Australian government, $600,000. Together these will lay the foundation for the long-term viability of Medicare and address some of the issues that have been lying around for years waiting to be addressed.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Herbert for giving me the opportunity to comment on some matters that have occurred in the other place today dealing with the assurance of support scheme. The assurance of support scheme, as honourable members would be aware, is the system by which nominators of family migrants accept the responsibility for payment and maintenance of their relatives when they come to Australia, ensuring that they do not become a charge upon the welfare system. It is a system that has long been in place, one which had some degree of efficacy, but over time, under the former government, it was allowed to sink into a situation where its efficacy was severely challenged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major difficulties that we have with it is that&mdash;the arrangements between the Department of Social Security and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs being to clearly identify payments that are made to people in the period in which there is a preclusion properly identified, that the amounts that are repayable are properly identified and that those who have accepted the obligation to support their relatives when they first arrive are made to accept that obligation and to repay any benefits that are paid to their relatives&mdash;we sought to put in place simple amendments to ensure that that system would be able to undertake that important task. The regulations to do that have been disallowed today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret very much that that has happened, because it is based upon an assumption that we were trying to do something more than maintain a system that has been in place over a long period of time. It is based upon misconceptions about parliamentary responsibility and accountability, because the Labor <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3998"> Party itself on many occasions used the same system that we wanted to put in place&mdash;that is, a system which provided by way of regulation for gazettal notice to be used for minor changes when they occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to redress this issue, and it is important to redress it in this context. When the Labor Party were in office they allowed a situation to arise where the assurance of support scheme, according to Senator Richardson in 1991, had something in the order of $32 million outstanding from assurances that had been given by relatives. When the government then sought to recover that amount as a debt, they found they were able to recover only $1.77 million. When they actually sought to recover the debt, they were able to get only a proportion of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major reasons why this occurred was that the former government changed the names of benefits, and of course the assurance system did not enable those particular debts then to be recovered. We want to put in place an assurance of support system that will be able to achieve that objective. It is very disappointing that the Labor Party, who were offered cooperation by us to ensure that the system was able to undertake its task properly, are prepared to disallow important provisions of this sort that will enable the system to work. I hope they will reconsider their position on the matter.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some parliamentary committees&mdash;an example would be the corporations and securities committee&mdash;have employed the standing practice that when investigations were being carried out by organisations, such as the Australian Securities Commission, that had a direct relevance to that committee, the committee would choose not to carry out such an investigation. That actually came at the behest of the right honourable member for New England.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Speaker, would you examine the standing orders of this place and the practice that applies to House of Representatives and joint parliamentary committees to see whether or not such a practice is, in fact, reasonable and warranted and would deliver an appropriate outcome in the circumstances?</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Some four weeks ago, it was my privilege to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lead a representative group of Vietnam veterans to Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia. This visit was part of the government's Australia Remembers Vietnam 1962&hyphen;1973 commemorative program. It was but one of several activities held last month to mark Vietnam Veterans' Day&mdash;18 August. That is the day that we all recall Australia's involvement in the Vietnam conflict and the courage, commitment and sacrifice of the 59,000 Australians who had a role to play in it. In particular, it is a time to remember the 508 Australians who, in the course of the Vietnam conflict, gave their lives in the service of their country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was particularly significant that, in commemorating our involvement in Vietnam, we were able to take a representative group of Vietnam veterans back to Vietnam. It enabled the veterans to confront and understand many of the memories that have been with them and their families for the last 30 years. It was an opportunity for them to see the beauty of the country and the warmth of the people, when mostly they could remember only the ugliness and the horror of war. And now those who were part of the delegation have had the opportunity to share that experience&mdash;a profoundly healing one&mdash;with their families, friends and fellow veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was an honour and a privilege for me to be in the company of 30 such fine Australians. Their remarkable good humour, support for one another and pride in their country was a true highlight of the visit. I would like to report to members of the House some of the significant events of the visit and then outline what I believe are the major benefits that will come to all Australians as a result of this visit. It was an experience which deserves to be shared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, may I express my appreciation to my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Alexander Downer. His personal efforts and representations to the Vietnamese government were critical to the visit's success. I would also like to record my thanks to Australia's Ambassador to Vietnam, Her Excellency Ms Sue Boyd, the staff of the Australian embassy in Hanoi and the Australian Consulate&hyphen;General in Ho Chi Minh City. Without their unflagging efforts, the visit <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4001"> would not have been the outstanding success that, ultimately, it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must also say how much the Australian government has appreciated the assistance and cooperation of the government of Vietnam and the people's committees in the provinces we visited in making the tour program possible. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam more than 20 years ago, the relationship between our two countries has continued to grow from strength to strength. We in this nation value this relationship very much, and I am sure that visits such as these can only add to that strength. I understand that the Vietnamese government was very satisfied with the way in which the veterans' visit proceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are grateful, too, to the high commissioners of Malaysia and Singapore and their staff for the assistance they provided to the delegation while we were visiting those countries. The assistance provided by the governments of Malaysia and Singapore was also very much appreciated by the members of the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit program, which began on 11 August, involved 27 Vietnam veterans, two widows of Vietnam veterans and a descendant of a serviceman killed in Vietnam. These 30 people were randomly selected to represent the more than 59,000 Australians who served in Vietnam. All three arms of the services were represented, as well as philanthropic organisations and official entertainers who had served in Vietnam. All states and the two territories of Australia were represented in the group. The shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), was also part of the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first major commemorative activity in the tour was a ceremony at the Terendak Military Cemetery in Malaysia. It is here that 24 Australian servicemen killed in Vietnam are buried, including Major Peter Badcoe VC, whose widow, Mrs Denise Clark, was one of the veteran party. As the prologue in the order of service noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The graves here have not been kept separate from others in the cemetery. They have not been put to one side as though they did not belong, but neither <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have they been held up as heroes. Though it is called a military cemetery, it is very much a community cemetery. There are children here and wives. There are young soldiers and older ones. In one way, this is as it should be. Our veterans, taken by circumstance and duty from us, have in death been returned to the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA>In a moving and, for some, a very emotional ceremony we recalled the sacrifice made by all those Australians who died in Vietnam. The Australian serviceman or woman draws on a proud tradition stretching back nearly 100 years. The hallmarks across the years have been dedication, a pride in their work, a seriousness of purpose and a sense of achievement. In Vietnam that tradition was carried on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore, our second commemorative service recalled all who had served in Vietnam. After the laying of wreaths, we moved a short distance to the Kranji Military Cemetery where the first Australian serviceman to be killed in action in Vietnam is buried. Warrant Officer Kevin Conway was a member of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. He was killed in July 1964 when the Special Forces outpost of Nam Dong was attacked by enemy forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But these activities, important though they were, were in many ways a prelude to the group's arrival in Vietnam. As we arrived in Vietnam and throughout the duration of the visit, we were greeted with genuine warmth and friendship. From the Vice Minister for Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs, Mr Nguyen Van Quang, to the Vice President of the Ho Chi Minh City War Veterans Association, Major General Nguyen Van Si, right through to the humblest of the village folk, the welcome was always the same&mdash;warm and friendly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my calls on Vice Minister Quang and Major General Si, I was able to stress that this visit by the delegation of veterans demonstrated the sincerity of Australia's commitment to Vietnam. They stressed that the Australian level of commitment was reciprocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Dong Nai museum in Bien Hoa, we were privileged to see the original Long Tan cross erected by Australians after the Battle of Long Tan, which was fought on 18 August <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4002"> 1966. In that battle, D Company of 6th Royal Australian Regiment held off a numerically superior enemy force. Eighteen Australians lost their lives in the battle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Possibly the most poignant moments of the visit came when the group reached the Long Tan battlefield itself. In August 1966, when the battle raged, it was a rubber plantation. Today the area is a cornfield. Nevertheless, the Long Tan cross site is still preserved in the middle of the field. A replica of the original cross has been made and erected in the original location.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The site itself is in good repair and clearly regarded with respect as there is an undisturbed area around the site which has not been ploughed up. It is obvious that the villagers of Long Tan care for the site which means so much to Australians. The cross itself is believed to be located at the point where Jim Richmond, another member of our party, was found wounded the day after the Battle of Long Tan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 18 August, Vietnam Veterans Day, we were joined by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, the Hon. Tim Fischer, for a ceremony at Nui Dat. This would be the first time an Australian government group would hold a commemorative ceremony in Vietnam. The Deputy Prime Minister's address highlighted the cost to both sides in the war. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inevitably, of course, we remember the heroism of our friends and comrades. But we also acknowledge the courage of those Vietnamese against whom we fought. In the years since the war, many of us have come to know our former opponents as friends and so it is natural that, at a service such as this, we honour the Vietnamese fallen.</PARA>
<PARA>The veterans then joined the Deputy Prime Minister and many local officials and veterans for the unveiling of a plaque by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, at the site of the Ba Ria Australian Vietnam Veterans Reconstruction Group Orphans and Disabled Children's Centre. The Australian Vietnam veterans reconstruction group led by their president, Paul Murphy, is making a very positive contribution to the development of important infrastructure in the Ba Ria Vung Tau province.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This centre will provide the necessary facilities to care for many of the district's less fortunate children. Funding for the project comes from Australian Vietnam veterans reconstruction group members themselves with a contribution from the Australian government. Australian companies in Vietnam have also been able to contribute to this project through the provision of building materials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This project is an important one giving, as it does, hope to those children in the Ba Ria Vung Tau province who will use its facilities. In any country, Vietnam as well as Australia, children are the future and anything that we can do to ensure that they are given every opportunity to develop their potential as good citizens and leaders of the community should be encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for me one of the important benefits of this visit program was the links that were made with many who once were the enemy. Time and time again, from officials, from retired Vietnamese army officers who had once fought against Australians, came the message:  `It is time to put the past behind us, build links for the future, but never forget those who suffered and died.' This is the message that I have conveyed to Australian ex&hyphen;service organisations, most recently at the RSL's National Congress held last week in Tweed Heads. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the orphanage site, for example, the now retired Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Van Kiem, former commanding officer of D445 battalion which fought against the Australian forces at Long Tan, chatted enthusiastically with our veterans. We also met with Colonel Nguyen Thanh Hong, the former operations officer of 5 VC Division and the planner of the Battle of Long Tan. Colonel Hong has been quite ill, and it speaks volumes, I think, that he made such a determined effort to meet with us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some of those veterans or family members who went on this revisit program there were, I am sure, moments of deep, and perhaps painful, reflection. For some it may have meant a stepping away from the past, a closing of a chapter in their lives. For others, it was confirmation that our two countries can <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4003"> put aside the past, and work together as regional neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These 30 veterans were ambassadors for all Australians and particularly for the 59,000 who served in Vietnam. The significance of our involvement in Vietnam should not be understated. It was our longest running continuous military commitment as a nation. Now, as each of the veteran representatives returns home and begins to relate his or her experiences and feelings to others in the Vietnam veteran community, no doubt they will be catalysts for healing for others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, despite the hope and promise we all share for the future, we cannot and must not forget the personal price that many Australians paid in serving their country. It was a turbulent time in our nation's history and tragically many of our veterans and their families felt the impact of that turbulence during their service and on their return home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments of one of the veterans at the welcome home reception hosted at Sydney airport by my colleague the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), crystallised for me the healing value of visits such as these. After the first commemorative ceremony the memories and the emotion were too much, he said. He thought he couldn't go on. After the second ceremony in Singapore, again he thought, this is too much, I can't go on. After the visit to Long Tan, he knew it would be hard, but he wanted to go on. The healing had begun. Now he would like to take his family on a return visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would not be out of place, I believe, if I were to paraphrase part of what I said at the ceremony at Kranji. `To each of you who served in Vietnam, we say thank you. We know that for some the cost was high. For some it was their very lives; for others it was a hurt and suffering that even the passage of time has not yet healed. But we recognise and value your experiences and we shall endeavour to ensure that all Australians today and in the future know and remember as well.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians generally take a great deal of interest in Vietnam. Yet, even so, the relationship between Vietnam and Australia is a lot closer than some people realise. The twinning of Vung Tau and the Australian city of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Parramatta is but one example of the increasing friendship between our two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of our large companies have set up offices there to work together with Vietnamese partners to develop important business and trade links. Indeed, the visits by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and by the veterans group will, I am sure, not only further strengthen the already very strong relationship between our two countries but assist in furthering opportunities for Vietnam and Australia to cooperate in a range of fields. There is a myriad of opportunities available to Australian companies. The proud and responsible way in which our veterans have represented Australia during and since their involvement in the Vietnam conflict has played a significant role in developing the strong relationship that exists today between the two countries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It is with a great deal of personal pleasure that I lend my support to the comments made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) on the recent return to Vietnam to commemorate 30 years on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset I thank the minister and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In the true tradition that has emerged in this place on veterans' affairs matters, they took the bipartisan approach of inviting me to represent this side of the parliament. It was indeed a great privilege to be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As somebody who, of course, was of the age to have actually been sent there back in the 1960s, as somebody whose number did in fact come out of that magic barrel at the time but as somebody who, for a variety of reasons, did not end up going, I have to say that the importance of the opportunity that was provided to me could in no way be diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4004"> What it did for me, as somebody who represents the veterans' community from the opposition side of the House, was to clearly etch in my mind the sorts of adventures, the sorts of problems, the devastation, the heart ache and the continuing memories that men and women who served in Vietnam continue to endure. Like the minister, I could not help but be struck by those 30 men and women who accompanied us on that particular visit. I could not help but be struck by the sense of camaraderie which immediately developed when they first got together. I could not help but be struck by the deep sense of understanding amongst each and every one of them that, whilst they may not have come across each other on specific battlefields in the course of the Vietnam War, they nevertheless knew what it meant to represent this country in that theatre of war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I for one, as I think they did, came to reflect well and truly on the view of many people back here that the healing process was indeed going to be long but that in fact it was taking place. Not only was that healing process to which the minister referred the opportunity taken by the 30 people who were there to perhaps exorcise many of the demons of battles past, but I think the opportunity also was there to be at peace with themselves regarding the role that they played as soldiers, as nurses, as support staff, indeed even as entertainers. As a number of them said to me, `We were there doing a job. And it took a long time, when we came back, for the Australian people to remember we were there doing a job.' They should not have been blamed if there was any concern about the outcome; they should not have been blamed for actually being there&mdash;it was the governments of the day which sent them. I think that is a real sentiment, and we should reflect on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say, as I got to know each of those people there, that I recognised that each and every one of them had a special reason to be there and a special memory of Vietnam, whether it was that they had lost a loved one in battle or whether it was like that of Jim Richmond&mdash;who was referred to earlier&mdash;who had fought in the Battle of Long Tan, had been severely wounded and not been found until the next day. This was the first time he had gone back. He spent 12 months in hospital recuperating. One of the other people on the visit with us was actually a nurse who had <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> looked after him. She said that he was a terrible patient. The things they got up to are the sorts of stories that you cannot repeat here or, probably, anywhere else. That was the sort of attitude these people showed. I thought it marvellous to talk to these people and to get a sense of them coming back&mdash;of going to Long Tan, Nui Dat, Vung Tau&mdash;and coming to peace with themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the process was just being there. Part of it was being on the bus and singing a whole variety of songs out of a song book that Patricia Thompson&mdash;otherwise known as Little Pattie&mdash;had provided for us, singing what I think developed into the anthem of all of us on that particular visit: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We gotta get out of this place</EMPHASIS>. I think anybody of the age at that time would know&mdash;and it doesn't matter whether you are a Vietnam veteran or somebody who was at university at the time&mdash;that this was the anthem of the day: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We gotta get out of this place</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something about the visit which will always stay in my mind was the way in which people bonded together: they talked together and relived experiences; they discovered they knew people from different units; and on it went.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also touched on the friendliness of the people who were there. We cannot let this opportunity go by without making a comment about the Vietnamese people. It is time for healing; it is time to put the past behind us. These days Australia's relations with Vietnam are at an extraordinary level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit of the Minister for Trade, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer)&mdash;in that role and also being with us at Nui Dat for a very emotional ceremony&mdash;cannot, I think, be understated. Everybody knows that the Deputy Prime Minister in fact served in Vietnam. I have to say that I was particularly moved by the address that he gave at Nui Dat. As we all came to know what it must have been like to be there&mdash;as the 30 who returned obviously did&mdash;we could understand what emotions must have been running through the Deputy Prime Minister at the time he gave that address. I commend him for it. I think he said some very appropriate words; he really did speak from the heart.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4005">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of people who were part of the visit also require our thanks. I thank the Department of Veterans' Affairs, particularly Morrie and Pam who were with us. They were the organisers who bossed us around and ensured that everybody was up on time and on the bus. They did head counts and made sure that the various activities that were carried out were done with a great deal of reverence, certainly, and very efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other people who need to be thanked include the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade personnel based both in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. The minister referred to the Ambassador, Sue Boyd. I pay tribute to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among the journalists who participated was Peter Charlton, who is in the gallery this afternoon. Somebody such as he, with an intimate knowledge of the area through having been involved himself, lent a very special sense of occasion to the visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very pleased to hear that much of what the group was doing in Vietnam was being relayed back to Australia. If there is one thing we always have to keep in our minds when commemorative events of this nature, or commemorative events such as Australia Remembers last year, take place is that as a spin&hyphen;off there has to be an educational program. The young people of today have to be talked to and told, `This is what it was like then and these are the reasons the involvement took place.' War is hell; war is not good. We do not want to see a repeat of it; I do not think anyone on either side would want to say anything other than that. From that point of view, I think it was important that television footage and media reports were coming back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also made reference to the Ba Ria orphanage and the work that is being done there. I commend those people as well as the minister. I think the fact that Australian money is going in to help rebuild such a very important aspect of Vietnamese life is to be commended. Non-government organisations such as this which are giving such assistance I think deserve our praise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than prolong this particular comment and support for the minister's speech, can I just, in conclusion, simply say to all our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> colleagues here in this House and those people in the veterans' community: I commend to you the August 1996 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vetaffairs</EMPHASIS>, the newspaper for the veterans' community, because it actually lists all the people who were there&mdash;except me, Minister, I might say. But that is okay, I will forgive you this time. It does have some really good photographs of the veterans who were there&mdash;</PARA>

They were just a marvellous group of individuals. I do commend this document to all members in this place because it does give you a very good run&hyphen;down on each and every one of the people who were there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by again thanking the minister for including me as part of this delegation. It was a great privilege to represent the Labor Party in Vietnam as part of this delegation. I look forward to continuing the role that has been entrusted to me by the Leader of the Opposition to represent the veterans' community from our side of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have remarked on a number of occasions to the minister, we are very fortunate in that this issue has enjoyed bipartisanship over a long period of time. It is something which I think we will continue to do. And I believe that exercises such as this will enhance not only that relationship in the parliament amongst parliamentarians but the relationships amongst those 30 people who were part of this delegation and the roles that they have played once again in enshrining, I think, in Australia just that sense of Australianness, of camaraderie, of dedication to duty and love of their own country. Minister, again I thank you for the opportunity to be part of that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to address what I regard as the most important issue for all Australians&mdash;all Australians, but especially Australians living in regional Australia at this point in time. I specifically refer to the consequences for Telstra workers&mdash;including massive job losses and the likelihood that cheap foreign labour will be used to replace Australian workers&mdash;following the sale of Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, this is an issue of major concern. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will tell you why this is an issue of major concern: the reality of life is that unemployment is the most important challenge confronting Australia as a nation at the moment. The problem is that, during the recent federal election campaign, the coalition sought to clothe itself in a mantle of concern about jobs&mdash;yes, jobs for all Australians: jobs for our young, jobs for the old, jobs for women, jobs for people of a non-English speaking background and jobs for the people of rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the H.R. Nicholls Society, that fellow traveller organisation of the Liberal Party, in a recent publication did a count of Mr Howard's comments on unemployment made during the election campaign. What does that count show? Unfortunately, as is evidenced in the recent budget, Mr Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, has a very short memory. The H. R. Nicholls Society <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> count showed that, out of some 80 speeches, interviews of one kind or another, press statements, et cetera during the election campaign, in at least 41 he emphasised the social and economic gravity of the unemployment problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But oh what a difference six months makes. Six months into this government, jobs and the unemployed as a priority have suddenly disappeared. Six months into this government the Prime Minister is trying to distance himself from the issues of job creation. Six months into this government we have a budget where the word `unemployment' is either a dirty word or pronounced in whispers. I would remind the House that unemployment virtually received no mention in the government's keynote budget speech by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on budget night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Six months later we actually have a new jobs policy from this government&mdash;and what is that jobs policy about? It is about `destroy'&mdash;to destroy jobs in the private sector; to destroy jobs in the public sector; to destroy thousands of jobs in the telecommunications industry all around Australia; and especially to destroy jobs in Telstra in regional Australia. Oh, and by the way, with a wink and a nod from the government, it seems to have told the future privatised Telstra that it is okay to want to sell off Telstra workers' jobs to the Philippines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note from question time today that Mr Blount, the Chief Executive Officer of Telstra, is now seeking to suggest to the Australian public that he has not been involved in any discussions concerning the merits of such proposals. All I can say to Mr Blount is that he ought to go and examine the minutes that were supplied in confidence from a commercial point of view to the recent Telstra inquiry by the Senate. Those minutes show beyond a doubt that the secret&mdash;yes, very secret&mdash;Project Mercury team that was established within six weeks of the election of 2 March has actively considered, and is going to continue to actively consider, such a proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and Mr Blount is that, with respect to the minutes of Project Mercury, ignorance is not a defence. The minutes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4007"> supplied in confidence to the Senate committee, the committee of inquiry into Telstra, show beyond any doubt that it is an active proposal, that it is afoot and that Telstra, with the support of the Howard government, has no consideration for the potential job losses in regional Australia&mdash;especially those that will occur in the home state of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This wink and a nod approach is also embedded in the coalition's attitudes that come out in their proposals to introduce cruel workplace laws. There is no talk of best practice in their cruel workplace laws; no talk of training and skilling the work force as an investment in these cruel workplace laws; no talk of cooperation between Telstra management, its workers and their unions in their new, cruel workplace laws. All we hear is traditional tory government cant, traditional tory government bogey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You know what the bogey is, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;although, I might say, it has a new twist. The twist is that it says to Telstra workers living in Townsville, Roma, Cairns and the Gold Coast: `If you are not prepared to accept Philippines standards of pay and working conditions, you can expect your job to disappear from underneath you; you can expect your job to be exported to the Philippines.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And this government will not stand in the way; that is the truth of the matter. The approach of this government is to let the market rip&mdash;let the disk jockeys in the money market have their heads. That is all the Treasurer is concerned about; he is not concerned about jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government suggests that it is unconstitutional to be involved in supporting regional Australia. As far as the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) are concerned there is no role for government in assisting regional Australia; there is no role for this government to do something actively to reduce unemployment in Australia; and there is no role for this government to go out of its way to intervene in the marketplace to try to invest in getting people job ready to get them back to work.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House that, after the federal election, Telstra management, led by Mr Blount, felt confident enough and brazen enough to set up a secret committee, which they called Project Mercury, to plan for life as a privatised company. For some strange reason, this secret committee, Project Mercury, was established in addition to their normal business planning committees. I urge Mr Blount to consider the minutes of the Project Mercury team. I will tell you why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Project Mercury is part of an attempt to carry out what would best be described as the largest company restructuring in Australia's corporate history. But its aim is the important issue. Its aim is to destroy thousands of jobs in Australia, thousands of jobs for people in regional Australia. Why? Because of market pressures and the desire of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister to let the market rip, to let the disk jockeys in the money market have their heads. That is the simple answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that one of the most brazen things discussed by the Project Mercury steering committee is the exporting of thousands of Australian jobs to the Philippines. I have seen the notes of the meeting of the Project Mercury steering committee held just 10 weeks ago&mdash;notes, it seems, Mr Blount, the Chief Executive Officer of Telstra, now suggests he has no knowledge of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to a section highlighted as proposal 3, which clearly recommends the establishment of a Philippines operator assistance service centre. What does that really mean? It means that a privatised Telstra is planning to sell to the lowest bidder&mdash;in this case, the Philippines&mdash;the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Australian workers. More importantly, by far the majority of those workers are women, many of them in rural and regional Australia&mdash;in centres such as Roma in Queensland where, interestingly enough, Telstra is the biggest employer in town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About 50 people are employed in directory assistance in Roma&mdash;most of them women. Can you imagine the devastating effect on the town, on the local people, on the families, if the 50 salaries from those 50 jobs stop coming into that region? Think about the other jobs that will disappear from Roma if you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4008"> take 50 jobs out of that region. Think about the impact on the private sector because of the inability of those people to continue to purchase local goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is worse than that. Throughout Queensland there are similar centres where jobs are in jeopardy: Ipswich, 30 jobs&mdash;I notice that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is not in attendance today, so obviously Telstra jobs in Ipswich are not important to her&mdash;Maryborough, 70 jobs; Rockhampton, 120 jobs; Mackay, 70 jobs; Southport, 120 jobs; Cairns, 90 jobs; Toowoomba, 120 jobs; and Nambour, 120 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the real big one is Townsville. In Townsville&mdash;a major government centre already decimated by decisions in the government's budget process&mdash;many hundreds of Telstra jobs are disappearing from the city. I suggest that they are important regional jobs and important jobs for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A privatised Telstra will clearly tell these women one thing when the industrial agreement that Telstra is party to runs out. It will tell them in black and white, in plain and simple terms, `Either you accept Third World standards of pay and working conditions or we will hand your jobs over to Filipinos.' It will tell them: `Either you take the cut in wages or conditions or your jobs go to the Philippines.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that regional Australia has already taken too big a battering from the Howard government. MPs on the opposite side of this chamber should hang their heads in shame. It is about time they stood up for regional Australia. It is about time they required the Howard government to provide decent services to regional Australia. It is wrong to suggest that, if you live outside the major metropolitan areas and capital cities of this country, you are not entitled to Australian government services&mdash;Australian government services which I believe should be supplied on the basis that it is one Australia, all Australians are equal and all Australians are entitled to access to decent government services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Go through the seats that the privatisation of Telstra will have a huge impact on, such as those in Queensland. Where is the member <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), the person who supported the closure of the Mareeba CES office? What does he have to say about Telstra jobs?

It is about time the coalition government decided that we as a nation are required to invest in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, if Senator Colston is concerned about jobs for regional Queensland, then it is about time he faced up to his responsibilities and stood up to and opposed the Howard government's suggestion that Telstra ought to be privatised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point about the member's MPI is that Telstra is shedding jobs and that it has some sort of secret plan. That is an absolute nonsense, and the government rejects that. The first point to be made, and I made this in the summation of the very lengthy debate about the government's intentions with regard to Telstra, is that there are going to be and there have been some job reductions in Telstra&mdash;and I will quote the job reduction numbers which have occurred over quite a period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the role of the board and management, not government, to determine strategies to achieve the objectives to be competitive in an ever competitive industry such as the telecommunications industry. Any reduction in those staff numbers will be dependent on factors such as the market conditions that prevail at the time and the commercial pressures in that market. What also needs to be taken into account is that this is one of the fastest growing, if not the fastest growing, industry segments. It is estimated that there has been about an 18 per cent growth in jobs opportunities in the telecommunications industry.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least in the past you have taken some time to look more closely at some of the issues. Telstra, it has been made quite clear by Frank Blount and the board, is already aware that, in order to position itself for competition in post-1997 and to achieve world's best practice, one of the key management challenges over the coming years will be the improvement of workplace productivity levels. I think all of us would agree that that will be necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we have a look at what is happening within the Telstra numbers, and this is the interesting part, we see that there has been a 20,000 job reduction number within Telstra from 1989-90 to 1993-94&mdash;that is full-time operative jobs&mdash;from 84,899 to 63,567 at the end of 1993-94. It has gone up a little bit since then to deal with some of the new work that they are undertaking with Visionstream and so on.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that question. The point of your MPI is that there is some government agenda to accelerate the process of job reduction in Telstra above and beyond the normal commercial orientation of the company. What I have just demonstrated is that, during the period you were in charge of Telstra as the major shareholder, there were very significant job reductions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, when you go through some of the data that has been put into the Telstra committee report&mdash;and I will refer to that in a moment&mdash;you will see that there is a recognition from all of your own colleagues that the reason why there has been a reduction in jobs within Telstra is primarily that of technology. We can even go to a report recently by the Department of Finance. What we have to do is address the fundamental drivers of what is happening here rather than respond to the emotive issues that you have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been talking about today. The finance department said in its report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the one hand, Telstra's historic concentration of regionally based employment may, like the railways before them, no longer be needed to the same extent because of the higher reliability and lower maintenance costs of modern technology. At the same time, Telstra's more competitive services can be expected to strengthen the locational advantages of some regional areas for new or expanded economic activity.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me give you an example. I represent a regional seat, a very important regional seat. We have seen a reduction in the number of Telstra workers that sit in the exchange. The member for Burke knows that the switching capacities do not require there to be people present all the time because that can be done digitally and by way of remote control.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You might say that you did that; but there was a lot of work that went in with Telstra from me, as the opposition spokesman at the time, to get the optic fibre cable across Bass Strait to make that a reality. Mind you, it has never been recognised by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Launceston Examiner</EMPHASIS>  as such. Maybe they are listening today, but somehow I doubt it. That went to the benefit <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4011"> of regional employment opportunities in an ever expanding telecommunications industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am making to you is that that reduction of jobs is recognised as being a function of technology. I have pulled out some quotes from the report. Mr Cooper, the Divisional President of the CEPU, your union, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the figures that have been put to us, we have agreed in some areas that there can be staff reductions. We have been through all these processes with new technology.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McLean, the Branch Secretary of the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. The major driver is technology.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tierney asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You would agree that these technological changes will continue?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McLean said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, and the union recognises that.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For jobs that are technically driven it does not matter about ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>He is saying that it does not matter about ownership. Senator Tierney asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aren't people going to be able to pick up jobs in the communications industry&mdash;they might be Optus or new players?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McLean said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is true to a degree.</PARA>
<PARA>And there will be new players. Let us have a look at what the chief of the Telecommunications Users Group, Mr Allan Horsley, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me make the point that the industry is desperately short of people. We cannot find them&mdash;we put ads in the paper and our members are looking for people and cannot find them . . . Our experience has been that there is substantial demand for employment and if, as a result of any process, this or just management changes in Telstra result in fewer employees, those employees will pick up work, without a doubt, outside . . . It is not overstating the case to say that the demand is enormous.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the industry. The independent industry is telling us that the demand for telecommunications work is enormous. Mr Cooper said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of jobs has actually grown. My understanding is that it is currently just over about 76,000. It dropped down to about 65,000 about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> three years ago and they learned that they could not provide the service with that staff and had to re&hyphen;recruit&mdash;skilled labour particularly.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes up and down as new technology is engaged, as new services operate and as they meet the market demands. Let me quote Mr Perkins. He represents the Service Providers Action Network. He is involved in one of the companies that is going to be one of the new players&mdash;AAP Telecommunications. There is a whole host of new players that will be coming onto the marketplace. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I do say is that at the present time it is extremely difficult for my company and our competitors to find suitable personnel for our operations. We are having great difficulty. There is an acute shortage of staff in the telecommunications industry today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We advertise and we get very few qualified people, particularly in areas like engineering . . . But when you get into the more technical areas of our companies, in the marketing even and in the operations and customer services areas, we have great difficulty in getting people.</PARA>
<PARA>So there are many opportunities in that industry in particular. What I am saying to the member for Batman is that it is not sufficient just to say that this is about some secret deal by the government to reduce jobs. It is well recognised in the industry that there have been continual demands for job rationalisation within Telstra and they are the figures that I quoted to you&mdash;20,000 reduced whilst you were there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I well remember, prior to the 1993 election, the then minister for communications, Senator Richardson, ordering Telstra to stop its program of rationalisation of job requirements. I can understand the political sensitivity of what you are saying, but it is not good enough to put out emotional press releases unnecessarily scaring people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me come to the issue of the Philippines. You quoted the minutes and so on. But Project Mercury, which was dealt with in quite some detail within the report, is an internal working group within Telstra established to look at ways in which it will need to respond to the prospect of the market competition that is going to be there. Basically it was an ideas shop. Project Mercury was an ideas shop and it was there to consider <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4012"> different ways of doing things which would allow it to improve service and efficiency. We know that it has to improve service and efficiency. Indeed, most of the Telstra unions know, and I have talked to many of them. They recognise that this must happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra has no intention, and has never had any intention, of outsourcing operator assisted services to the Philippines. That was made quite clear in question time today by my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, spoke with the Managing Director of Telstra, Frank Blount, today and he advised that he has not been involved in any discussions canvassing the merits or otherwise of these proposals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks of the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) in this MPI and to reject totally what I believe is a cover&hyphen;up that has just been presented by the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith). Clearly, this government's policy to sell Telstra is the beginning of the end of another Australian industry. This issue relates directly to employment and, as such, I have a very keen interest in the impact that this government decision will have on regional Australia but, more particularly, on my electorate. I am also concerned about the ripple effect that goes through the work force once unemployment is faced. This issue relates to all sorts of social issues and social problems. I think it is appropriate to discuss all these matters in this particular MPI.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly the sale of Telstra as originally proposed by the government will result in many thousands of job losses directly and indirectly through support industries. If we move down the track to the full sale of Telstra&mdash;as forecast and described as inevitable by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston&mdash;the problem will be significantly compounded. We will then have a multitude of problems: economic hardship for the unemployed and a strain on our social security services; loss of technology where currently Telstra relies heavily on Australian industries to supply its technological components; a privatised Telstra is more likely to consider buying cheaper overseas products built by cheap foreign labour; skills will be lost as Australian workers and industry will not be used to produce and install new  equipment for Telstra; and there will be a flow&hyphen;on effect in the training area where the government is saying that they are trying to do great things.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not much good the government training kids in schools if there is no industry for those kids to go into. I would submit that when you look at an industry like Telstra you are looking very much at training young Australians. It is big industries such as Telstra that really do most of the training. I do not think it is much good putting finance and resources into schools if we are going to have this government policy of selling off major enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me dwell on the unemployment question. The government has admitted that they are unable to reduce unemployment below the current level of 8.5 per cent. A report carried out for the federal government by the National Institute of Labour Studies has said that the federal government's labour market programs are expected to have a negligible impact on unemployment. Mass retrenchments at Telstra because of a half sale or, further down the track, a full sale would result in a considerable increase in the current unemployment levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the consequences for areas such as western Sydney? Already we have higher than average unemployment. Some 70 per cent of our population travel outside the area to work. The population has moved west but the jobs have stayed in the east. In my few months in this place I have continued to advocate more employment and training opportunities for working people in western Sydney. It breaks my heart to see further increases in unemployment due to government policy such as the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my maiden speech only a few months ago I referred to the need for employment and training in the west of Sydney. Let me remind the House that in Greenway by the year 2006 our population will equal that of Canberra. On 2 May I also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me say something about training for employment. It is important that we match the training that is available to young people in Greenway and surrounding areas with employment opportunities in local industry and the growth jobs of the future. </PARA>
<PARA>What has happened since then? The government has brought out all its artillery and conducted a massive slash and burn campaign. It has cut back on staff, it has closed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4014"> Medicare offices, it has literally destroyed the CES, it has strangled skillshare and it has brought labour market programs to their knees. It will now see thousands of Telstra workers made redundant, all in the name of budgetary balancing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These actions by the government will not help employment prospects in western Sydney where there are many Telstra workers as residents. What the government is doing is waging an old&hyphen;fashioned ideological attack on working people in my region and in other parts of Australia, not just through Telstra but through all its actions. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gloated that many of the ordinary workers of Australia, like Telstra workers, voted for him on 2 March. They may well have done so, but only once and never again&mdash;once bitten, twice shy. We recently ended the training guarantee levy and in that debate I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is and was a totally defensible piece of Labor legislation that I hope we never have to repeat, for it would be to our nation's commercial peril if we ever backslid to the days of almost nil training within industry, with parasite companies feeding off the few responsible and committed companies.</PARA>
<PARA>When I watch with despair the number of talented people being thrown on the scrap heap of unemployment by this government, through its cuts to and sale of Telstra, I really worry for the future of Australia. When I see the various labour market programs being dismantled, programs that were working for the unemployed to make them employable, I see even more clearly that the training levy was an incentive to train. Now there is none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we to train people for? All our talented workers are being treated like dross on a melting pot. Employment for people in western Sydney is absolutely vital for our future as a nation. I simply do not know how hard working groups like BREED, skillshare and other labour market programs, which have performed brilliantly, will be able to cope with the vast number of public servants and Telstra workers becoming unemployed in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many thousands of western Sydney residents were able to become employed through the hard work and dedication of these groups. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I have quoted the following information before in this House but it bears repeating as it underscores the work that should be able to be done, but will not, when all our Telstra workers hit the unemployment ranks, joining the other thousands of public servants. I referred to the West Jobs campaign and in this House I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This campaign was run by the Outer Western Sydney and Central Western Area Consultative Committee. Its aim was to find 4,000 positions in a period of three months. It was overwhelmingly successful due to the support of small business and, in fact, 7,500 positions were created during that period.</PARA>
<PARA>But how does this caring bunch opposite respond? They cut funds to everything that could be useful to the working people in our major metropolitan areas. They close schemes, they sell off Telstra and they create more unemployment. Only this week in the Senate, Senator Newman boasted that the changes in child care would be welcomed widely. In the centre I visited last week, the directors are looking at cutting services, increasing fees and cutting staff numbers. How is that helping unemployment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of Telstra, the funding cuts and the closure of programs have some odd side effects on employment. That simply does not seem to bother this government. Take the important area of higher education in an institution such as the University of Western Sydney. This is a major employer in western Sydney. With its likely staff cuts there must be fewer students. This means fewer graduates. Now there will be fewer skilled people and fewer people who are employed. But, over there, who cares anyhow? It is certainly not the heartless Senator Vanstone who seems more intent on abusing students than on educating them for employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The western region of Sydney is being very badly treated by this government in a multitude of areas including employment and training and the sale of Telstra with the consequent sacking of thousands of employees, many of whom live in my electorate. This makes the prospects for our residents look blacker and blacker as the days of this awful government unfold.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4015">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could try to look at this on a bright note. The retrenched Telstra workers will not have to worry about retraining because there are no labour market training programs left. They will not have to worry about child care because they will be able to stay at home and look after their own children while, at the same time, living off their superannuation benefits without social security benefits. They will not have to worry about the lack of university places because the retrenched workers will not be able to afford to send their own kids to university.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LK6">Mr MAREK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to hear what it is. I have not heard it, but I think the joke has already had his speech. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) talks of union status and representation in an attempt to convince the public that he is here to save Telstra jobs and project union solidarity. What a load of rot! It is because his government let the union movement down that the unions supported the National&hyphen;Liberal coalition government, for we saw that the grass may be greener on the other side of the fence. I know what it feels like to negotiate and lead the members out the gate over a sensitive issue that is affecting them, whether it be job losses or unscrupulous behaviour by a company official, and spend days or weeks on the grass.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder whether Mr Ferguson has ever negotiated at the coalface. I would say not. I bet he would not know how to operate at that level. Yet Mr Ferguson projects that unions can rely only on Labor. I hate to dispel the myth, but unions have always prospered under coalition governments. Coalition governments have often given unions what they want. Yet under Labor they are told to sit down and shut up, because they have their minds set on winning the next election and they do not want trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman talks of Telstra job losses. I did not hear a whisper from him or the unions when Telstra shed more than <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 20,000 jobs between 1991 and 1994. Under the former Labor government there was not a moan or a groan to be heard from the member for Batman. In fact, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) was fighting hard to maintain positions in Telstra. They had some 250 employees reduced to 50 employees under Labor. So I ask the member for Batman: `Where are his statements coming from?' At that time the job losses in Telstra left the company short skilled on staff&mdash;notably linesmen in Queensland. By the time it had restored them, they had lost valuable skills, demoralised staff and copped bad customer service ratings. Yet I remind the House that we heard absolutely nothing&mdash;zilch, zero, naught&mdash;from the member for Batman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be clear: it is not this government that is cutting Telstra jobs; it is a decision made by the Telstra executive in the lead&hyphen;up to the 1997 deregulated market. To try to bring into the debate some notion that thousands of jobs are going to be lost to the Philippines is merely fictitious humbug. Where is the evidence? Mr Blount does not know about it, and I would have thought that he would have been the first one to know. If there is any truth in the allegations, surely you would be tabling the evidence for all to see. How come Mr Ferguson is the only one with this information? I hear the noise that he is making and I say that the statements of the member for Batman are nothing less than hypocritical. He is driving for nothing but political mileage, not for the real issue: Telstra jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look very closely at what has caused the loss of jobs for working people in past years&mdash;award restructuring, new work models, demarcation and enterprise bargaining agreements. It sounds like something the Labor government and some of your irrational Labor union mates were saying previous to the March election that this is what the coalition government will bring about upon attaining office. Look out, Mr Ferguson, because here comes the truth: your government did it to the unionists two to three years ago. That is right; you sold us out. Our forefathers turned in their graves over your government's betrayal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4016"> of the union movement in past years. That is why I am here in parliament now. It is because of your government's lack of attention to the grassroots members and because you concern yourselves only with your own job protection, your own egos and life in an ivory tower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The claim of Telstra job losses by the member for Batman is nothing but unsubstantiated allegations. His statements are full of empty rhetoric, nasty and grubby inferences, and they should be treated with the contempt they deserve. It is incredible that someone of Mr Ferguson's position should have left himself so open to criticism by making such ambit statements and having no clear-cut evidence from Telstra executive management.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is coming up next. It certainly must make the general public think twice about their representations when they hear statements like this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be something in the Labor Party water, because the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) came unstuck in Rockhampton last week with similar stupid statements not about Telstra job losses but about university funding cuts and regional development in central Queensland. His statements were totally misleading and incorrect relating to both areas of Capricornia. They have received a boost from the budget, not a cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear to me, and I am now sure to the rest of Australia, that this Labor opposition has learnt nothing from the previous election in relation to scaremongering and misinformation. Mr Ferguson and his team should sit down and do some real soul searching over their tactics and their future direction, because they have a very long way to go before the electorate will ever listen to them again. Gone are the days of public scaremongering. This country deserves better than this, and it is about time the Labor opposition put strong positive arguments and not this load of claptrap. The employees I know that work in Telstra work with a sense of pride and work to create a telecommunications system within Australia that will lead this country into a new era of technology and state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art communication.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman has made these ridiculous ambit claims, but one has to ask why. Where is the evidence to substantiate such claims that drives worry and fear into Australian homes? I say, `Shame, shame on you, Mr Ferguson.' You shall be held accountable for your ambit claims. I say to Australians who are hurting and struck by worry and uncertainty by this unwarranted and unsubstantiated tripe to inundate the member for Batman with telephone calls and faxes. Give him some real work to do for a change, instead of putting good Australians under a form of pressure that is totally unwarranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me finish by saying that I will be working hard to ensure all Telstra employees in Capricornia and regional Australia maintain their jobs, and the only cuts will come from voluntary redundancies and natural attrition so that the level of service provided by Telstra continues to flourish and grow.</PARA>

<PARA>This bill, together with the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill 1996, will give effect to the centrepiece of the government's election commitment to Australian families, the family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost two million families with dependent children&mdash;the majority of Australian families with dependent children&mdash;will receive a major boost from this initiative. It will direct around $1 billion a year extra to families, providing much needed extra help in bringing up children. The family tax initiative will commence on 1 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family tax initiative is a clear example of the government's commitment to giving families greater choice in how they spend their hard&hyphen;earned cash and in how they juggle work and family responsibilities. Each family is the best judge of what it needs, and the government's program of reforms reflects that approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4019"> The family tax initiative provides two forms of assistance. Part A has the effect of increas ing the tax free threshold by $1,000 for one parent in a family for each dependent child up to the age of 16 years and each dependent secondary student up to 18 years. This assistance will be available to families that have a combined taxable income of less than $70,000, with an increase of $3,000 for each child after the first. By increasing the threshold tax at the rate of 20c in the dollar is saved with the effect that eligible families receive the equivalent of an increase of $200 per annum in their disposable income for each dependent child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additional assistance, part B of the initiative, will be directed towards single income families, including lone parents, with young children. There will be an increase in the tax free threshold of $2,500 for one parent in those families who have at least one child aged under five years and provided that the breadwinner's income is less than $65,000 per annum&mdash;with an increase of $3,000 for each child after the first&mdash;and the spouse's income is less than the income cut&hyphen;off for basic parenting allowance&mdash;currently $174.43 per fortnight. The alignment of the spouse's income test with the cut&hyphen;off for basic parenting allowance provides a realistic measure of the workforce activity of the principal carer and ensures greater consistency in the treatment of predominantly single income families. This assistance will give families the equivalent of an increase in their disposable income of $500 per annum&mdash;around $19.20 per fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two methods of delivery for the family tax initiative. First, the majority of eligible families with children will be assisted through the income tax system. This bill gives effect to the tax free threshold adjustments to deliver both part A and part B assistance to families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Low income families will be able to receive the family tax initiative as a fortnightly direct payment through the Department of Social Security. Some 900,000 families will receive an immediate boost to their disposable income through this measure. The extra fortnightly amount will be known as the family tax payment and will ensure that low income families, who might not have a high enough <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tax liability to benefit fully from the changes to the tax system, will get the help they need when they need it most. Amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 to provide for family tax payments are contained in the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill 1996 which is being introduced as part of this package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises that providing an economic and social environment in which families can achieve their full potential is crucial to maintaining a strong, cohesive and compassionate society. Providing financial assistance to those families with the greatest need is an investment in that economic and social environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pressures that families face in juggling their work and child raising responsibilities are arguably greater today than ever before. One of the keys to relieving these pressures is to increase the real opportunities available to families and to give them more genuine choices about how they live. The government has a commitment to pursue policies that enable families to choose how they balance their work and child raising responsibilities. The government is committed to ensuring that families with young children are given greater freedom to choose whether one parent cares full time for their children at home or whether both are in the paid workforce. The family tax initiative acknowledges the central role that families have in supporting the foundation of Australian society</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like at this point to record thanks to people in my office who did so much work on this proposal prior to the election and who are able to see the government implement this commitment&mdash;a commitment to families&mdash;which was the centrepiece that we put to Australian families at the last election.

<PARA>The Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill 1996 forms part of my portfolio's significant contribution to the government's task of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> achieving major savings in outlays. The bill amends the Proceeds of Crime Act by providing for the transfer each year of the net balance of the confiscated assets trust fund to the consolidated revenue fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The net balance will be calculated by deducting from the balance those payments that have to be made for statutory purposes. Payments that have to be made for statutory purposes include a prescribed annual management fee; payments under the equitable sharing program to the states and territories where the Commonwealth has been able to recover proceeds because of the significant contribution of a state or territory law enforcement agency; and payments by way of restitution to innocent third parties or where quashing of a conviction causes discharge of a forfeiture order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also offers increased payments into the confiscated assets trust fund and subsequently into consolidated revenue by extending the present equitable sharing program to the international arena. The proposed international sharing arrangement is intended to promote Australian law enforcement strategy by increasing the motivation of foreign countries to assist in recovering assets in their jurisdictions which are subject to forfeiture under Australian legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arrangement will authorise payment into the confiscated assets trust fund of payments made to Australia by a foreign country in recognition of assistance provided by Commonwealth law enforcement agencies; and it will give me the discretion to authorise payment to a foreign country where that country has made a significant contribution to the recovery of proceeds under a Commonwealth law. Increasingly, Australia needs assistance from other countries in relation to the investigation of sophisticated organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed sharing arrangement would provide an incentive to other countries to initiate or support investigations of Australian criminal activity. Australia stands to benefit substantially from the arrangement, because the proposed sharing arrangement is likely to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4021"> foster a net inflow of confiscated proceeds into Australia. In order to be able to encourage and promote sharing with Australia of proceeds recovered by foreign countries, Australia must be able to reciprocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arrangement is in addition to any other `sharing' of recovered proceeds which may apply when, under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987, Australia is able to have its proceeds orders enforced in a foreign county and the proceeds repatriated to Australia, or to enforce a foreign country's proceeds orders in an Australian court and return the funds to that country. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 will amend the Family Law Act 1975 to provide a power for the Governor&hyphen;General in Council to make regulations which provide for fees to be charged for use of the voluntary counselling and mediation services of the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment is part of the government's overall budget strategy to reduce the massive budget deficit that this government has inherited. The essence of the government's response to the $8 billion budget deficit black hole has been to make sensible reductions in outlays and increases in user charges to ensure that the burden of the need to reduce the deficit is shared across the whole community. To ensure a fair distribution, each area must play its part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will allow regulations to be made prescribing fees to be charged only for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> voluntary counselling and mediation services provided by the Family Court. At present those using these services often make no contribution to the running costs of the court. I remind honourable members that the cost of running the Family Court is now in excess of $100 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major considerations favouring the imposition of fees in this area is the fact that the Commonwealth funds the Family Court to provide counselling and mediation services and also funds community based service providers which provide similar services. The community based sector provides those services for a fee to those who can afford to pay. Those who cannot afford to pay are exempt from fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The demand is such that it is not possible for all to have access to the Family Court's services. In these circumstances it is inequitable that a service is provided for a fee to some&mdash;often residents of rural and remote locations&mdash;but others, purely on the basis of geography, receive a similar service for free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of making some charge for the provision of these services by the Family Court was actively considered by the previous government, as indicated in the Attorney-General's portfolio budget statement for 1995&hyphen;96. The proposal was also considered as part of the review of fees and charges in Commonwealth courts and tribunals commissioned by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While counselling and mediation are important, there needs to be an adequate contribution by those who use the services of all of our courts. In its 1994-95 annual report, the Family Court indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fifty per cent of all cases seen came to the (counselling service) on a voluntary basis to use the Court's primary (alternative) dispute resolution service without having filed any application at the Court.</PARA>
<PARA>These people, in particular, make no contribution to the running costs of the court. It is proposed that the provisions which relate to the waiver of other fees will extend to counselling and mediation fees so that those who cannot afford the cost of the service can continue to receive those services free of charge. Community based organisations also <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4022"> provide pro bono counselling services for those who are unable to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to assure the House that I and the government remain committed to encouraging the use of alterative dispute resolution services. The Family Court's counselling and mediation service is one of the oldest ADR services in existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not necessary, however, that services be provided without charge. There is extensive use made of community based services where moderate fees are charged. I expect that the services that the Family Court provides in this area will continue to be fully utilised providing that the fees charged are broadly in line with those charged in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The power to levy fees relates only to those services used on a voluntary basis. Where the Family Court orders or directs that counselling take place, no fee will be payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment does not, of course, impose any charges of itself and any such charges would have to be made by regulation. It is the government's intention to request the Governor-General to make regulations that would impose a fee equivalent to what we understand to be the average fee charged by the community based sector. This would be a fee of $40 per hour. No decision has yet been made on how the fee would be imposed, whether it would be an up&hyphen;front fee or collected at an hourly rate. We are currently examining with the Family Court the most practical way of effecting collection of such a fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government estimates that the fee will generate revenue of approximately $1.7 million in a full year. This initiative will make a significant contribution to the cost of providing voluntary counselling and mediation services in the Family Court rather than relying solely on community based services. It will also contribute to the achievement of the government's overall budget deficit reduction target. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (5.22 p.m.)&mdash;On behalf of the Treasurer (Mr Costello), I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the bill is to put in place arrangements for the provision of general revenue assistance to the states and territories in 1996&hyphen;97 and for the Commonwealth to commence making competition payments to the states and territories in 1997&hyphen;98. The bill also provides for the states and territories to make fiscal contributions to the Commonwealth in 1996&hyphen;97 by way of deductions from general revenue assistance. The contents of the bill are consistent with decisions taken at the 1996 Premiers Conference and related agreements with the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will amend the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994. The existing act covers the provision of general revenue assistance for 1995&hyphen;96 only, with interim arrangements for the continuation of payments for a maximum of six months. The bill extends the provisions of the existing act relating to the payment of general revenue assistance for a further 12 months and introduces new provisions in relation to competition payments and fiscal contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general revenue assistance to be appropriated by this bill is about $16.3 billion, or around 12 per cent of estimated Commonwealth outlays in 1996&hyphen;97. Accordingly, these payments constitute a significant element of the Commonwealth budget and have an important bearing on the spending and borrowing of the public sector as a whole. The states and territories are able to allocate the funds provided by the Commonwealth under this act according to their own budgetary priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996 Premiers Conference agreed that the states and territories will be provided with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4023"> real per capita growth in financial assistance grants in 1996&hyphen;97 and that the real per capita guarantee for financial assistance grants will be extended to 1998&hyphen;99. The real per capita guarantee remains conditional on a state meeting the terms of the agreement to implement the national competition policy and related reforms. In accordance with this agreement, the bill also contains provision for the commencement of competition payments to the states and territories in 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premiers Conference also agreed that the states and territories would contribute to the Commonwealth's deficit reduction program over the next three years. It was agreed that the states and territories will make payments to the Commonwealth of $619 million in 1996-97, $640 million in 1997-98 and $300 million in 1998-99, with the contribution of each state to be on a per capita basis. The need for these payments to be made by the states and territories will be reviewed annually at future Premiers Conferences in the light of the Commonwealth's fiscal position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has sought to provide states and territories with maximum flexibility concerning the method of payment. A state's share of the fiscal contribution can be paid by way of deductions from general revenue assistance, direct payments to the Commonwealth or a reduction in funding provided under a specific purpose grant. Provisions have been included in the bill for states' fiscal contributions in relation to 1996&hyphen;97 to be deducted from general revenue assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major part of the assistance provided under this bill is the provision to each state and territory of a share of the pool of financial assistance grants which is estimated to be about $15.5 billion in 1996-97. The 1996 Premiers Conference agreed that the distribution of this assistance should be in accordance with the amended per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The bill updates the per capita relativities in the act accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill authorises the payment of special revenue assistance to the states and territories in 1996-97 estimated at $438.4 million. Of this amount, $428.4 million relates to payments to New South Wales and Victoria <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under the guarantee arrangements associated with the Medicare agreements. The Commonwealth will fund $61.2 million of these payments and the residual will be funded from the financial assistance grants pool. The remaining special revenue assistance relates to special revenue assistance of $10 million to the Northern Territory which will also be funded from the financial assistance grants pool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Capital Territory will also receive $42.2 million from the Commonwealth in the form of transitional allowances and special fiscal needs. This payment is outside the scope of this bill and has been included in the appropriation bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996&hyphen;97, the Commonwealth will provide an estimated $384 million in identified arterial road grants to the states and territories. In accordance with the agreement reached at the 1996 Premiers Conference, in 1996&hyphen;97 two&hyphen;thirds of this amount will be distributed on the basis of the Commonwealth Grants Commission's relativities which underlie the distribution of financial assistance grants and one&hyphen;third will be distributed on the basis of historical shares.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>A bill was introduced into the Senate originally on 23 May 1996, and it was considered on 25 and 26 June 1996 when the Senate amended the bill. The government did not accept the amendments made by the Senate at that time and introduced a new bill in identical terms to the original bill in the House of Representatives on 27 June 1996. That bill was passed by the House on the same day and introduced into the Senate on 23 August. The bill was then considered by the Senate on 10 and 11 September 1996 and was passed by the Senate with 34 amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that the amendments made by the Senate reflect that, through consultation with the opposition, the Australian Democrats, the Greens and the Independents, substantial agreement was reached on the bill's provisions. The effects of the amendments made to the bill by the Senate are as follows: if the bill receives royal assent on or before 12 September 1996, the provisions reducing the size of regional councils will have effect for the 1996 round of regional council elections&mdash;for which a polling day of 12 October 1996 has been fixed; the reduction in the size of regional councils will not affect the legality of the election as a whole. Allowance has been made for the impact of the reduction on the regional council election rules. The provisions have been carefully drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and have been scrutinised by the government's legal advisers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister will be empowered, after consulting with the commission, to appoint additional persons to be members of any regional council if, in the minister's opinion, the number of members of the regional council is insufficient to enable the council to properly perform its functions. There will be a formal requirement that any report to the minister under subsection 141(3) of the act, covering the review of ATSIC's electoral systems, must include examination of ways in which the representation of district community groups on regional councils could be accommodated. If an elected zone commissioner is appointed as commission chairman, a further commissioner will be elected to represent the affected zones.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4035">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The composition of the commission is redefined to accommodate this new provision. Essentially, the commission is to comprise a chairman, who may or may not be chosen from the people elected as zone commissioners, plus 17 people elected to represent the various zones and one other person appointed by the minister. The arrangements covering the composition of the commission and government selection of its chairman will apply only until the day on which the minister appoints people as commissioners after they are elected following the 1999 round of regional council elections. At that time, the act will then provide for the commissioners to comprise only the 17 people elected to represent the various zones, and they will elect one of their number to be chairman.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the amendments that have been returned from the Senate. Today is a victory for indigenous people. Let us be under no misapprehension. These amendments do represent a backdown by the government from its initial hardline approach towards ATSIC. It has resulted in cross-party support for these amendments. I think there have been discussions in recent days of goodwill from all the parties. There has been cross-party support. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There have been a different emphasis and different points of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I think it is fair to say that this compromise which has been reached&mdash;and it is a compromise as there have been concessions by all parties, and that needs to be acknowledged&mdash;is the appropriate way to go. For the first time since the election of the Howard government, we have actually had the politics taken out of ATSIC and people of goodwill coming together and reaching, I think, results that can be justified on policy terms&mdash;results, frankly, that were sorely needed to send a signal to the community that it is time we had cross-party support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy is that some five months ago the first cabinet meeting of the new government was held, a cabinet meeting that considered proposals on the run from the minister&mdash;and I do not hold the minister responsible for this&mdash;who had not been properly briefed. From then on, it has been mayhem in terms of the indigenous community. Five months on, a number of the allegations that were raised by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program have been investigated. As a result, the crisis in ATSIC, the alleged corruption and the alleged mismanagement have failed to materialise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said at the time that the government's proposals were heavy-handed and over the top. Today vindicates what we said back then. The government has withdrawn the proposal for an administrator; it was never necessary. A proper reading of the act shows that the minister has adequate powers under the general directions section of the ATSIC Act to direct commissioners&mdash;he has adequate powers. An administrator is not required, for a number of reasons. The government has to be applauded for withdrawing that proposal. It should never have been there in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what these amendments have done: removed the administrator. It is a major concession that has to be acknowledged. We say it was never required. We would never have supported it, and we are glad that proposal is no longer there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further concession is that now there is cross-party support for the election of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4036"> ATSIC chair. This is enshrined in legislation to take effect after the 1999 ATSIC elections. For the first time, every major political party will vote for ATSIC commissioners to be able to elect their own chairperson, after the 1999 elections. That is the way forward. This is achieved by a sunset clause. It is a sunset clause that acknowledges there has been a change of government; that there needs to be a cooling-off period. It is a sunset clause that acknowledges that the minister&mdash;and he did this in his second reading speech today&mdash;will welcome the input of opposition parties on the appointment of the next ATSIC chair and is also inviting indigenous people to consult with him on the issue, with there being no veto on consultation, which is the way it should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time the Liberal and National parties are voting for the principle of an elected chair for ATSIC. That is why we support that amendment. There are 94 Liberal&hyphen;National Party members in this House and 37 senators in the other House. In 1993, when the original proposal went through, it was opposed by the then opposition, the Liberal&hyphen;National Party. The government introduced these amendments. So that is a concession&mdash;but it is a concession we welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, I think there has been a compromise on the part of the opposition because it is questionable whether this proposal could have got through without cross-party support. We will never know. It should not have got through in a partisan way. The benefit of this package is that is it has cross-party support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that there are one or two in this place and in the other place that might not be happy with this. My preference is for an elected chair now. However, I say to those listening that this is a better way, because what we now have is cross-party support. Whoever wins the next federal election, we now have cross-party support for the principle. That is better than winning one way or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is a benefit for ATSIC. The worst thing that could have happened was for an elected chair to be involved in a long&hyphen;running argument with this government over <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the next three years. I know there are some people who are worried about that proposal. But I say, in the current climate, in the current circumstances, that is a reasonable compromise&mdash;and the Labor Party are prepared to put their name to that compromise. That is why we support this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in fairness to the government, they have also come to the party as well. For the first time they have given up and conceded that in three years time there will be a fully elected chair for ATSIC, as there should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the regional council reductions, people need to understand that, again, there have been concessions on both sides. When the bill was first introduced, we opposed the wholesale reductions in terms of the size of regional councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I must say, in fairness to the government, that their proposal arose at least out of a policy document&mdash;a review of the 1993 elections. This was a document of March 1995 that suggested this very reduction&mdash;a document where there was a panel comprising the commission chairperson, Lois O'Donoghue; Trevor Willson of the Australian Electoral Commission; Kenneth Wyatt, the Acting Manager of Aboriginal Education from the Western Australian Education Department, an Aboriginal person appointed by the then minister; Mr George Trevorrow, Coordinator of Camp Coorong, Meningie, South Australia, an Aboriginal person appointed by the minister; and Mr Doug White, Acting General Manager of Australian Land Surveying and Land Information Group. So at least that proposal emanated from a review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our objection at the time was that there had been a reduction in the number of regional councils from 60 to 36 after the 1990 election, and that had resulted in the number of regional councillors being lowered from 809 to 593. This current proposal will result in 593 being reduced to 397. We felt that it was a drastic reduction because it was only based on a mathematical formula. Our consultation showed that some remote communities, some distinct groups might miss out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The compromise has been&mdash;and it has been put in legislation&mdash;that the minister now has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4037"> the power, in consultation with the commission, to appoint additional regional councillors if the case can be made out. One of the amendments that was passed through the Senate this morning that we have before us today is that there will be a review after the current round of elections to look at ways of looking after those remote communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other problem we faced was that there were $8.2 million of budget savings allocated on the reduction of regional councillors. If that proposal were not compromised by us, that $8.2 million would have come out of programs. I believe that this is a sensible compromise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the atmosphere of goodwill in which these amendments are going through, if a genuine case were made out to the commission and the minister, the minister will act. The minister has been acting in goodwill. He is not the centre of my discontent in relation to some of these issues. I said at the time that the cabinet, in its original decision, had handed the minister a poisoned chalice. That is exactly what has transpired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have no problem with that amendment and support it because it goes further than the review of electoral systems of March 1995 recommended to protect remote communities. So let us not say that there was no consultation; there has been. People have been listened to and there has been a response. We referred to it as a safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have no hesitation in supporting the proposals that are before the parliament. I repeat the offer that I have made from day one since I have been shadow minister: this portfolio should be above politics; the Labor Party is prepared, through consultation with indigenous communities, indigenous people and all interested parties, to entertain reasonable, constructive amendments. We do not want the continuation of an ATSIC bashing exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The colour of someone's skin should not be the basis of a policy for an individual or a political party, and it should not be something that individuals or political parties take advantage of. I feel that in recent times there has been a new, subtle form of McCarthyism. These proposals provide an appropriate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mechanism that sends a signal&mdash;a signal responding to two eloquent speeches by the Governor&hyphen;General. The first was at the Vincent Lingiarri lecture delivered on 22 August 1996, which I had the honour and privilege to attend as a representative of the Labor Party. It was the 30th anniversary of the Wave Hill walk&hyphen;off. The second was a speech on 4 September in Melbourne on the occasion of a national conference of the Council for Homeless Persons, where the Governor&hyphen;General challenged, in the first instance, the parliament to recommit itself to reconciliation. I think these amendments go a long way towards doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also show that the Senate&mdash;the major parties, the Labor Party, the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents&mdash;will not countenance being run over roughshod. In this instance it has acted as a filter to produce a better bill for this House to consider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of people across the spectrum deserve credit. There will be some criticism, which is fine because sometimes you need to make hard decisions in the interests of everyone. Sometimes you have to take a backward step to take two forward steps in the long run. That is what these amendments do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would have been quite easy for the government to keep its head in the sand, but then 80 per cent of this bill which originally had the unanimous support of both sides of the House would have been discarded. It also shows that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) was wrong on the last occasion not to deal with the Senate bill because we could have utilised 80 per cent of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party does not back away from being associated with this package and endorsing it. We have made some concessions and we do not apologise to anyone for that. In the long run, we have attempted to take ATSIC and indigenous people out of the line of fire. There is no excuse for the continued attack on ATSIC. It is put up or shut up time. What happened before is not the way to run a sensitive portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments are an acknowledgment by both sides of the sunset clause. They are a concession by us to the government that it won the last election, that the ball game has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4038"> changed. In the current climate, in return for consultation, we have agreed that there will be an elected chair in 1999. I think that is a sensible compromise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the minister and those involved. I do not commend all members of the government because some of them who were pretty outspoken in the early days are pretty silent now. They have had five months. The reason there has been a bit of a backdown is that commonsense has prevailed. The people who made all sorts of allegations have not been able to deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wholeheartedly support the compromise. It recognises that there is a bit of a way to go in this portfolio. As I go through each of these proposals, I reject the argument that it represents an attack on self&hyphen;determination. Taking away the administrator is not an attack on self&hyphen;determination; it is a recognition of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A final acknowledgment by every major political party that in 1999 there will be an elected chair of ATSIC is a recognition of self&hyphen;determination, and that is an advanced step. Acting on a report from ATSIC in relation to regional councils is also consistent with the principle of self-determination. We have improved on that recommendation. I thank the House for its indulgence.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Kalgoorlie)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.52 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I have the utmost admiration for the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the member for Banks (Mr Melham). He is able to come into this House and sound entirely reasonable even when uttering the most outrageous hyperbole. I say in all sincerity to the member for Banks: undoubtedly you are headed for the High Court, sir.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we now have in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill is clearly an improvement on the situation as it was, but it has a long way to go and in many ways it has simply ducked the hard issues. Let us look at the issue of self-determination. I believe that, with the money that comes from taxpayers, the government had every right to appoint a chairman. The compromise that has been reached is that the government will appoint the chairman on this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> occasion but after the next election the ATSIC councils will elect their own chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a belated recognition by the Labor Party that, had they had an election this time, Mr Robinson would have probably been elected. The Labor Party realised belatedly that that would have been a disaster. So it is not so much a triumph, as the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) would say, but a recognition by the Labor Party that, had ATSIC been allowed to elect its chairman this time, the outcome would have been outrageous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does not go to the heart of the problem, and that is the lack of resources going to Aboriginal people&mdash;the fact that the funds are simply not getting down to them despite the enormous budget that ATSIC is responsible for. The shadow minister talked about looking after remote communities. ATSIC has itself determined that it wants to fund on a per capita basis, which will see funds go from remote communities to cities. I would say, and my views have been endorsed overwhelmingly by the Aboriginal people whom I represent, that those Aboriginals who have gone to the city have voted with their feet, they have joined the mainstream, and they should not be part of ATSIC funding. There are more Aboriginal people in the western suburbs of Sydney than there are in my electorate. They should be getting their funds from the mainstream, both state and federal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this decision is not reversed, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) seems unwilling to do it because of this myth about self-determination, remote areas will have their funding cut by 20 per cent a year for five years. So in five years time their funding will be 20 per cent of what it is now. There will be a massive flow of people from remote areas, which will impact on country towns, including those in my electorate&mdash;Kalgoorlie, Port Hedland, probably Geraldton, Carnarvon, Derby, Broome, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not conducive to Aboriginal welfare and certainly not in line with what Aboriginal people want, but it will be the inevitable consequence of allowing ATSIC to behave in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4039"> this way. You have only to look at the number of people who vote in ATSIC elections. It is just nonsense to suggest that ATSIC is the voice of Aboriginal people. I can tell the House that in my electorate ATSIC is universally detested. Aboriginal people have no regard for ATSIC and see it as a corrupt institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have talk of reconciliation. An Aboriginal bloke said to me recently, `What's this reconciliation? It's about the past, isn't it? We've got to think about the future.' The truth is that 200 years ago this was a largely uninhabited land. There were about 200,000 Aboriginal people on the entire continent. Sooner or later someone was going to come here. A great many Aboriginal people recognise that they were lucky it was us and not just about anyone else. They know, either intellectually or intuitively, that they would be much worse off had this country been colonised by other people, and quite clearly it would have been colonised by other people. It is just a nonsense to go on with this guilt which people try to engender and is being engendered by this so-called reconciliation council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An outcome of this is the inquiry by Judge Wilson, clearly in his dotage&mdash;I believe he has been there for a long time&mdash;into the effect of Aboriginal people being separated from their parents. There were anomalies that occurred. Of course there were, but overwhelmingly had a lot of those people not been separated from their parents they would simply have died. Would all these bleeding hearts who now want compensation consider this to be preferable? Those who became wards of the state invariably were fed, clothed and educated, and they have now disproportionately formed the ranks of the leaders in the Aboriginal communities. I know many of them recognise this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a stacked inquiry. The ALS got poor old Judge Wilson up there and they have been selecting the people to go ahead and protest. I could give them a list of Aboriginal people who either would not appear before them or, if they did, could considerably embarrass them. When we get the recommendations from Wilson&mdash;and one can see what they are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to be&mdash;they have to be looked at very carefully indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that this bill does not address Aboriginal advancement. That is one of my complaints about it. Aboriginal advancement depends on housing, hygiene, health, education, training and employment. It is not relevant to land. It is interesting to note that those Aboriginals who have the highest standard of living, the longest lifespan and the best wellbeing are those who have been separated from land the longest. It is simply not true to say that land plays this overwhelming part in culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing the forcing of our view of culture on Aboriginal people. We are told that Aboriginal people have this view of the extended family, that that is Aboriginal culture. It is in fact the poverty culture. Any group in society living in poverty works on an extended family basis. It is commonsense. It makes it economically easier to survive. But what we are doing, of course, is entrenching poverty culture and calling it Aboriginal culture. It is not, I would suggest, good for Aboriginal advancement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the issues I have mentioned, you will see that if you miss out on just one of those the whole thing collapses, and there is nothing in this ATSIC bill which is going to address that. I am aware of just one school in my electorate&mdash;Halls Creek&mdash;where I think the level of education is appalling. Internal documents from the department of education show that in a grade 3 maths test recently given to grade 4 maths students there was about a 12 per cent pass rate. The big reason for failure was that they could not read the questions. Illiteracy is appalling and it is increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no Aboriginal advancement unless we attend to education. Quite clearly, education is not the answer, but without it there is no answer. I saw in the paper yesterday the commissioner for reconciliation suggesting that Colin Barnett's recommendation was outrageous. Mr Barnett is a man in the Western Australian government for whom I have very little time. He said that we must look at providing facilities where Aboriginal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4040"> kids can be taken so that they can attend school regularly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not particularly new. I have been asked by Aboriginal people for this for ages. They see a need for the same facility, particularly in some of the remote communities. An Aboriginal woman said to me recently, `Our kids aren't getting an education because they don't go to school, and you don't care. If they were white kids, you'd care and you'd make them go to school, but because they're black you don't care.' I had to explain to her that we make the white kids go to school not because we do not care but because that is the law and they are going to school. We are so frightened of their culture that we did not enforce it. She told me how silly this was and that it was Aboriginal kids that needed an education. She is absolutely right. But we have allowed football matches to become cultural events. Kids go to school so rarely in many cases that they cannot get an education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bleeding hearts&mdash;and the Labor Party put this little beauty through&mdash;took the Abstudy money off the schools and gave it to the individual. In most cases this money has not gone to education. Some of it has gone to buying furniture in houses. That is at least better than other occasions when it has simply gone to grog. But in any case the money was for education, and it does not impinge on self&hyphen;determination to insist that money granted for education purposes is used for education. If that money were returned to schools and paid pro rata on the number of days that kids attended school, you would see an improvement in education and school attendance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at our gaols, you will see that they are disproportionately filled with Aboriginal people and with Aboriginal people who cannot read or write. A very good friend of mine has recently been in gaol in Kalgoorlie. While there, he was conducting voluntary classes for Aboriginals which were very well attended. Aboriginal people in gaol were dead keen to learn to read and write. If the bleeding hearts society do not realise it, the Aborigines realise that they have to be fluent in English if they are going to survive in society today. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He told me that many of the Aboriginal people who came to him could not tell the time. There is a myth that Aboriginals have no regard for time. The fact is that they could not tell the time; they could not read an analog watch. If you have not been told how to read an analog watch, no-one would know. It is an indictment of the situation. We spend a lot of money on primary school education. If kids get through primary school and cannot read, high school will not teach them; yet there is nothing in this bill and ATSIC will not address these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I think it is time that ATSIC was swept away and we had it returned to a department with ministerial responsibility so that we can at least hold someone in the government responsible for the outrages that are occurring in the lack of real benefit that is flowing to Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on the subject of the member for Oxley, I would like to talk about a question that was asked in the parliament today. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) jumped up and said that the question was out of order, because this bill was coming to town. He was then supported by the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Dr Wooldridge). They both knew that was not the case. There was nothing in the bill at all that had any bearing on the question that the member had raised. That question should have been ruled in order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not blame the Acting Speaker&mdash;that would be uncharitable&mdash;but clearly the member for Hotham and the minister representing the minister knew that it was simply a way of ducking the question. I certainly do not think it did the member for Hotham any credit. Frankly, it was certainly none of his business and I thought his intervention was totally unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the member is right: the requirements for a commissioner for ATSIC do seem to be different from those for a commissioner for the Torres Strait Islander Commission or for a member of parliament. It is something that needs to be addressed. I am not saying that we should have the same <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4041"> standards if we are going to maintain ATSIC. With the decline of Aboriginal law, a term in gaol has become a rite of passage for many young Aboriginal people, and many of them become leaders in their community later on. I think it would be counterproductive to exclude them simply because of a gaol sentence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are some offences which I clearly think should exclude them. Things such as rape and fraud should clearly exclude them. But, with the way it is at the moment, as long as it is two years since they were in gaol or two years since they were convicted, they can serve on that board. That is simply not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting this bill through the parliament is an advance on what we had. Thanks to the Labor Party, the Greens and the Australian Democrats, it is not as good as it should have been. In any case, if we have genuine interest in Aboriginal advancement, we are going to have to revisit this and address amendments to the ATSIC bill in much more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall being asked in this place many years ago whether there was any progress in Aboriginal advancement. I think the answer is this: if you are looking for the things we have done to improve the lot of Aboriginal people, the improvements have been very marginal indeed. In other words, the end result for Aboriginal people has been very marginal. But if you are looking at placating the affluent urban guilt brigade then we have done a marvellous job. We have now got to the backlash stage where people are saying, `After all this money, there is no advancement,' and we blame the victim. I think there has been far too much of blaming the victim. The member for Banks talks about removing the right to put an administrator in. We have the right to put administrators into very large companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A registrar of Aboriginal associations can put an administrator into Aboriginal communities. He does not even have to show cause why he should do that. I know of some occasions where this power has been used politically. It will be used politically in the future. Once again we are removing ATSIC. But we are blaming the victim and allowing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> things to happen to the victim which we must protect ATSIC from. How absurd!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are several things that are holding back Aboriginal advancement. One is the concept of white guilt and the other is the concept of black shame. They are both concepts that should be swept away. While we continue to blame the victim, there is going to be no real advancement. We see time after time ATSIC giving grants to communities without any guidance at all, then sitting back and waiting for the community to fall down, and then coming in with the big stick and putting in grant controls and whatnot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ATSIC seems only able to administer crisis management. This organisation now has in Canberra twice the number of people that were in the old department. Members of this House will recall that one of the reasons we were told we had to have ATSIC was that the old department of Aboriginal affairs was top heavy and had too many bureaucrats in Canberra. That was always going to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this bill. It is an improvement. It is a pity that some of the worthwhile amendments were not accepted by the Senate. What we have, as the member for Banks says, is 80 per cent of what we could have had. I guess 80 per cent is better than nothing.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am proud to stand here as the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works and, for the first time in my parliamentary career, present the report of the Public Works Committee, in this case covering January to December 1995. There are&mdash;and it is significant that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, are in the chair&mdash;some injustices about political life, as all of us in this profession know. One of those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4042"> injustices is that I should stand here presenting this report which covers a very busy period, during which time the committee was chaired by you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I believe I would not be doing Mr Hollis, the parliament or the former government justice if I did not acknowledge the role Mr Hollis played in his almost 10 years as chairman of this committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it would be fair to say that no other committee of the parliament has been as busy or assiduous in its task as has the Public Works Committee under the chairmanship of Mr Hollis, the member for Throsby. The parliament should note that during 1995 the committee met on 98 occasions, conducted 32 public hearings and made 40 inspections. If you look at that workload and spread it over the year, it means that the committee would have met on two occasions in every week of the year&mdash;every parliamentarian knows how demanding that is in terms of the pressures of parliamentary time&mdash;and that the committee conducted a public hearing in every non&hyphen;sitting week. Clearly, the logistics did not quite work out like that, but it is fair to say that under the member for Throsby's chairmanship this was a very active committee and 1995 was a very busy year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members who are familiar with the committee will know, this committee travels extensively. This committee does not source references from within the committee. Committee members do not determine the committee's workload. The committee is unique in that its workload is always determined by sources outside of the parliament that are involved in building programs or other extension programs requiring public works intervention. For that reason, the committee's workload is frequently unpredictable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee met at locations throughout Australia&mdash;not just in capital cities and major regional centres where one would expect the bulk of Commonwealth public works proposals to be constructed. We ranged far and wide. We went to remote locations such as Christmas Island, Maralinga, Ceduna, Puckapunyal and Canungra, to name a few. We presented 29 reports on projects estimated to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cost in excess of $1.5 billion. It was a busy year in comparison with previous years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 the committee presented 14 reports on $320 million worth of projects. In 1993 it presented nine reports on works costing $252 million. In 1992 it presented 21 reports on $1.4 billion worth of projects. In short, the parliament should be aware that 1995 was one of the busiest and most productive years in the committee's long history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament, and the people of Australia, were well served by the committee, whose role is essentially that of a watchdog of Commonwealth public works. The committee examined projects wide ranging in purpose and cost. In terms of their stated purposes, they ranged from defence projects, to office accommodation, law courts, CSIRO laboratories, overseas works, soil decontamination and defence housing. In terms of cost, these range from $6.8 billion for a Defence Housing Authority project at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> to a massive $264 million to be spent in the Northern Territory on stage 2 of the Army Presence in the North project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Defence housing projects costing more than $232 million were examined during the year. They involved housing developments at Canungra, Westernport, Darwin and Townsville. The committee also reported on overseas public works estimated to cost $74 million. I should mention here that the act prevents the committee from formally meeting and conducting official business overseas. This, in effect, means that a very important component of the committee's operational procedure&mdash;site inspections&mdash;is, understandably, not possible at present. Instead, the Overseas Property Group provides us with a video of proposed new sites or existing conditions and a model of what is proposed to be constructed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee is therefore being asked to report on multi&hyphen;million dollar projects with what is sometimes incomplete or inadequate information. We have attempted to get around this unsatisfactory arrangement by undertaking inspections individually whilst in the various locations on other parliamentary business or at our own expense.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4043">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the year, themes and issues common to a number of inquiries emerged and appropriate recommendations were made in reports. These included the need for sponsors and designers to adopt more stringent energy conservation measures. The committee's concerns have resulted in a review of energy standards. The committee continued to insist that solar hot water heaters be provided in houses being constructed by the Defence Housing Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a number of instances environmental clearances were not obtained before projects were referred to the committee. This resulted, in one instance, in a proposed site being declared unsuitable for development due to the presence of an endangered species, the earless dragon lizard. The result was that a new site had to be found and additional expenditure of $650,000 was incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One area of concern is soil or site contamination. The rehabilitation of the former British nuclear test site at Maralinga in South Australia is a case in point. The cost estimate was $104 million. I am happy to say that about half the cost will be borne by the British taxpayers. As is our practice, we spent a day at Maralinga during which the Commonwealth's experts in nuclear test site remediation showed us the extent of the problem and the ways in which contaminated soil and test detritus will be made safe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A newly developed technique which will encapsulate highly radioactive material such as plutonium in a substance resembling glass or granite will be used in the project. The technique is called in situ vitrification and involves enormous amounts of electricity being transmitted through two electrodes into the soil. Of course, this being newly developed technology, the committee adopted a cautious approach to it and recommended that before full&hyphen;scale in situ vitrification commences, smaller scale trials be undertaken to provide assurances that encapsulation and mixing meet prescribed standards. This has now been successfully undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other projects involving remediation or uncertainty were the site selected for a housing development in Darwin and the need for the site of the Australian embassy complex in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Hanoi and the site of the new high commission in Port Moresby to be declared free of unexploded ordnance. The cost of projects continues to be a matter of concern, especially professional fees for consultancies and considerable sums set aside for contingencies. The committee continued to question the proportion of project costs allocated for these areas. This, of course, will also continue to be the committee's practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report gives well&hyphen;deserved credit to the untiring efforts of two former members of the committee, Mr Ray Braithwaite and Mr Ben Humphreys who, throughout the past year and previous years, continued to question sponsors and designers about mechanisms designed to deter collusive tendering and guarantee the payment of subcontractors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latter is now covered by Australian standard 2124 which should serve as the basis of any tender documents. On the question of collusive tendering, otherwise known as anti&hyphen;competitive conduct, we know that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found evidence of it in the Brisbane concrete market and has imposed heavy fines. This will hopefully serve as a salutary lesson to the construction industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report acknowledges the leadership of the former chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Throsby, during 1995 which marked the tenth year of his appointment to the committee and his eighth year as chairman. I am sure the House recognises, as I said in my opening remarks, that under his leadership the public works committee has earned an enviable reputation as a watchdog and has maintained its long tradition of a bipartisan approach to all inquiries. The honourable member for Throsby has been scrupulously fair in his decisions and tenacious in his questioning of all who appear before the committee at public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report acknowledges the efforts of a number of members whose terms of office have expired: Mr Ray Braithwaite, Mr Russ Gorman, Mr Ben Humphreys and Senator Bryant Burns. They brought to the committee a wide range of backgrounds and interests, many of which were reflected during the public examination of witnesses and in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4044"> committee's reports. Again, the parliament was well served. The committee secretariat under the leadership of Peter Roberts also deserved recognition and thanks. As I mentioned earlier, last year was characterised by a record number of references and reports, and attendant travel; inspections; public hearings; report considerations; private meetings and briefings which were required to be organised. All members of the secretariat rose to the challenge and achieved the desired results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should add that while not relevant to the period covered by the report, the parliament should be aware that Mr Roberts has subsequently indicated his resignation from the committee and so has Ms Denahy who was also a member of the secretariat staff. While this will be more widely covered in next year's report, I know the parliament will recognise how well both those members served the committee. The role of secretary of the committee has now been assumed by Mr Bjarne Nordin, who is a well&hyphen;known parliamentary officer. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government's reform program for higher education represents the end of a great Australian dream. It is often said in this country that our great national dream is reflected in home ownership. I have a different point of view. The great Australian dream is better reflected by access to higher education, access to university, particularly for those families where the entrant to a university is the first person in that family, the first generation, to undertake a higher education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know these things because I lived part of that dream in the housing department suburb of Green Valley in the 1960s. My sisters, my friends and young people in the street&mdash;not just me&mdash;knew that their best form of advancement in life, their social mobility, was to gain access to a university. For so many of them their opportunity, coming out of the 1960s, was available in the 1970s because the Whitlam government abolished the up&hyphen;front tertiary fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know these things about the university sector in the 1990s because I represent the electorate of Werriwa where, again, the great Australian dream in that electorate is for the first generation of young people in a family to gain access to a university education. This government's policy, its package of higher education reforms, reflects the death of that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4045"> great Australian dream, that great Australian aspiration. It is the birth of two&hyphen;tier higher education in this country. There is one system for the rich, where they can buy out a university education, a university place, if they do not do well enough in their HSC. It is the abolition of the principle that it is merit that gives people open and free access to universities, not their wealth, not their private income. It is the birth of a two&hyphen;tier higher education system: one for the rich and one for the poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's policy also, sadly enough, represents the death of the clever country. It represents the death of Australia's aspirations to be a clever country. It is, unfortunately, the birth of the not so clever country or, as one of my colleagues put it to me the other day, the birth of the Amanda Vanstone `dumb as dog dirt' country. That is what we are effectively seeing in Australia as a product of this government's university reforms. It is part of the Howard government's systematic attack on the principle of universality. It is part of this government's assault on the principle of universality, its erosion of the guiding principles of universality and collective responsibility in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see this in health with the emergence of a two&hyphen;tier health system: private health insurance for the rich and the running down of public hospital access for the not so rich. We see it in the higher education system: up&hyphen;front fees which can be bought out by the wealthy and affluent parts of the Australian community. For those not so wealthy, not so fortunate in their life, there is a denial of access, an abolition of the principle of merit across the university sector and the creeping Americanisation, the creeping emergence of a principle based on wealth and privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am interested to note the presence in the chamber of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott). I understand that in recent times he has been addressing students at his alma mater and mine, the University of Sydney, about these reforms. I understand that he put to those students an interesting principle, an interesting redefinition of equity in Australia&mdash;that is, the idea that the real test of equity in the university <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sector is what happens to you after you leave university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a very interesting understanding of equity because the great equity challenge, the great hurdle to jump, in higher education if you come from a working class family is to get in, to gain access to university. It is the entry point equity that matters, not so much what happens after that with the recovery of HECS payments. The equity principle in higher education must always be the point of entry. That is where the parliamentary secretary in those remarks at the University of Sydney in recent months is fundamentally wrong and fundamentally flawed in his thinking. Equity at the point of access is the key principle of fairness. It must be, because without equity at the point of access there is no social mobility; there is no great Australian dream and great Australian aspiration for entry to the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, unless we have a situation where the hurdle to be jumped at entry point is set low by government, we will move to a less equitable and much less fair higher education system. This government is clearly lifting the hurdle on the entry point because it is increasing the disincentive that students face in their earning capacity and their capacity to pay future HECS, because that is the choice. People from the electorate of Warringah or from the electorate of Bennelong or from electorates on the North Shore of Sydney might not understand this but, when parents sit around with their children at the end of year 12 and discuss their future prospects, this is the question they ask: `Is my son or daughter better off going to university and forgoing earnings in the short term, or is my son or daughter better off going there and having to pay HECS later on?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you increase the HECS payment later on, have earlier and higher payment of HECS, you place the disincentive on that family table. You place the disincentive at the forefront of those family discussions. You lift the hurdle on their access to higher education. That is what happens. I know those things because my family had that discussion. If my family had had to face the prospect of higher and earlier HECS payments, they would have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4046"> said, `Don't forgo the revenue in the short term.' For their son and daughter there would have been no university access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sad, unfortunate and barbaric thing about these reforms&mdash;to increase the disincentive, to lift the hurdle and increase the obstacles to those families as they discuss their revenue stream, to say that they have to pay back more HECS, earlier after the students leave university, having already out of their living standards forgone the earning capacity of getting a job straight out of high school, instead of going on to the university sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the very sad thing, and it is reflected in some of the recent comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He does not understand; a man from Wollstonecraft would not understand these things. He would not have heard those discussions in any part of his electorate in his 22 years in the federal parliament. And it is reflected in what he said to the Liberal Party conference at St Marys&mdash;out there knowing that there would be a by&hyphen;election for Lindsay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what he had to say, and he repeated it in his personal explanation on Monday. He is talking about the Labor Party:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a fraud on the working people of this country, because what it basically did was to say to the people . . . we are quite happy to take your taxes to pay for university education that will enrich another section of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>How totally wrong about the Labor Party philosophy on higher education. Our philosophy is to take money from a progressive tax system, to have a low threshold, a low hurdle for students to jump in terms of their HECS payments, and to make available access to the university sector that gives those working class families, for the first generation in that family, access to a university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not in the business of taking from one sector of the community and giving it away to the rich. Of course, you need entry to university to establish the social mobility. What this Prime Minister is about is hurting people more than helping them. He is trying to make a public spectacle and a public virtue of hurting people in public life. He is trying to say to the Liberal Party conference at St <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Marys that he is taking things away from people who do not deserve them: he is taking things away from students&mdash;their rights, their entitlements, their access&mdash;and working&hyphen;class people should be happy about that. He is playing the politics of hurt, a deliberate strategy of doing things to hurt people instead of trying to help them, and then trying to make a virtue of that hurt, trying to make a virtue of taking things away from people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that you need a progressive tax system. You need a low hurdle on HECS to give working class people and their children their access to university. And you don't take things away from them. That is the act of giving; that is the act of providing out of universality, because then you have the university education&mdash;their best chance to progress themselves to get a good job, to be socially mobile, to do better than their parents and their grandparents could have done in life. That is the policy of giving. That is the policy of provision in the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this talk about, `We're taking it away from them because they might earn a few quid later on in life'&mdash;how barbaric, how sad. What a terrible thing for a Prime Minister of this country to say. That has got to be the most disgusting thing I have ever heard in public life, and he stands condemned for saying it. We are not in the business of taking things away from people who might become socially mobile; we are in the business of giving them their opportunity in life. And that is what the Australian Labor Party stands for. So this Prime Minister&mdash;it's a disgusting thing to suggest those things to the Liberal Party at St Marys, and he stands condemned accordingly.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reason you need universality in the university sector and to maintain a collective responsibility is the externalities. There is a very clear argument to say that this is an item of social merit. It is a social good, which does not bring benefits just for the individual and they accrue those benefits later in their working life; it is an item of social merit that brings good to us all. That is why we need a collective responsibility&mdash;because we all share in the collective benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The higher education sector in Australia is an important part of regional and economic development. It helps make us a clever country and, as Australia grows and its economy prospers, there are trickle down and multiplier effects for the entire community out of that. It cannot be denied that we are all better off by Australia being a clever country, we are all better off by Australia having a successful, thriving university sector. That, I would have thought, was self-evident. That is why you need to maintain collective responsibility in the university sector: because we are all collectively beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those arguments about economic development have been well established by theorists such as Michael Porter to Robert Reich. I would have thought that every single economist in the Western world&mdash;it is so hard to get economists to agree on things&mdash;would agree about the principle that higher education brings a collective benefit to society in terms <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of economic growth and prosperity. That very clearly is the basic externality of the university sector that indicates a collective responsibility. It is also a basic principle for the fairness, for the decency, of our society that we maintain fair and reasonable access to learning&mdash;learning itself, the thing that enriches people in their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our aspirations in the Labor Party, I am sure you would agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, rely so much on the ideas of tolerance, learning, progressive thought: people becoming more enlightened as a product of their learning and, as they become more enlightened, to be more tolerant, progressive and caring as participants in society. Universities do those things; they do those things so importantly. They have done so since their very formation centuries ago. To close down access to the power of enlightenment is a very sad thing for a government and public policy to engage in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I know these things and speak about them with passion not just because of my personal circumstances but because I know the importance of the University of Western Sydney for my constituents&mdash;a great, inspiring and essential facility in our part of Sydney. I went to the University of Sydney, as did the member for Warringah. I do not know his personal circumstances, but in my case it was because the Whitlam government abolished fees. But I also had to travel three hours a day to get to that university because there was none within 20 kilometres of my home in Liverpool. There was no university within easy reach. The University of Sydney was the closest university to my home in Liverpool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the case now, of course, for people in Liverpool and Campbelltown in my electorate because they have the University of Western Sydney. It was a recommendation, justly enough, of the Whitlam government. They put in place the planning process that ultimately led to the emergence of the University of Western Sydney, but not before the Howard treasurership and the Fraser government abandoned those particular plans. It was the Fraser government with John Howard as Treasurer that said, `You should not be building an extra university in Sydney', where the people have moved to, where the great <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4048"> body of the population live in greater western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Prime Minister on these matters has form. It was the recommendation of the Whitlam government to establish a University of Western Sydney. Gough set aside the land for the Macarthur campus that stands so finely today on the border of my electorate as an inspiration for young people wanting to advance themselves through higher education. Those plans were abolished by the Fraser government with John Howard as its Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then again, it was left to Labor in the 1980s, through the Hawke government and the Unsworth government in New South Wales, to resurrect the Whitlam vision of a university in western Sydney. They built the University of Western Sydney so that a young person growing up in Green Valley, Liverpool, or in public housing in Campbelltown today does not have to go to Kensington, Redfern or Ryde for the New South Wales, Sydney, or Macquarie universities. They have a university within their own region&mdash;within easy reach of where they live&mdash;so that access, so that travelling time and so that a loss of studying time is not an obstacle to their best opportunity to have access to university. That is a very important reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that the Labor government, under both Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, was doing so well was to fund up the growth of the University of Western Sydney, not to leave it as some small institution sitting out there without the capacity to service the great growth region of Sydney. They funded up the growth through the funding principle of redistribution. The very sad thing about legislation like this and the plans that have been announced by the government is that the growth funding has been lost. The growth funding has been taken away from the University of Western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This just typifies our struggle, the lifelong struggle of people in western Sydney, to get a funding share matching the population share&mdash;not to ask for anything more, just simply to ask for things that the rest of Sydney already have, not only in universities but in health. They are the two central institu tions in which we struggle so hard to try to get our fair share of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In health, the medical profession is always trying to knock us over. Weak-kneed and vain ministers at state level, Labor and Liberal, do not help at all.</PARA>

I think that is the attitude being echoed by this government as it takes away the growth funding for the University of Western Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe sincerely it is the attitude that is echoed by university elitists like Professor Gavin Brown at the University of Sydney and Professor Alan Gilbert at the University of Melbourne&mdash;the VCs who back in this government's reform, who back in the abolition of growth funding and who back in the principle of a university sector based on wealth instead of merit. We stand against those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We stand against Amanda Vanstone; we stand against the member for Warringah; we stand against his Prime Minister; and we stand against the Alan Gilberts, the Gavin Browns and the medical professionals. We will argue against anyone else&mdash;whether they are Labor, Liberal, Labor Council, Andrew Refshauge or the university sector&mdash;who say that people in western Sydney do not deserve their fair share of funding. We are not asking for any more than other parts of Sydney; we are just asking for the same. That is, if you have half of Sydney's population in western Sydney, that is where half of your heath and university resources should be allocated. This government is sending us backwards in the higher education sector because they are abolishing the five per cent growth funding for the coming financial year and a 15 per cent cut over a three-year period.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4049">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> some time ago&mdash;on 30 May&mdash;where the newly elected Liberal members of parliament from western Sydney had met with Senator Vanstone and urged her not to cut funding to the University of Western Sydney because of its special needs. I have outlined those needs, I would have thought, fairly comprehensively this evening. They went on to state their argument&mdash;I am talking about the former member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, who has now met her maker and fate in a political sense; the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett); and also the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron). They staked their political reputation on this. Well, they have failed. They can go back to their electorates. I am sure that the former member for Lindsay goes back to Penrith tonight, knowing that she has failed the young people in her electorate who want growth funding for the University of Western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They put their reputations on the line when they lobbied Senator Vanstone and they have failed comprehensively. They have failed to do the things that Labor was doing so well; they have failed to do the things that people in western Sydney expect&mdash;not as a privilege but as a basic right&mdash;as an essential of political representation. That is, to stand up and get their fair share of funding for universities, for health, for transport and for employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Jackie Kelly has failed comprehensively. As the Liberal Party so fulsomely endorses individual employment contracts, I would urge the people of Lindsay not to renew her contract for proven inability to getting the university funding share that they deserve in Penrith and the rest of the region. If you want to apply a basic test that the Liberal Party are so enthusiastic about, she is a gross failure not only in universities but across all the sectors&mdash;child care, employment funding and access to basic facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government needs a road map to find western Sydney, let alone do the right thing on university funding. I will tell you what: they stand condemned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This higher education funding bill was originally introduced by the previous government. It was not debated and passed and it lapsed at the time of the last election. The fact that the new government is simply re-presenting this bill shows how much remains the same in higher education, despite all the Chicken Little calls that are coming from members opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one picks up some press clippings, it is interesting to look at some of the headlines&mdash;`Chain reaction on tax', which reads `Four students protesting against the Federal Government's proposed graduate tax chained themselves to the doors of Melbourne University's Wilson Hall today'; and `Students plan to create "havoc"', which is about the implementation of the graduate tax. These headlines do not come from today's press; they come from the press of 1989 when the previous Hawke-Keating Labor government introduced the HECS graduate charge, which members opposite are now so outraged by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important at the outset of these remarks to stress the important continuities in higher education policy and to remind the House of the things which everyone believes in. It is easy to think from listening to speeches opposite that we are riven by a fundamental gulf. I think that is very much exaggerating the position. One of the problems that the previous Prime Minister faced, despite the high marks of leadership of which he was capable, was a chronic inability to be inclusive, a chronic inability to see the other person's point of view and a chronic inability to lead everyone as opposed simply to leading a faction, a party or a class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three things that we all believe in. First of all, on both sides of this House there is a strong belief in trying to ensure that the little people of this country, the battlers of this country, get the fair go they so richly deserve. There are people on this side of the House who can quite easily quote to members opposite Ben Chifley's `light on the hill' <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4050"> speech. There are people on this side of the House who are just as inspired by that light on the hill as members opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that all of us are working for the betterment of mankind, not just here but wherever we can lend a helping hand. It ill becomes members opposite to impute bad motives and bad faith to this government. Obviously, members opposite are perfectly entitled to criticise our policy. By all means criticise our policy. Better policy is produced because of the dialectical process which we see in this parliament. But, please, let us not impute bad faith to people simply because of a divergence of view about policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both of us believe in our university system. Both of us believe that good universities are the hallmark of a civilised society. Both of us&mdash;this side and that side&mdash;believe in the system of HECS funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system of HECS funding was designed and developed in this country by the previous government&mdash;and let us give the previous government credit for the HECS system. The HECS system is a marvellous blend of the user&hyphen;pays principle and social equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The beauty of the HECS system is that no-one is required to pay for their university education until they are in a position to do so. We do not demand fees of people who are not in a position to afford it. We seek reimbursement from graduates when they are earning an income. This is the genius of the HECS system and this is something which is just as strongly supported on this side of the House as on that side of the House. I have to say, listening to a succession of speakers opposite paying tribute to Gough Whitlam for the abolition of fees in 1974&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that HECS is not a new policy. HECS is a policy introduced by the previous government. I was about to say that there is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a sense of hypocrisy about members opposite. That is too strong. I simply want to say that there is a sense of double standards about members opposite. It was the one&hyphen;time Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley)&mdash;as I was reminded today by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew)&mdash;who supported double HECS for postgraduate students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was Neville Wran at the time of the introduction of HECS who called for differential HECS for different courses. It was Neville Wran who supported the idea of a 15 per cent surcharge on HECS which could be applied at the discretion of the universities themselves. It is the member for Werriwa, none other than Mark Latham himself, who, in a very interesting and good speech, recently said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.. that the state should also encourage contributory schemes that would allow for more self&hyphen;financed welfare.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is an excellent point that he makes. What we are doing here with these HECS charges, with these user charges or fees, is trying to ensure that the beneficiaries pay a greater proportion of the cost of their education. Mr Latham said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . government should replace "rigid supply&hyphen;side assistance" with more flexible demand&hyphen;side solutions.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, an excellent idea. That is precisely what we are doing with our changes to higher education funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that what we are doing is fair, it is reasonable and it is right. When you ask yourself what benefit university graduates get from their education, it is an immense benefit. The average graduate earns $300,000 over the course of a working life more than the average non-graduate. Studies have shown&mdash;and there have been numerous studies quoted on both sides of the House today&mdash;that the abolition of fees in 1974 did not make our universities more egalitarian, and the introduction of HECS in 1989 by the previous government did not make them less egalitarian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4051"> The fact is that the HECS charges, even at the maximum rate of $5,500 a year for cours es like dentistry, medicine, vet and law, add up in the case of a medical graduate to less than the price of a Holden Commodore. Surely asking graduates to pay the price of a Holden Commodore for an asset that will stand them in good stead for the rest of their lives is not too much to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple truth is that the fee&hyphen;free regime brought in by Gough Whitlam meant that everyone in our society, rich and poor alike, were subsidising the future rich. So we are actually bringing in a more egalitarian measure and producing a more egalitarian society with these sorts of changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is always disappointing to see anyone in this House appealing to the concept of the class war. It does not help. The fact is we live in a society where social barriers, such as they are, are fluid and relatively easy to overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa talked about the Australian dream of access to university. It is part of the Australian dream and it is a part of the Australian dream which will never die. It is a part of the Australian dream which is far more durable than aspects of government policy which come and go. Indeed, it is part of the Australian dream which has been lived just as much in my own family as in the family of the member for Werriwa. My father and my mother were both the first members of their families to go to university. I have to say that they did so in the era of fees, just as working&hyphen;class children will continue to go to university in the era of HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to some points made earlier by the shadow minister, the member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin). The basic problem with the shadow minister's speech was that he must be suffering from the relevance deprivation syndrome, much the same as the shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), because he has been reduced to the pathetic level of scaring vulnerable people by dressing up in a Boris Karloff uniform, by dressing up in a sheet. The ghostly former higher education minister has been trying to tell people that the world as we know it has ended and their life, as they had thought it would develop, is over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes to higher education will mean more places for students, not fewer; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more graduates, not fewer; and better pay for university professors, not worse. In fact, $50 million more is being spent by the Commonwealth on higher education this year than last year. I accept what the shadow minister says, that there is a cut on the forward estimates. Of course I accept that. But you cannot cut what people have not got, and cuts to the forward estimates are not cuts in the same sense as are cuts to operating grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the worst, a cut to a forward estimate means a reduction in services one might have, a reduction in people who might have been there. But we&mdash;and I stress this&mdash;are producing a different university system. We are giving the universities the freedom, autonomy and flexibility to make up in the private sector what they are no longer getting from the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard from the shadow minister a lot of talk about breach of promise. I almost thought for a while we were going to hear the name Pauline mentioned.</PARA>

We promised to retain Austudy. Austudy is retained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4052"> We have tried to produce a better higher education system. We have tried to avoid this mindless cost&hyphen;cutting exercise, of which we are accused so frequently by members oppos ite, and instead produce a better higher education system. And I have to say I think we have succeeded. Not only do I think we have succeeded but people who know think we have succeeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Professor David Beanland, has said that our changes will enable the universities to move away from excessive dependence on government. Before the budget Professor Beanland said that a 30 per cent increase in HECS would enable the universities to avoid serious funding cuts. Professor Alan Gilbert said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the fact is that, unlike up&hyphen;front fees, a HECS liability does not discriminate against poorer students and families. Research into the impact of HECS indicates that low socio&hyphen;economic status groups or other disadvantaged sections of society have not been turned away from higher education by current levels of HECS. HECS is a deferred liability, payable only if and when the student enters the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important for members opposite to remember that. Indeed, there is an enormous amount of sour grapes from members opposite. The shadow minister quoted Professor Gavin Brown. It is fine to quote Professor Gavin Brown but Professor Gavin Brown is one of those vice&hyphen;chancellors calling upon the opposition to allow our package through in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite are perhaps just a little bit dismayed that their allies of a few months ago, the vice&hyphen;chancellors, have come out in full support today of the government's industrial relations package. The university academics are on the side of the government. Let me quote Professor Austin Gough talking about the failings of our university system under the previous government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The universities currently suffer from chronic overcrowding, crippling staff shortages, deteriorating equipment and low morale, especially amongst research&hyphen;oriented staff.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the most extraordinary aspect of this tantrum&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he may as well have been referring to the tantrums of members opposite&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the universities has been the assumption that if there are to be cuts, they must inevitably fall on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> academic side. Hardly anybody has suggested that universities could save a high proportion of their costs, far higher than the famous 12%, by dismantling some parts of their vast administrations.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to talk about the sorts of burdens that the universities currently face because of the system introduced by the previous government. Continuing:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to "justify" funding means that every level of a university has to keep up with a constantly revolving treadmill of submissions, collated with the necessary statistics by teams of administrators and forwarded to Canberra, where, cynics insist, they are taken straight to the shredder.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whole floors of buildings are filled with working parties drawing up quality assurance profiles and strategic planning projections, all of them, in the way of university business, rendered immediately obsolete by the continual flux and change of policy decision.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time the academic side continues to shrink. A modern university is like an army division which keeps sacking its front&hyphen;line fighting troops and appointing more systems analysts, quality control consultants and affirmative action monitors. Eventually, like Jim Hacker's hospital without patients, it will reach its ideal state.</PARA>
<PARA>The fundamental difference&mdash;and this is an important difference&mdash;between the government and the opposition is that the opposition believes in an essentially bureaucratic approach to higher education while the government believes in an essentially student and academic based approach to higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister talked about quality assurance programs under the previous government. I do not deny that these were good programs, but more responsiveness to students is far more likely to produce the high quality universities that the shadow minister wants than reliance on departmental measures generated from Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this government does have a different philosophy of education funding. We believe that a university should be given the freedom, the flexibility and the autonomy that befits great institutions&mdash;institutions which have a life of their own far beyond the policy of any government, institutions which will long outlive any government and institutions which shape and turn society in ways <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4053"> much more fundamental than that of any government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that our higher education system should be driven more by students and less by bureaucracy. We think it should be focused more on excellence and less on social engineering. We think our universities should be allowed to pursue learning for learning's sake as they see these things rather than having to respond to every passing whim of the federal government. We believe that higher education institutions should not be pensioners of the federal government but great autonomous institutions beholden to their own students and their own values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I say that the opposition does face a very important challenge. It is all very well for the opposition to stand up like Chicken Little and claim again and again that the sky is falling in, to claim again and again that the world as we know it has come to an end. Yes, the world as they knew it has come to an end, because they are on the other side of the House, but they will get used to it. They will have a long time to get used to it. The fact is that our universities have a future, and a future that must be secured, and a future that will be secured by the policies of this government. Let me conclude by quoting Professor Gilbert, the vice-chancellor of Melbourne university, who says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Simple opposition to the Budget's revenue&hyphen;side measures will leave Australian universities with few alternatives to the melancholy tyranny of cuts and loss of quality.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When my speech on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) was interrupted last night, I was commenting on the severe cuts to overseas aid contained in this budget. The aid program has been cut by 10 per cent in real terms, taking us well below the OECD average and making hollow the government's stated commitment of reaching 0.7 per cent of GNP ratio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4055">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a world in which the richest 20 per cent of people have 85 per cent and the poorest 20 per cent have only 1.4 per cent of the world's income&mdash;as ACFOA commented in its budget analysis&mdash;cuts to aid are simply immoral. Twenty years ago Australia and Denmark gave the same level of aid and now Denmark gives almost one per cent of GNP whilst Australia gives only 0.29 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ACFOA has said that we have become the mean country. But I am most concerned, as I indicated last night, about cuts to population programs. I am especially concerned that, for cheap political reasons, the government has bowed to pressure from Senator Harradine. I know that there are many members of the government who feel strongly about the aid question, especially about the population program. I ask these members to use their influence on the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). Given his past record and his past work in this field, I know he himself is sympathetic to it. It is important to send a message to the Australian people that every member in this chamber does not take the same view on foreign aid as does the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, only three weeks ago in the parliament, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade held a most important seminar dealing with the question of aid&mdash;and I understand that the report of that seminar will be brought down next week. That was a bipartisan group who had a deep commitment and deep concern about the aid question. I know that there are very few votes in the overseas aid question and very few votes in the population question, but sometimes governments have to make decisions that are not solely dependent on how many votes they are going to get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of population, every year some 600,000 women die because of complications in childbirth and pregnancy; another 75,000 women die because of backyard or self-attempted abortion.

So too should they stick in the mind of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who, as I said earlier, should, and indeed does, know better.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite what many may think, Australia is a wealthy country&mdash;but what message are we sending to the world and, more importantly, what message are we sending to our near neighbours? It gives the impression that Australia is a mean and selfish nation, unwilling to make a fair contribution to the challenges of eradicating poverty. Often what we give in aid, we are more than adequately compensated for. It is an investment in the future of our own region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made much of the impact of targeting the wealthy in its budget measures. Is there an impact? If anything, instead of an impact, it is a mere tickle. The tax office provided advice to the former government that $800 million in revenue could be raised by targeting just 100 Australians. The government has managed to raise just $100 million. As I said, it is a tickle&mdash;more to make the wealthy laugh than anything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget is a massive betrayal by the Prime Minister. The real effects are beginning to come to light as it comes under intense scrutiny. It is not the budget which Australia `had to have'. Its savagery is unnecessary. For all the pain, the unemployment rate will still remain over eight per cent for the rest of this decade. This is small-minded, narrow ideology in the vein of Thatcherism. Mainstream Australia, to use that dreaded word, will reject this budget when they discover, as they will, that they are in fact `the rich who will pay'. The opposition will ensure that the people of Australia do not forget this fact at the next election.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some members of the House may have seen TV footage of some young Australian students studying at Oxford in the late 1960s. Asked how they felt about returning to Australia, one of them, sitting on those lawns, replied that he felt something like St Augustine: let me return to Australia, but not just now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps someone knows who that student was. Thirty years later that student has not changed; he still wants it both ways. That student, who already back in the late 1960s was sporting a very mean set of whiskers, is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4056"> now the shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt, Gareth Evans QC, and he is still singing an Augustinian tune: give me fiscal rectitude, but not just now; give me chastity and continence, but not just now; we want a budget in surplus, but not just now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Budget paper No. 1 reveals historical data for budget deficits over the last 35 years&mdash;and I suggest that members opposite have a look at it. Do you know who had the record for budget deficits? It was the failed Keating government. What do you see? In 1991-92 they brought down an $11.4 billion deficit; 1992-93, a $17 billion deficit; 1993-94&mdash;and that was their best one&mdash;a $17.1 billion deficit; 1994-95, a $13.2 billion deficit; and 1995-96, a $10.3 billion deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those budget papers, the historical record, show a litany of debt and deficit. To put it into perspective, no other Australian government has ever recorded a budget deficit of over $10 billion. Labor brought down five in a row. As Prime Minister, Paul Keating never delivered a budget deficit below $10 billion&mdash;never. The failed Keating government accumulated $69 billion in budget deficits over the last five years. Lee Majors may have been the Six Million Dollar Man, but Labor had their Sixty Nine Billion Dollar Man&mdash;Paul Keating. And who was holding the purse strings; who was the Minister for Finance at the end of the failure of the Keating government? It was the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So with Keating following the deficit road of Cain, Bannon and Burke, this government had no choice but to embark on a program of fiscal consolidation. Rather than last year's smoke and mirrors budget, or Ralph Willis's fudge-it budget, this year the focus has been on the underlying budget deficit to show the true level of fiscal consolidation. The headline budget deficit, the old government's favourite tool, gave little indication of the fiscal stance. Labor hid behind this figure, fudging it with their assets sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the budget deficit was $10.3 billion, or 2.1 per cent of GDP. This year it will be an estimated $5.6 billion, or 1.1 per cent of GDP. That represents an improvement of one per cent of GDP in the underlying budget deficit. If this government had taken <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no action, the budget deficit would have been $9.5 billion. This government has achieved a $4 billion improvement in the budget. That has been due to a $3 billion reduction in outlays and a $1 billion increase in revenue. It is very different to the sorts of measures that the previous government tried where they relied very heavily on increased taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 30 years, Australia has faced two brakes to economic growth: the current account and inflation. Australia has been unable to grow much above the three per cent per annum speed limit, without running into a current account blow&hyphen;out or an inflationary crunch. It is only by having an underlying budget balance over the economic cycle that we, as a nation, can improve our national saving levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's underlying budget balance ran an average surplus of two per cent of GDP until 1974; and since 1974 it has averaged a deficit of 1.4 per cent of GDP. In a sense, Australia has never recovered from the explosion in outlays that we witnessed during the Whitlam government. It will take three years before the Commonwealth government will again make a contribution to lifting national saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, Labor offered and still proffer deficit and debt into the next century, asking future generations to pay for their profligacy. Over the medium term, by reducing these structural current account constraints on growth, we will be able to grow at a higher rate than three per cent to allow a meaningful reduction in unemployment. There is no other way to do it. Labour market programs will not do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some have said that in the late 1980s Labor used a similar strategy of fiscal consolidation to generate a budget surplus. That did not achieve the goal of reducing the current account deficit. The problem was that, while it generated an increase in public saving and national saving, the current account deficit did not fall due to the strong rate of private investment coupled with a fall in private sector saving and rising exchange rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To significantly reduce unemployment we need to address the whole issue of national saving. The rise in public and national saving <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4057"> that will come from this budget will decrease long&hyphen;term interest rates. Monetary policy may also be eased, leading to a boost in business and residential investment by decreasing short&hyphen;term interest rates. Significantly, these decreases in interest rates will exert downward pressure on the exchange rates to encourage exports and decrease imports, with strong world economic growth and domestically low inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one would seriously argue that the current account deficit is not a problem at around four per cent of GDP. That is one of the highest levels in the OECD. Unless we save more and continue to invest we cannot reduce the current account deficit over time. Without addressing that issue, we become more dependent on foreign credit and more vulnerable to international shocks. It might appear as though we can but we cannot borrow forever. At some stage, someone has to settle the debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main instrument available to government to increase national saving relative to national investment and to address the high level of the current account deficit is to get the budget back into balance. It has been the decline in public saving since 1974 that has directly led to the structural blowout in the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As FitzGerald noted in his report to the Treasurer in 1993, it is that decline in government saving, especially at the Commonwealth level, which has been the major contributor to the decline in national saving over the last 20 years. As well, due to the strong disincentives for Australian households to save, Australia is one of only two OECD countries in which household saving fell as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So while International Monetary Fund and OECD reports indicate that there are some changes that occur in private sector saving which compensate for improvements in public sector saving, the OECD has also found that improvements in public sector saving usually lead to increased national saving. In other words, the increase in public saving almost always outweighs the decline you can sometimes see in private sector saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, International Monetary Fund analysis indicates that fiscal improvement is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more successful if outlays are targeted rather than revenue increased due to the high dead weight cost of marginal taxation. Significantly, Labor's attempts, for example in 1993, to improve the budget deficit relied on raising taxes while expanding programs. That is just the international recipe for failure. It is the wrong course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They wanted to increase things like the wholesale sales tax on cars, wine and building materials, not realising that it is better to reduce the outlays rather than raise taxes. This government, which has seen a $4 million improvement in the budget this year, has achieved most of that by reducing outlays, by reducing programs, rather than through any increase in taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Commonwealth government net debt has exploded from four per cent of GDP in 1989&hyphen;90 to 19 per cent of GDP in 1995&hyphen;96. The explosion is actually worse than those figures indicate because the sale of assets, like the Commonwealth Bank, that we saw in that period belie the true explosion of the debt under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those figures are disgraceful and highlight the crushing burden that Labor has passed on to the next generation. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said on budget night, we did not create the problem but we will take responsibility for it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle of this budget, therefore, revolves around the issue of intergenerational equity. It goes deeper by grounding itself in issues of fairness and justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some strange reason, as they ticked away into the last decade of this century, the Labor government stalled, and they stayed stalled for six years. Former ministers, like Peter Walsh, have commented on this. But recently it was a former Treasurer, John Dawkins, who addressed this issue at a function for the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia. He observed that his 1993 budget was the only attempt Labor made at fiscal consolidation after 1988, and that, apart from this, Labor had dropped their bundle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Max Walsh has confirmed this by declaring this year's budget the most responsible and the best budget since 1987. Interestingly, it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4058"> has also been the most popular one since 1987. Newspoll shows that it has been the most well&hyphen;received budget since that year. It is both economically responsible and popular&mdash;a strange mix. A clear majority supports the hard decision to deliver a better future. Members opposite, like the member for Banks (Mr Melham), are still in shock or denial, I am not sure which; eventually they will come to acceptance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise that fiscal tightening is consistent with strong economic growth. Some of the ALP are still so blinded by pump priming and government intervention that they cannot conceive that the economy has a second, more efficient engine of growth&mdash;the private sector. They think that jobs are something you buy rather than create.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International Monetary Fund and OECD recent outlooks report that fiscal contraction is quite consistent with short&hyphen;term economic growth. Over the last decade, Australia's private sector saving has consistently fallen below private sector investment. In the United States and other industrial countries we have seen the opposite. Their private sectors, by and large, have been net savers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The international comparisons that we have heard in this debate from the shadow Treasurer and from the former Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), are fairly meaningless because they ignore the private saving levels of comparable countries. They ignore the private saving levels of other industrialised countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a savings gap in our private sector. The most important thing for the government to do is increase public saving and then encourage long&hyphen;term private sector saving by removing some of the disincentives to saving, such as middle class welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another structural obstacle to high economic growth is the rigidities in the labour market which contribute to structural unemployment. This budget, as well as the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, addresses some of those speed limits to growth in the Australian economy. Three weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition, in his budget reply&mdash;if people did not catch it, they did not miss much&mdash;said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead of undermining growth, the Government should be promoting it. And with more growth the budget could be restored to balance without the need for savage cuts to valuable public programs.</PARA>
<PARA>So what we have here is another disciple of St Augustine, another one who wants it both ways. Let us think about what he is saying. He is saying that we have a budget in deficit but we need to spend more to grow and then that growth will miraculously eliminate the need to address the structural budget deficit. Well, we have now had five years of growth. Surely the budget under that strategy would be in surplus by now. How many more years of growth do we need before we see this strategy work? John Hyde said last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Government (had continued) to budget as if there were no tomorrow, capital (would) migrate to places where the tomorrows look brighter. In the longer run, so (too would) our brightest young people.</PARA>
<PARA>In periods of economic growth you strengthen the fiscal position. As a disciple of John Dawkins and Paul Keating, the Leader of the Opposition really believes that with growth the budget will repair itself. He believes that the budget will whirr back towards balance&mdash;no trouble at all. That is wrong. Keating and Dawkins were saying that 3&half; years ago, and without action this year we would have had a $9.6 billion deficit&mdash;three years down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP agree that Australia has long had a savings problem. They agree that we need to restore the budget to balance, but by opposing the reductions in outlays they do nothing to help. When in office they never took the hard decisions to benefit this country's future. This government will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the shadow Treasurer and the former Treasurer have told the House that our debt is not high by OECD standards. What they neglected to mention is the trend in growth that we have seen in Commonwealth net debt, from four per cent to 19 per cent of GDP, over six years. It is really that trend rather than the overall level of debt which is worrying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also said that our budget deficit is low by OECD standards. That may be true, but in contrast with other industrialised countries we have a low and declining level of private <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4059"> savings. So we cannot really make that sort of comparison. Our national savings is average but our investment needs are relatively high and therefore so is our current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comparisons are odious and the Evans and Willis international comparisons are misleading. We do have a national savings problem. They know it. In seeking to drape themselves in an apology and international comparisons, they are making excuses for their own inability to deal with the structural budget deficit in the past and for their opposition to our budget. Labor just cannot have it both ways. There are no St Augustines here. By blocking portions of this budget, Labor will end the 1990s in the manner that they entered them: irresponsibly. Old Jelly Back may not be here but they are still going down the same track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Asked if the blocking of spending cuts in the Senate might see an interest rate rise similar to the one after the 1993 budget impasse, Bernie Fraser said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Budget encounters difficulties in the Senate, and if in the other circumstances of the time this causes the financial markets to take flight, if that in turn causes the exchange rate to plummet as happened on the earlier occasion (1993) and for that in turn to have implications&mdash;adverse implications&mdash;for inflation, it's in that context that monetary policy comes in and becomes relevant and it was in that context that it was raised earlier on.</PARA>
<PARA>Only Bernie Fraser could say that. What he is actually saying is that, if interest rates rise, then people with credit cards, people with mortgages and people with small businesses can blame Labor's obstruction in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to commend the government for the introduction of the charter of budget honesty. By encouraging sound fiscal management and transparent fiscal reporting, we will encourage future governments to be responsible, not reckless; to be principled, not pragmatic. In addition, the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report, which will be prepared by the secretaries to the Department of the Treasury and Finance, will give updated information during the election campaign. In the future no new government will be hit with an $8 billion surprise hole on their first day. No incoming government in the future <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will ever have to come in and find $8 billion missing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also applaud the introduction of a trial of accrual accounting and look forward to future budgets being based on an accrual basis. Without full accrual accounting, without taking account of depreciation, the budget balance is actually overstated so that a budget surplus is required to represent balance on a full accrual basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I began my speech by recalling the shadow Treasurer on the lawns of Oxford. In closing, I would like to recall the shadow Treasurer as an Australian at Oxford, as a student in London, in the swinging sixties. Back then he did not experience what he would later describe in midlife as `severe relevance deprivation'. Indeed, dancing the night away in an Oxford pub or in Hyde Park to the beat of the Rolling Stones&mdash;I am only surmising this, but his free&hyphen;flowing style when dancing with Ros Kelly at that True Believers dinner in 1993 must have been finely honed somewhere&mdash;the shadow minister, influenced by Mick Jagger, may have sung and may have believed that `Time is on our side'. But, sadly, the good times come to an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">St Augustine of Hippo recognised the need for conversion. It is time St Augustine of Holt did the same. This budget is about intergenerational equity. It is about guaranteeing a secure future for our children. The best educated generation is still waiting on the most fortunate generation, and future generations are waiting for this parliament to secure the foundation for a fair and just future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to add to an answer I gave in question time this afternoon. The answer needs both clarification and qualification. The particular point I made was that there are provisions in the Director of Public Prosecutions Act for the Attorney-General or the Minister for Justice to give tightly defined directions to the DPP. I added that my understanding is that not only have I not but no predecessor of mine has given directions under that act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the act, a direction once given by instrument in writing must be tabled in the parliament and published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. The minister may give both a general policy direction and a direction to prosecute or not prosecute in a particular case. What I said was correct in the sense that no direction has been given to prosecute or not prosecute in a particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there have been three directions to the DPP of other types, as I am advised. At the DPP's request in about 1987, when I suspect the Hon. Lionel Bowen was the Attorney-General, a direction was given to require the production of a document to the committee constituted by the parliament and chaired by the Hon. Harry Gibbs to inquire into the conduct of the late Justice Murphy. Then in September 1992 Attorney-General Duffy gave a direction to require increased cooperative arrangements between the DPP and the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most recently the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), as the then Minister for Justice, gave a direction in October 1994 in general terms to require the DPP not to prosecute under the child sex tourism provisions of the Crimes Act where the prosecution was dependent upon a residency connection with Australia and the residence in question was temporary only and not to prosecute persons under 18 without the consent of the Attorney-General. I am pleased to have had that opportunity to both clarify and qualify my answer. I am indebted to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to draw to the House's attention a decision by the federal government to drop a compensation package for noise affected areas surrounding Perth airport and to institute into the airport noise compensation area one rule for Sydney and other rules for other areas. In September 1995 the previous government made a decision to extend the noise compensation package from Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport to Perth airport and other major city airports&mdash;in particular Brisbane, where the decision was announced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The start of the process for Perth airport was the commencement of a noise audit or a scoping study. When the writs were issued for the now not so recent federal election, a contract for the commencement of the noise audit or scoping study was on then federal transport minister Laurie Brereton's desk and could not be signed as a result of the calling of the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the return of the election writs until some time in June my office harassed on a regular basis the office of the now Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), seeking advice as to when the scoping study would commence. Last month I was advised by the minister's office, and it has been confirmed in an answer which I listed in this House, that the proposed scoping study would not proceed and the compensation package would not be extended to Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That creates a legislative regime which is good enough for the residents of Sydney, if they happen to live next to the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), but one which is not good enough for the residents of Perth.

In the course of his contribution to this debate the member for Swan said that to have a compensation regime for Perth airport was pork&hyphen;barrelling. That was the first point. The second point was that to have a noise compensation regime for Perth was not appropriate and that one should simply compulsorily acquire the homes of people who live in Queens Road in South Guildford.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of the public conversations we have been having, the member for Swan also asserted incorrectly that there was no need to undertake an audit study or scoping study because this was ongoing at Perth airport. If you look, you will see in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> an answer from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development making it patently clear that no audit study will commence.

Australia on the other hand has had an uninterrupted period of peaceful and democratic government where the wishes of the people, both at a state and Commonwealth level, determine who is in government. Very few Western nations have had such longstanding democratic traditions. Even nations like Germany, Italy and Japan have had periods of undemocratic practices. Even dramatic changes in the Australian political system have come about through the ballot box.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, today we have a situation where the ALP has not been happy to accept the outcome of the election of 2 March. The ALP's court challenge to the election of Jackie Kelly in the New South Wales seat of Lindsay reflects the Labor Party's state of denial. The result of that election in Lindsay on 2 March was that Miss Kelly polled 38,442 votes while the Labor candidate, former Keating government minister, Ross Free, polled 36,088 votes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite right&mdash;a failed minister. The people of Lindsay have had Labor members for 51 out of the last 56 years. That shows the magnitude of the defeat. Prior to the last election the seat was held by the ALP with a margin of 10.3 per cent. The swing to the coalition on 2 March was over 11 per cent, handing the seat to Jackie Kelly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party's court challenge to the election result in Lindsay on technical constitutional grounds reflects an inability to accept this stunning rejection in that ALP stronghold. The most remarkable aspect of the ALP's challenge is that they tried to have Ross Free declared re&hyphen;elected without a by-election. That is on the public record. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> reported on 30 July:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former incumbent and former Labor Minister, Mr Ross Free who held the seat for 12 years, argues that the court should declare him the winner by a special count.</PARA>
<PARA>This would be a gross distortion of the intentions of the electors of Lindsay on 2 March. Apparently ALP members believe the people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Lindsay, who overwhelmingly rejected Mr Free and the Labor Party, should have their wishes overturned even without a fresh by-election. Mr Free was seeking to avoid a by-election and simply have himself appointed as the member for Lindsay. As Laurie Oakes said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>  recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the court to simply give the seat to Free now would mean installing someone the voters rejected in one of the biggest swings in the March poll. To deprive the people of Lindsay of the right to choose who should represent them would be quite unjust. If the boot was on the other foot, Beazley would be arguing loudly in favour of a democratic vote, of letting the people decide.</PARA>
<PARA>As a result of today's High Court decision, the people will decide. We look forward to seeing Jackie Kelly back in the parliament in a few weeks times. Then the people of Corangamite and Corio can see a truly democratic action in the parliament and at the polling booths.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to bring a matter before this House which is of critical importance to the economic future of the Geelong region and to the state of Victoria. It concerns the future of ASTAAS and the 450 people currently employed in the company, and the future development of Avalon airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend to go into the recent history of Aerospace Technologies of Australia and its passenger aircraft refurbishment arm, ASTA Aircraft Services, in the House tonight. However, in 1995 the then Labor government committed some $6 million to keep the doors of ASTAAS open and to secure the employment of the 450 workers at the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government of the day sought bids from the private sector to purchase ASTAAS and Avalon airport and it is those bids that are now being considered by the current government. I am informed that the government is close to making a decision on the sale of ASTAAS and my appeal tonight goes to the government to ensure the ongoing viability of the company and secure the jobs of the 450 workers at the facility.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4063">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASTAAS work force is a highly skilled work force which has been a cooperative pacesetter in enterprise bargaining and in changing the culture of workplaces throughout this country. The company, like others in this industry, has experienced some difficulty in recent times in securing ongoing work. But it has survived to this point and last year it made a modest profit. An analysis of its market potential indicates a lift in global refurbishment activity in 1997. The company is well poised to take advantage of that upturn. Therefore, it is important that the government's decision actively supports the company and its future potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of ASTAAS to the Geelong economy cannot be understated. It has been estimated that it pours some $16 million into the Geelong economy annually. Its closure would not only represent a serious blow to the local regional economy but also represent a blow to the Victorian state economy. I understand the Victorian state government has made representations to the federal government to assist ASTAAS in keeping its doors open and to reach a position of viability over the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposals have been put to the government to develop Avalon airport as a dedicated airfreight hub, specialising in the export of perishable foods from the region to Asia in particular. This proposal has had the general support of the City of Greater Geelong, the Geelong regional trades and labour council and the business organisations in the Geelong community. It also has broad support within the Geelong community as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The development of the airport in this way ought to be viewed by the government as an opportunity to strengthen ASTAAS and to diversify its activities. As I understand it, there are no facilities for the refurbishment and maintenance of freighter jumbo aircraft in the Southern Hemisphere. Such a development would offer additional opportunities to ASTAAS to secure ongoing work and the employment of the workers at the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a unique opportunity to maintain and promote employment in the Geelong region. I believe that tomorrow a delegation from the city of Greater Geelong&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employers, unions and their representatives at ASTAAS&mdash;will be meeting with the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey). I am very pleased that the finance minister has agreed to meet the delegation at such short notice. I ask him to listen very carefully to the arguments that will be presented to him tomorrow because there is a unique opportunity at ASTAAS and at Avalon airport for the government to have a win, for the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) and I to have a win, for the Geelong community to have win and for the workers at ASTAAS particularly to have a win. I ask the finance minister to consider those arguments carefully, to look sympathetically upon them and to secure the jobs of the 450 workers who rely on this facility for their employment.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.46 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of my colleague in the class of 96, the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), a person of high regard and integrity who has worked extremely hard both in the parliament and in the electorate of Lindsay since her election on 2 March. Today, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the High Court has ruled on a constitutional technicality that the election of the member for Lindsay is invalid, forcing the electors of this electorate back to the polls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision, which has been pursued by an opposition which was rejected wholeheartedly at the last election, has been accepted and the ramifications are simple. Once again, the people of Lindsay have to make a choice in a by&hyphen;election, a choice which they already made in March this year, the choice to give Jackie Kelly and the Howard government a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The election result in the seat of Lindsay typified the moves against the opposition not only in the seat of Lindsay but also in my seat of Petrie where there was a swing of over 12 per cent. In Lindsay, the member achieved an 11.5 per cent swing. Labor needs only a 1.5 per cent swing to win that seat. The average swing against any government in a by-election is 4.3 per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4064">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The swing against the opposition highlighted the fact that the people had had enough. The Penrith area, which is represented by the member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey), had been held by Labor for 51 out of 56 years. With high interest rates, high unemployment and high foreign debt, the former government left this country with a bankcard bill which any excess shopper would be proud of. The government will not shirk its responsibility and is working towards repaying this huge debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first Costello budget was fair and reasonable in bringing benefits to families, small business and our young people. The family tax initiatives will place money back into the hands and pockets of the people of Lindsay. This government has already worked and will continue to work for small business&mdash;providing real jobs, giving confidence and enabling a return to consumer spending. A key area of this government's election platform was giving hope to our young people. The schools will again have extra resources and we will be able to prepare people, especially young people, for future employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Lindsay have already spoken in very large numbers. Theirs was a vote for change but, more clearly, it was a vote for a hard worker, a vote for someone who knows the people she represents&mdash;their needs and their wants. During the member for Lindsay's first speech she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lindsay is full of ordinary battlers: PAYE taxpayers, paying off a mortgage, who are concerned about interest rates; people who are concerned about providing for their old age; people who want to give their children more than they had themselves; people who are working so hard and still not getting ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend the member for Lindsay for her fortitude. She has taken the decision by the High Court with dignity and compassion&mdash;and she is a fighter. I note her experience in the Australian armed forces as a squadron leader, a role which in the past provided her with grit and determination to stand in what was considered a very safe Labor seat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, she has the will to work hard to achieve the goals she has set. People do not like elections; the cost of elections is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> crippling. The people of Australia are paying for Labor's mismanagement, yet here we have a situation where the member for Lindsay won her seat in this parliament with the support of a majority of the electorate and, through a technicality, will be forced back to the polls at a massive cost to the Australian people&mdash;and not just in money terms, as this outcome will leave many constituents in the electorate terribly confused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lindsay was proud to take up a career as a people's representative. She said in her maiden speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no going back. I will fight for their interests because in the end I must return to live amongst them, and I will do so with my head held high.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Lindsay is a fighter. She deserves to hold her head high and I look forward to her having a very long and rewarding career in this House.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.51 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I wish to raise tonight is of some pertinence to the Lindsay by&hyphen;election because it relates to the people of western Sydney. That matter is the extraordinary decision on the part of the government to impose a prospective airport at Holsworthy. It is a decision of absolute deceit; a decision of complete betrayal of the battlers of western Sydney and the area around the prospective Holsworthy airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to bring to the attention of the House a specific example of a person who has purchased land in the immediate vicinity of the proposed Holsworthy airport without knowing what was planned and being almost deliberately misled. I will read part of the letter from Mark Northridge, who has recently purchased this land. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the beginning of this year we started looking for land within the Bankstown/Liverpool area and were advised to look at Wattle Grove near Holsworthy. We approached Defin Realty (NSW) Pty Limited on behalf of the Defence Housing Authority to discuss the land for sale at Wattle Grove.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were assured that no airport was being reconsidered, as Holsworthy had been rejected in 1985, and that the current urban growth within the Bankstown/Liverpool region was being encouraged by all government authorities. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4065"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore we placed a holding deposit on a block of land on the 14th of March 1996, and during this period from 14th of March to 3rd May 1996 we made further enquiries with other government bodies to confirm that no activity was being considered for a second airport near Wattle Grove.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After receiving confirmation that no Airport was being considered we went ahead and paid the full 10% deposit and exchanged contracts to purchase the block of land we picked on the 3rd of May 1996. Then the announcement on the 20th of May by Mr John Sharp Minister of Transport that Holsworthy would be reconsidered as a possible airport site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have also recently sold our current home at 41 Clarke Street Bass Hill and have moved out on the 26th of May 1996 to move into my mother in law's home while our new home is being built. We have settled on our land with the Defence Housing Authority on the 28th of June 1996. It is now too late for us to pull out of the purchase of the land, as we will be in breach of the contract. Our plans to build our home are currently with Liverpool Council and we expect them back shortly.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a classic example of complete betrayal by this government. These people made decisions after the election with respect to information that had been provided by a government authority, the Defence Housing Authority. They acted in good faith on that information and they have been completely misled and completely let down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to quote a letter that was sent to Mr Northridge by Mr Aldo Borgu, who is an adviser to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop). His only defence to effectively misleading somebody buying their house that no airport was under consideration for Holsworthy is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Housing Authority is in a commercial joint venture with a private sector firm to develop Wattle Grove and it would have been inappropriate for the Authority to have been given prior knowledge about the feasibility study, and thereby possibly placed in a superior position to other business interests in the Holsworthy area which might be affected by the announcement of the airport study.</PARA>
<PARA>That, in effect, is code for: `We did not want the Defence Housing Authority to lose any money because it would have ended up having to sell the land for lower prices because of the impact of the airport possibility on real estate, so we said, "No worries, you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can continue to sell the land to poor innocents like Mr Northridge while we as government know that we are thinking about putting an airport there and our own authorities are telling people buying that land that that is not happening".'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an absolute disgrace. That is absolute duplicity on the part of this government. It is a complete betrayal of the interests of the so&hyphen;called battlers that they purport to represent, the people that they say elected them. It is a classic example of the betrayal of the people of western Sydney, and it is the sort of behaviour which will ensure they lose the Lindsay by&hyphen;election and that people return Ross Free as the member for Lindsay in this parliament.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On reflection, she is a person who genuinely wants to represent her electorate, not sit back and take for granted the votes of local people as did the former member. There can be no other explanation as to why Labor suffered a very humiliating backlash in Lindsay. It is quickly worth reflecting on just where the Labor Party stands in this current climate. To use a sporting analogy, these are the people who will never accept an umpire's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4066"> decision. `Whatever it takes' is the old Labor war cry, and it takes the Supreme Court to give the local member yet another free kick and again to breathe life into a political corpse. It is another case of tall poppy syndrome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the football finals now upon us, it is a bit like this: they cannot accept the umpire's decision. It is like going to the footy on the weekend and watching your team get beaten, then going home and getting out the video and playing it frame by frame, praying that there was a forward pass.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line, through no fault of her own, through a constitutional anomaly, was that the pass was a little doubtful. We have had to put up with this constant whingeing and crying from a bloke who is about to be recycled from the grave. We have a member who, unfortunately, after today is no longer the member, and now has to go and fight hard. She has to fight the very way that people from the western suburbs know how to. She has to fight the way that people who know how to fight marginal seat campaigns fight, because that is what Jackie Kelly is full of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about underdogs, there are the dogs on that side and the underdog Jackie Kelly in the seat of Lindsay. This will not be an easy battle. This is not going to be a walk in. There is no more Paul Keating factor, but I can tell you now that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and a few of his mates are getting very close to that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been made clear, the opposition is in agreement with the provisions of the Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Amendment Bill 1996 and is happy to roll with it, so my contribution this morning is more broadly based in relation to the ACT and the people who work here. I have to observe&mdash;and this is one of my first opportunities to do so since a number of announcements have been made by the government about the fate of people working in the Capital Territory&mdash;that it is interesting that the domestic economy here is in a state of trauma over housing prices and the whole box and dice, as people are hunting around for packages and looking for some way to move out of Canberra because of the frenzy these people have about public servants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strange thing about it is that you would have thought that, from their time in opposition, the government would have at least understood who actually worked and lived in the ACT and who were public servants. What is very evident is that they have arrived in town in their new Rolls and they have decided, true to their commitment&mdash;one of the few promises they are keeping&mdash;to slash the federal Public Service. And have they done so! The only thing that they were too silly to understand was that 75 per cent of people who work in the federal Public Service do not live or work in Canberra but in fact deliver their services out in the regions and in places such as Bendigo, Ballarat, Bathurst, Cairns, Rockhampton, Townsville, Port Augusta and elsewhere. Of course, the transitional provisions for employment that are covered in this bill make a hell of a lot of sense&mdash;as long as you can sell your house in Canberra and as long as you can find a job somewhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in Bendigo last week when we observed what I would have called a routine public meeting, which had an astounding turnout. Part of it was generated by the `Bruce Reid black hole', as it is now being called in downtown Bendigo: the black hole of jobs and the black hole of Public Service morale and unfunded promises. Built into the budget provisions&mdash;not in relation to this particular bill&mdash;there are not only evil and downright unfair decisions, such as the dental scheme one, but also others, such as one I came across the other day that I thought harboured the most absurd decision I have heard or seen any federal government making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether the Australian Capital Territory (Consequential Provisions) Amendment Bill has any coverage of the CDEP&mdash;the community development employment program&mdash;for Aboriginal people, but I had to laugh at the inanity of the decision about a program where one group in the Australian community actually came to the federal government and said, `We want to work for the dole. Our people do not want sit&hyphen;down money. They want to work for the dole. Can we have a work for the dole scheme called the CDEP?' <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4069"> It was put in place, but guess what the government have done in the budget: they have scrapped the CDEP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have they done instead? They have increased unemployment benefits by $57 million for Aboriginal people so that they can have the dole but not work for it, against their wishes. When they get out there amongst redneck Australians, whom they continually placate with this frenzy about public servants and about Aboriginals, and start trying to explain to them why they have done very stupid things&mdash;such as slashing the federal Public Service, not realising that the people affected do not actually work in Canberra, and slashing the employment programs for Aboriginal people so that they can have the dole for sitting down rather than working&mdash;presumably someone within their ranks will start to ask some questions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill, the Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Amendment Bill 1996, deserves the support of the opposition and I thank the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) for confirming that, in fact, the opposition will be supporting the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, the ACT Government Service Act was established and, essentially, this allowed for mobility between ACT government employees and the more general Australian Public Service. It has become apparent in recent times, as the ACT corporatises part of its bureaucracy to make it more efficient and to make it operate better for the people of the Australian Capital Territory, that some of the provisions that employees of the bureaucracy thought would apply in fact did not. So this act allows the making of regulations which will allow people to hang on to their prior public service and to use that, if they decided to leave the branch or the corporatised body they were in, to compete on an equal basis with other people seeking jobs that become available in the broader Australian Public Service, wherever that might be. The government presents this bill as a mechanism to allow those good and long&hyphen;serving people with the Australian government bureaucracy to have job portability, and I think that is certainly a supportable measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was somewhat disappointed at the comments of the honourable member for Burke. He carried on somewhat about the loss of some public sector jobs. Let me say this to the Australian people: we were elected, I think, in large part, to try to do something about establishing a better base for the Australian economy and a better standard of living for all Australians. Last night, in a contribution to the budget debate, I made the point&mdash;and I would like to make it again&mdash;that I certainly believe that individuals have a better idea about how they would like to spend the money that they earn than does government. If we continue to tax the Australian people at a high rate and if we continue to decide how their money should be spent, then we deny them the opportunity to make decisions for themselves. I am well <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4070"> reminded that the corporate estate of the former Soviet Union did a very poor job of deciding how people's income should be spent. So much so, that that whole empire failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact that democratic governments around the world have proved successful because, to the largest extent, they allow their citizens freedom&mdash;freedom of choice and freedom of decision making. In this respect, if we are spending too much of the people's money on governing the people and providing services for the people which they might well provide for themselves, it is only fair and reasonable that we return to the people that decision making power. That, in essence, is what this is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Burke said that some of the government's programs were evil. What nonsense! He carried on apace about the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). I will stand up for the member for Bendigo, a colleague of mine, whom I know to have done a fantastic job in that region of the state of Victoria. He has been returned on two occasions, having originally won his seat in 1990, and the people of Bendigo support their honourable member. He fights hard for them. He works hard in this place to support the regional initiatives that are important for the people in Bendigo and the surrounding regions and his constituents know that. They know that and they know him well, and I am sure that they will disregard the less than honourable comments of the member for Burke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say something general about the ACT and the government in the ACT. Because we who represent the people live a portion of our lives in Canberra, we do get to know some of the people who live in Canberra, and to mix with them. We learn what the Canberra colony is all about and how the bureaucracy works&mdash;or does not work&mdash;in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming as I do from a background in the building and construction industry, I have for a long time had concerns about how the development process works in the ACT. It seems to me that, to some extent, we have a case of bureaucracy gone mad at times. In order to get a building permit, an architect whom I know well sometimes has to draw plans four, five, six or seven times to meet unclear guidelines and to meet the personal whims of the particular person who will certify plans and allow them to proceed. He has to meet the requirements of unknown people behind the scenes whom he never gets to meet. The liability is huge, and that liability, of course, adds to the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is a well&hyphen;known, well&hyphen;established architect who understands the basics of good building construction and good design and wins national awards year after year. Can you imagine how disheartening it is to have to design a building and then redesign it and redesign it to meet criteria which keep shifting hour by hour, day by day, week by week and, sometimes, month by month? It is taking an incredible amount of time to get approval and to get a building permit to actually go ahead and build the buildings that my friend, the architect, so capably designs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So perhaps this is an appropriate time to say generally to the ACT government that it is time to allow the private sector a little bit more leeway. We have never really proven that a person trying to act for the benefit of everyone else in creating regulations really does a better job for those people than the people would do for themselves. We can create rules and then build on the rules, because we do not like the shape or size or colour of a particular building. We can say, `Well, the ceilings must be no lower than eight feet,' or `They must be no higher than nine feet,' or `You must have five trees in the front garden and you must have a circular <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4071"> pathway.' This is all nonsense. It is regulation gone mad and the bureaucracy acting to feed upon itself. Perhaps that occurs somewhat because of insecurity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time, surely, for the ACT government to look at its regulatory authority with respect to building construction, to try to give a little bit more latitude to those who so capably design the buildings that grace this fair city and make it work so well to provide comfort, housing and good working conditions for the people of Canberra, for the people who come to visit and for us, who are indeed temporary residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government brought this bill before the parliament in good faith and I am pleased that the opposition will support it. I commend the bill to the Main Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, in 1994 when officers of the Australian Public Service were compulsorily transferred to the ACT Government Service, the provisions of the Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Act 1994, the ACTGS act, were introduced to allow ACT officers to apply for selection on merit for positions advertised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> as vacancies in the Australian Public Service. Similar provisions are made in ACT legislation for Australian Public Service officers to apply for ACT vacancies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 1 July 1995 the Australian Capital Territory government corporatised ACT Electricity and Water&mdash;ACTEW&mdash;and compulsorily transferred ACTEW employees from the ACT Government Service to a new company, ACTEW Corporation. As a consequence, the corporation employees were no longer covered by the terms of the ACTGS act mobility arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July 1995 the committee agreed with the ACT Chief Minister to extend the mobility provisions for a period until 30 June 1998 to the employees of the corporation who lost the mobility rights when they were compulsorily transferred from the ACT Government Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes an amendment in those terms to enable the reinstatement of certain staff mobility arrangements between the ACT Government Service and the Australian Public Service. The amendment adds a regulation making power to the act, to permit modification to the ACT Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Act 1994 and to any other act in relation to a matter arising from an ACT officer becoming an employee of a body corporate controlled by the territory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion. The purpose of the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 is to reform the Commonwealth's procedure for making, scrutinising, publishing, amending and repealing subordinate legislation. The bill consolidates into one act existing procedural requirements which are found in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903. The measures will essentially allow a greater scrutiny of, and public access to, delegated legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has a number of primary aims: firstly, defining more clearly and comprehensively the forms of subordinate legislation subject to parliamentary review and disallowance; secondly, allowing the Attorney&hyphen;General to issue a certificate in specified circumstances to clarify the nature of an instrument; thirdly, establishing a single register of delegated legislation, with legislative instruments only being enforceable if they are on the register; fourthly, introducing public notice and consultation procedures for changes to delegated legislation affecting business; fifthly, providing for the back&hyphen;capture or updating of existing subordinate legislation and its placement on the public register; sixthly, introducing automatic sunsetting provisions requiring all legislative instruments to be reviewed every five years; seventhly, providing for parliamentary scrutiny of all forms of delegated legislation, with each instrument to be tabled in each house of parliament within six days of registration; and, finally, making consequential amendments to other related acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The background to the legislation is that at present there are very few limitations on the power of the Commonwealth parliament to make delegated legislation, which takes the form of rules and regulations by subordinate bodies, including statutory authorities, administrative tribunals and, most relevantly, the executive. Existing limitations, such as they are, are derived from the fact that Commonwealth legislation must be based upon or reasonably incidental to some constitutional power, such as the numerous heads of power contained in section 51 or section 52, or even section 122, of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, the principle in respect to delegated legislation is one predicated on the fact that we have, in this country, and very fortunately, a system of responsible government. That is found in a number of constitutional heads, including section 1, which provides that the legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in the federal parliament, which consists of the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives. Section 7 provides for the democratic election of senators and section 24 provides for the democratic election of members of the House of Representatives. The constitution quite clearly in a number of sections is based on the principle of representative democracy in a form involving direct popular election and the principle of responsible government as reflected in sections 62 and 64 of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is apparent from the constitution is that government is quite literally meant to be by a parliament directly accountable to its popular mandate. Indeed, that has never been doubted. This system of responsible government has been referred to in a number of High Court cases as pervading the constitution, and fortunately so. One of the earlier statements was in the famous Boilermakers case: R. v. Kirby, ex parte the Boilermakers' Society of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been, over the years, great difficulty in determining just when delegated legislation falls into the category of being a statutory instrument of an administrative nature and when it has a legislative character. In a recent case in Sanyo Australia Pty Ltd v. Comptroller&hyphen;General of Customs, the High Court said that the case emphasised:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4073">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the distinction between legislation which in general involves the laying down of general rules which have legal and binding effect and the taking of administrative action which, insofar as it has legal and binding effect, is taken in execution or application of the law and, insofar as it lays down general rules, tends not to have a legally binding effect but to lay down rules in the nature of policy or of guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That statement of principle is a correct judicial pronouncement, but the difficulty comes in applying it. This bill will go quite some way to resolving the uncertainty in assessing and applying delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental restriction on the legality of delegated legislation is the fact that parliament cannot delegate its legislative power. It cannot simply abdicate, to statutory authorities or to ministers, the power to make laws. But if one analyses a number of acts of parliament one finds there are very wide powers given. Indeed, the research section of the library has referred to a number of those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, section 70 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act gives the Governor&hyphen;General power to make regulations required or permitted by that act to be prescribed, or necessary or convenient to be prescribed, for carrying out or giving effect to that act, which is an extremely broad delegation indeed. Item 20 of the schedule to the Excise Tariff Act refers to the imposition of an excise as prescribed by departmental law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 59 of the Federal Court of Australia Act allows the judges of the court, or a majority of them, to make rules of court governing procedure and other administrative matters. Those rules and procedures go a very substantial way to determining how justice is administered and, indeed, what sorts of remedies can be given. That is also a very broad delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further example is contained in section 180 of the Migration Act, which gives the minister special power to refuse or cancel a visa or entry permit. We, as members of parliament, would have seen the width with which that power has been exercised. In summary, it is essential that there be a regime of more closely scrutinising delegated legislation and, indeed, having public input before delegated legislation is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the history of this legislation goes back quite some years. Proposals for a legislative instruments bill arose in 1992 with the Administrative Review Council's report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rule making by Commonwealth agencies</EMPHASIS>. The council found that delegated legislation varied in quality and was inaccessible and obscure. It recommended the enactment of a legislative instruments act to address the problems that it had found and reported on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A bill substantially based on that report was introduced in the Senate and read a first time on 30 June 1994. It was subsequently referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. That committee presented its report to the Senate on 17 October 1994. The committee endorsed the objectives of the bill and generally supported its main principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response was tabled on 8 November 1994 and the bill was read a second time in the Senate on 9 November 1994. The bill was subsequently deferred, and the government agreed not to proceed until the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs had reported on the bill. A speaker who will be succeeding me, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), and, indeed, the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), both had considerable input on that committee. That committee was also asked to report on the proposed government amendments, some of which responded to the recommendations of the Senate regulations and ordinances committee report and other related matters.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4074">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, however, was awaiting passage prior to the 1996 election. The bill as moved by the government essentially derives from that bill although, it must be said, with some additional modifications. The current bill draws on those earlier reports, and the main features it adds are sunsetting and a more structured consultation regime. It is appropriately a shift of control over delegated legislation back to the parliament, and increases government accountability through improved access and consultation mechanisms. It is consistent with those High Court authorities and constitutional provisions, to which I referred earlier, regarding the concept of responsible government which pervades our constitution and the concept of government by the people through their elected representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will apply the same regime to all delegated legislative instruments, instead of the varying requirements that presently apply. The bill's coverage is determined by a definition of a legislative instrument essentially based on the legislative character of the instrument and goes some way to clarifying the extent of appropriate delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Attorney&hyphen;General noted in his second reading speech, the bill introduces a mandatory consultation procedure for instruments directly affecting business or having a substantial indirect effect on business. Consultation will ensure the consideration of all relevant issues before the delegated legislation is made. However, this is perhaps one area where there is some criticism, from my perspective, of the bill in that there is no logical reason to so restrict the scope of consultation. I note, however, that the minister has referred to this being, if you like, a trial or limited operation for the present time and its broadening may well be subject to further consideration. I sincerely hope that will be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I note the government is anxious to indicate to small business that it is keen on reducing the extent of regulation, which we would also support, it is important not to become one&hyphen;eyed or too limited as a result of the desire to present that image. The minister in fact said that, in light of the experience gained in the more targeted approach to small business issues, it may well be expanded. Again, I would encourage the Attorney&hyphen;General to take that course of action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of access to legislative instruments is one which is welcomed. From my point of view as a legal practitioner, I can say that it was quite frequently a nightmare advising clients, particularly in areas which were a little out of the mainstream where there were no services updating developments. More than one solicitor over time has got into trouble by providing advice to their client only to find&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SMITH" NAMEID="SK6">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SK6">Mr Tony Smith</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One or two counsels, too!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JK6">Mr McCLELLAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I would certainly agree that more than one or two counsel have got into trouble in advising their clients with all the best will and every due diligence, only to find that some regulation or rule had been passed which fundamentally shifted the thrust of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A common example has been that in various taxation areas legislative instruments have fundamentally altered the criteria for selection for the assessing or enforcement of taxation imposts. So again this concept of access, when access itself is based upon the departments bringing regulations up to date before they are put on the public register, will considerably advance the quality of legal advice which can be provided and will provide a ready measure as to competence. Any lawyer who advises a client in a particular area without first checking that public register would be very foolish indeed. In that context I see the public register operating in much the same way as, for instance, the REVS program, when one checks on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4075"> whether a car is encumbered by a mortgage or whether any charge applies. That can be done immediately when someone is purchasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are very significant advances. This is an indication of government keeping pace with developments, not only in terms of the impact that federal law has on the operation of government generally but also by keeping pace with technology. The reference in legislation to the existence of a public register which utilises that technology is a significant advance and is to be encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wholeheartedly support the legislation. In fairness to the Attorney&hyphen;General, I note that he indicated that it was substantially based on the history of developments to which I have referred in this speech. I know he will not praise himself but, again, one of the speakers to follow me, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), had a considerable input into the development of the concepts which are now contained in the bill. Again I indicate my support for the proposal.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very proud day for the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), I would imagine. Of all the people in this parliament he is pre&hyphen;eminent in his press to have the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs examine in detail the legislative instruments legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the presence in the Committee of the former chairman of that House of Representatives committee, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), and I want to pay tribute also to him because he was a very fine chairman of the committee. In my opinion, he and the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), of Labor Party membership, exemplified the finest traditions of chairmanship of parliamentary committees. It was through the preparedness of the member for Banks as chairman of that committee, and also through the far&hyphen;sightedness and enthusiasm of the member for Tangney, the now Attorney&hyphen;General, that we moved to examine this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased with the results of that and I think that the member for Banks would have to acknowledge that it is a nice turn of events&mdash;in more ways than one, particularly for those on this side of the House&mdash;that the Labor Party introduced this legislation, took the first step and followed through on the recommendations of the tribunal. I think that the Administrative Review Council's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rule making by Commonwealth agencies</EMPHASIS> sparked the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It determined to do something, because the whole process of law-making in Australia in this area&mdash;delegated law&mdash;has been a mess; complicated and deadly for practitioners. People have unexpectedly been trapped, and there was uncertainty for us as law-makers in many instances. It had become the practice of the previous government to put framework legislation in place and dump the real substance of legislation into regulations or delegated instruments. That process meant that there was real uncertainty on our part in making laws. It did, in fact, give the bureaucracy more free rein than sense dictated it should have; but it also meant that there was great uncertainty for those recipients and so-called beneficiaries of our laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The meeting together of a chairman of the legal and constitutional affairs committee and a fine legal mind from Western Australia, in the form of Mr Daryl Williams, QC, meant that we were able to conduct a very far&hyphen;reaching inquiry in that committee. It was done with the utmost goodwill, with us all seeking to tease out what were the relevant points, and with the report being tabled in the parliament in 1995.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4076">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a response to the Labor Party's Legislative Instruments Bill of 1994. The bill was awaiting passage in the Senate when the parliament was prorogued prior to the 1996 election.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, the Labor Party introduced the legislation. It wanted to clarify and improve the rule&hyphen;making process. The chairman of the House of Representatives committee, encouraged very strongly by the member for Tangney, picked up this piece of legislation. We dealt with it as a committee and made a number of very important suggestions, some of which were adopted by the government of the day. Unfortunately in some ways, that legislation lapsed because of the elections. That has given the person who was the driving force in looking at these issues the opportunity now, as Attorney&hyphen;General, to come forward and put his own blush, his own colour, his own life into this legislation. I think that is a wonderful turn of events as far as this legislation is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst, as the previous speaker said, it is a tentative step, few people in Australia would have considered, with the detail and discernment that the member for Tangney has, the need for reform of legislative instruments. Now we have come up with a solution that I think is going to greatly improve the processes of regulation making and legislative instruments in Australia. There will be clearer definitions of regulation-making powers and a greater clarity to everything that governments will be doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General can be excused for trumpeting, in the handouts, the main benefits of this legislation. What he is saying is that it is going to improve public access to all delegated legislation through an electronic register of all legislative instruments. That alone will be a fabulous thing. It will allow people to actually know the rules they are working on, whether it be on building sites under Commonwealth law, whether it be on food regulations or whether it be on importations. In the Customs area alone, this is a far-sighted decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His second point of favour for this legislation is the mandatory consultation before legislative instruments affecting business are made. This was one of the platforms of the coalition before we went to the election. We said that we needed to simplify the rules and laws for small business. Nobody would think that a piece of dry legislation like this would be one of the very important parts of that process, but it is. The Attorney&hyphen;General has picked it up and he has enunciated this factor as being one of the most important aspects of the need for us in this country to have a law covering legislative instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Williams, the Attorney&hyphen;General, has been able to write the consultation process into the legislation. That is very important because unless those who are affected by rules are consulted we get all sorts of anomalies and unworkable situations, and even the circumstance from time to time where the unscrupulous can take advantage of oversights. We need to have this consultation and I think that is excellent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to measures to improve drafting quality, that is an endless process and it is one that all members of parliament would endorse anyway. I think enhanced parliamentary scrutiny is something that the committee wanted and I know the member for Banks felt that improved scrutiny was needed. That original report was such a good report. There was complete consultation and there was also consensus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision for a five&hyphen;year sunsetting of legislative instruments is something that the Labor Party was not able to agree to but Mr Williams, as the new Attorney, has brought that through. I am pleased with the amendments that are here today which change the five&hyphen;year sunset to some extent. The reason that that five&hyphen;year sunset clause had to be changed is really obvious. For example, very significant protocols, such as quarantine protocols may take, as members <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4077"> would know, three to five years to develop. There are some people involved in the chicken industry debate later this day who would hope that those protocols are never established, and it will take us a million years to settle those protocols. Great care is needed to settle protocols.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A 15&hyphen;year sunset provision for exporting industries, particularly where they affect quarantine processes, is needed. These things take a long time to examine. You can draw on expert information from around the world&mdash;the scientific process undertaken, the decisions and the debate and, of course, consultation, can take five years. Therefore, a five-year process of establishing a protocol for the reasons of quarantine well justifies a 15&hyphen;year sunset clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is a great piece of legislation. It moves in the direction that I think every member of the committee wanted us to move and I think that most members of the parliament would appreciate it. If they were aware of the brilliant work that was done by that committee, they would be applauding the members of it. Unfortunately, such is the nature of this place that our colleagues do not always appreciate the excellent work that we do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by pointing out that in 1990 there were about 1,424 decisions of a legislative type. They were not passed through the parliament. They were usually placed on the table and if anybody objected they were dealt with. But it was not possible to amend; it was only possible to accept or reject those instruments. They used to just flick through the House and nobody was any the wiser. A former senior officer of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department drew attention to this problem of the large amount of secondary legislation. Professor Curtis, in evidence to the committee, said that this is in contrast to the earlier practices of using regulations by the Governor&hyphen;General as the basic form of delegated legislation. We have departed from that process in many instances rather than only in special circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Curtis has also asserted that the many forms of delegated legislation that now take place means that the convenience of the bureaucracy is met and that that has been allowed to transcend the convenience of the public. That is the reason for this legislation. I applaud the Attorney&hyphen;General. I thank the chamber and I look forward to hearing the comments of the former chairman of the House of Representatives legal and constitutional affairs committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, I want to commend the officers from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department who have maintained a consistent carriage in relation to this bill. This is not one of those bills that one could describe as a sexy bill&mdash;one that members of the public get excited about&mdash;but it really is integral to the function of our parliamentary democracy.

The measures are aimed at allowing greater scrutiny of, and public access to, delegated legislation. That is important for decision makers. It is important for those who are interested in what decisions are made and for those who are drafting decisions. It is important for the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the subject of a parliamentary committee, not only in the Senate, but also in the House of Representatives, which I chaired. It was notable, again, that that parliamentary committee <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4078"> produced a unanimous report. It had support across the parties, and it did not just toe the government line. It made a number of substantial recommendations that we felt would improve the bill. A number of those recommendations were taken up, and some were discarded. There have been some amendments in the current bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the opposition's point of view, we have encouraged an expedited passage of this bill, and we will be expediting it through the House of Representatives. We will not be moving any amendments, but I do telegraph that the current shadow Attorney&hyphen;General does have some reservations and some matters that he wants to discuss with the government. That process, one hopes, will take place in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is concerned about retaining parliamentary review, as well as ADJR review. It was noted that the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the 1994 bill recommended that parliamentary review should be maintained. That is something that he will be taking up with current the Attorney&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am of the view that some of these concerns can be worked through because I think there is goodwill on all sides. Some of the concerns are just a matter of degree. In some instances it is six of one and half a dozen of the other; we are all trying to achieve the same result. The truth is that here we have complex legislation where everyone is trying to achieve the same objects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some compromises. I know, for instance, that the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department takes a more radical line in terms of scrutiny than other departments do. We have a fairly conservative PM&amp;C, and there are other departments that, obviously, would like a more conservative line. There have been some compromises in relation to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General has asked me to mention is that he is not keen on the changes allowing ADJR review of the consultation process. The view is that this process will be considerably more onerous than the one stage, post&hyphen;development consultation process required by the 1994 bill. The 1994 bill did not permit ADJR review of that process. The current shadow Attorney&hyphen;General's view is this consultation process may be too prescriptive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this provision is merely to indicate best practice, not to provide a means by which the making of legislative instruments could be frustrated. It is felt that, to this extent, the two&hyphen;stage process could be permitted as demonstrating a higher minimum standard. However, it would also provide organised lobbies with an enforceable right of consultation not afforded to the general community. It is also felt that ADJR review could be used by an organised lobby as a means to frustrate the making of legislative instruments. But, again, it is a matter of degree, and I am sure the discussions will take place with goodwill when the bill proceeds to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other matter I have been asked to mention. The current bill has an exemption: where the instrument is required in the interests of national security, no certification is required by the Attorney. My understanding from the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General is that he would prefer certification by the Attorney&hyphen;General if the instrument is required in the interests of national security. Those are the only matters that I wish to raise and I have done so in a general manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make is that there is a new player. We are now in opposition. It is not a question of reversing our earlier support for the bill; it is just one of those transitional arrangements. That is, sadly, part of the tortuous passage of this bill. I think these proposals <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4079"> can be talked through when the matter goes to the Senate and I am sure that the government will have an open mind. We have the benefit now of a number of reports by parliamentary committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just repeat what I said earlier&mdash;it has been a tortuous path. I know that we tried to get the previous bill finalised before the election and we were unsuccessful because, as I say, I think it was not sexy enough for some people to give it priority. That is a sad thing. I do commend the role of all the players, particularly those officers who have provided the support structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that my parliamentary committee was afforded invaluable assistance by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, with a seconded officer. The secretariat of the parliamentary committee was sensational in providing a support structure and guidance for us members of parliament who sometimes take for granted the excellent support structure we have. I certainly commend the main thrust of the bill to the parliament, with those reservations that I say are genuine ones and that I am sure can be worked through.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996. It is particularly appropriate in my view that I refer to comments made by the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) when he was in opposition and, as the member for Tangney, said in 1995:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extensions of individual rights in relation to executive action affecting the individual have not been matched by any major reforms in the legislative process. Even those modest changes (public inquiries by the Senate committees into bills) have no counterpart in the making of delegated legislation where the interests of the citizen have increasingly been sacrificed to governmental and bureaucratic convenience. The volume of secondary legislation has grown, the variety of forms of it has multiplied, the impact of it has become more and more significant, and the ability of citizens to access it has lessened.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>With respect, I fully endorse those comments. It is very encouraging to see this bill following on from, as has been pointed out by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) and others, a tortuous prehistory. There has been a determination by the Attorney to see this measure through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a complex bill. As the member for Banks said, on its face it is not particularly attractive in a public sense, but in reality it effects a very important legislative task in the overall context of the plethora of legislation by way of statutory and legislative instruments. It is interesting to look at some comparison between the statutory rules and total instruments as at 1982&hyphen;83, standing at 703, and as at 1995, standing at 2,239. That is about a 300 per cent increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all of that going on it is becoming more and more impossible&mdash;in my legal practice I noticed it, certainly at a state level&mdash;not only for the purposes of the public but also for the lawyers, in particular, to advise their clients properly because of the difficulty in interpreting some of these instruments and, furthermore, gauging their possible impact, as well as in some cases merely finding them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall specifically having to advise a client in relation to a matter arising out of a possible negligence against the main roads department. It was very simple, when I started at the bar, to identify the person to be sued&mdash;it was simply the Commissioner for Main Roads, and had been for many years. All of that changed under the Goss government and there was a plethora of legislative instruments which led a practitioner on an enormously difficult task of trying to find who had replaced the Commissioner for Main Roads as the entity to be sued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My particular example, as the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) mentioned, did end in some peril but luckily it was retrievable. Nonetheless, it required an application to the court <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4080"> because, when I had assured myself and had been advised by other members of my chambers that I had got the right entity, unfortunately we discovered that yet another entity had replaced that entity in a period of six weeks, without any sign of that being readily to be found. It led to an application to the court to correct the name. That is just one small example, but one of the largest complaints that occurred when I was in practice was the fact that in the last few years, in particular, the difficulty of accessing those sorts of instruments and advising on them has been becoming greater and greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a broader sense, it would be well for the Commonwealth to look at providing a far better annotation service generally than it has hitherto provided in relation not only to instruments, perhaps, but also in particular to Commonwealth acts, because that is another such area. I will not stray into that territory during this debate because it could occupy me for a rather lengthy period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw the attention of the Main Committee to one particular matter that perhaps I am being overcautious about. Clause 28(1)(iii) speaks of circumstances in which compliance with sections 20 to 25 is not required. That relates to the particular area that interested me, where it says that the instrument:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . merely meets an obligation of the Commonwealth under an international agreement by repeating or adopting the terms of all or part of an instrument for which the agreement provides or to which the agreement makes reference . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do wonder why that particular exception was put in there. As a member of the treaties committee, and it is a very active committee, I am interested to know what the rationale was for putting that there, or perhaps it is merely a matter that ought not to really excite my interest because it is purely an administrative or a reflection type of measure, rather than an adoption of any sort of adventurous, if you like, means of avoiding clauses 20 to 25.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to mention the rules of court area. I note that clause 7 provides that the rules of court are not legislative instruments. I understand that the rationale behind that is that the independence of the judiciary may be compromised if executive government rules regarding the making of subordinate legislation were imposed on the courts. However, I caution a little on that particular area, without wishing to transgress or trespass upon the essential import of that clause. From time to time rules of court are promulgated and they follow, generally speaking, discussions between committees of the Bar Association and the Chief Justice or other judges who have been authorised to involve themselves in those discussions. At times, I have seen rules of court promulgated that I have wondered about in terms of their public effect, and I think there is a case for saying that there should be a mechanism&mdash;and there may well be&mdash;by which the executive and the parliament as well could have some role, be it through a committee recommendation or something of that nature, whereby if at least a relevant standing committee could look at a proposed rule of court it may be that there would be a wider community input than the narrow one now, without at all trespassing upon or compromising the independence of the judiciary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased, however, to see the register and the fact that again that provides a very real public and open element to this particular area. The bill will also have an impact, in my view, in reducing compliance costs incurred by business and others subject to government regulation. The bill has a very important function to serve, as has been indicated, but it will not be one that will be readily greeted with adulation by most of my constituents. In reality, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4081"> when problems arise with some of these instruments it is immediately a matter that is sheeted home to us as legislators if we are not prepared to provide adequate safeguards when these instruments come into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, I am very heartened by this measure. As a new member, I am pleased to see that these matters are being addressed. They have been difficult in their embryonic stages and in bringing them to fruition, but we have got there, in my view. I wholeheartedly endorse this bill, with the fairly minor reservations I have mentioned.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Legislative Instruments Bill 1996, which was introduced by the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) on 26 June, sets out a regime for determining drafting standards and procedures for the making, registration, publication, scrutiny and sunsetting of delegated legislation. The bill defines the term `legislative instrument', specifically excludes particular instruments and provides a method by which an Attorney&hyphen;General's certificate can be issued to resolve doubt about whether the application of the definition is unclear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition announced in its small business policy, prior to the last election, that it was committed to strengthening the legislative instruments bill which was introduced by the former Labor government. As such, the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 relates very much to the hopes and aspirations advocated by the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill includes several features to which I want to draw attention, such as the development and maintenance of an electronic register of all delegated legislation, to which the public will have access; mandatory consultation before legislative instruments affecting business are made; measures to improve drafting quality; enhanced parliamentary scrutiny; and provisions for five&hyphen;year sunsetting of legislative instruments to ensure continued relevance. In particular, the inclusion of a five&hyphen;year sunsetting of new regulations, which was promised in the coalition's small business policy, is most welcome and highly commendable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, in my opinion, represents a great leap forward in the present situation, and of course I support it wholeheartedly. My own reservation&mdash;like the previous speaker's, but in a different direction&mdash;is that it does not go far enough. There are currently 209 pages of regulations in force under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. It is beneficial for small business in particular that these regulations face review every five years. But they were only a fraction of the real level of regulation faced by all taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business&mdash;as you are only too well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;is burdened with over 3,800 pages of income tax law and some 970 income tax rulings. The tax acts themselves are riddled with discretionary power in the hands of the Commissioner of Taxation which, in the ordinary course of his business, he delegates throughout the Australian Taxation Office. In addition, there are over 1,600 additional pages of tax laws, 397 sales tax rulings, and other tax rulings and determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although these additional rulings and determinations are not regulations in the strictest sense, they seem to me, in many if not all cases, to serve exactly the same purpose. They clarify the law, in other words. The purpose of them is not only to clarify the law, but also to give the Australian Taxation Office's opinion on what the law means and how certain tax matters will be treated. There are actually two types of rulings: public and private. Public rulings may apply generally to all taxpayers, while private rulings relate to specific tax matters brought to the attention of the ATO by a single or individual taxpayer.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4082">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public rulings and determinations should be, in my humble submission, Mr Deputy Speaker, subject to the same scrutiny as regulations and hence the source of my remarks and concern. Although not law or delegated legislation in a stricter sense, the ATO applies these rulings as if they were law. Where an individual disagrees with a ruling by the ATO, the only recourse is to challenge it in the courts on the ground that it is inconsistent or contrary to the relevant tax act. If the ATO holds its rulings and determinations up as law, then they should be subject to the same degree of scrutiny to which regulations are subject. They should be treated as regulations, face disapproval by either house of parliament and have five&hyphen;year sunset clauses, entirely consistent with the legislation before the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its report no. 326, handed down in November 1993, recommended amongst other things that all public tax rulings should go through a formal approval process. To avoid uncertainty about whether a ruling is private or public, all public rulings should be gazetted. Parliament should have a supervisory role and there should be the creation of a publicly available register consolidating all determinations in public and private rulings as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those ways, it is not dissimilar to what the government sets out to do with this legislation. As Michael Dirkis wrote in the International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation's publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, the Joint Committee, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">recommended that all public rulings should be tabled in the parliament within five days of gazettal, allowing the parliament to evaluate and analyse them and respond to unsatisfactory rulings.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the responsibility of the parliament to make the laws of this land. All public rulings and determinations should be subjected to parliamentary scrutiny to ensure that they comply with the parliament's will and its interpretation of the meaning of how its laws should be interpreted and applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commissioner of Taxation should not have, in other words, the unfettered right to draft tax rules. In a democratic state, binding rules of a tax nature should only be established with the approval of the parliament or, at the very least, a right to disallow. `No taxation without representation' is enshrined by way of principle in Anglo&hyphen;Saxon nations, as it is in the United States. Charles I lost his head over this very issue, Mr Deputy Speaker, when he tried to raise taxes without the approval of the parliament and, of course, George III lost the American colonies over the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the tax commissioner is not at risk of losing his head over this and neither are any ministers, he and they certainly deserved to lose any ability to bypass this accountability to the parliament. Let us be frank&mdash;the commissioner and the Australian Taxation Office have been overzealous on many occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ability of the parliament to disallow tax rulings is also part of a wider need to protect our citizens against the arbitrary power of the government and its agencies. For too long, power has been usurped by the executive at the expense of the parliament. This is part of a wider democratic deficit. Sir Ninian Stephen used that term to describe the use of international treaties to transfer power from national to supranational bodies.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, indeed. This term can be just as appropriately used to describe the executive's increasing willingness to impose rights and responsibilities on Australian citizens without parliament's prior knowledge or consent. This is a development which should be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4083"> wound back, and tax rulings are a good place to begin. This legislation might be a vehicle for doing just that&mdash;by subsequent amendment, of course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of determinations and tax rulings which are currently being issued at the tax commissioner's discretion is increasing every day, as we all know only too well. It is no surprise then that Australia's tax system is amongst the most complex and expensive in the Western world to comply with, with all its implications for small business; which complexity and cost of compliance this bill is but a small part of trying to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complexity simply adds, in a way which is almost unique in the world, to the cost of doing business, and it is a deterrent to the growth of employment. It is a serious obstacle to establishing a small business. Compliance costs are absolutely regressive, and all affect small taxpayers, particularly unincorporated self&hyphen;employed business men and women, to a much larger extent than perhaps they affect larger firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Taxation Office continues to issue tax rulings in a manner which runs contrary to the philosophy of the Howard government of reducing regulations on small business. The tax commissioner's discretionary powers are adding to both the complexity of our tax laws and the burgeoning costs of compliance. The present federal government promised the small&hyphen;business community that it would slash, by some 50 per cent in its first term, the amount of government generated paper work that small business had to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) has established the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, the National Small Business Summit, the Micro&hyphen;business Consultative Group and the Office of Small Business. It is only early days, but it is unfortunate that that particular minister is already backtracking from the coalition's commitments by creating a bureaucratic structure to handle promptly that which it should have had the capacity to initiate from within its own ranks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;More committees and endless consultations are no substitute for general reform. One would have thought that, after 13 years in opposition and all the waffle&mdash;I was part of it&mdash;you would know what to do when you got in, after those 13 years. What you have done is embark on a formula for delay. It is time that the government addressed the real issues, rather than paying lip&hyphen;service to the needs of small business. It is the same lip&hyphen;service that we saw so much of under the previous government. The fringe benefits tax has compliance costs which are at least six times higher than those in New Zealand. The wholesale sales tax ranges from zero per cent to 200 per cent, in the case of some alcoholic beverages, and consequently is a nightmare to administer. The Building Owners and Managers Association, in its submission to the Productivity Commission's review of micro&hyphen;economic reform stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of complying with the Australian taxation system is a major obstacle to earning assessable income and investment. In the recent past, new legislation and rulings have had little regard for the compliance burden placed on business. Reducing the costs of compliance must be the first priority of micro&hyphen;economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA>As long as we have a tax office which is more interested in wringing every single dollar out of business and in drafting what is sometimes the most ludicrous and difficult legislation or set of tax rulings to comply with, we will continue to face high compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have one of the most archaic tax systems in the Western world and, of course, along with others, I join in claiming that a complete review of tax policy is required. The Howard government needs to get serious about getting government paperwork and impediments off <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4084"> the back of the proprietors of small businesses. Small businesses, as we know, offer the best opportunity to reduce the unemployment level in this country. The Productivity Commission's July 1996 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industry brief</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small firms continue to drive employment growth in Australia. The latest estimates reveal that the small business workforce rose by 6.4 percent or 225,000 jobs in 1994&hyphen;95. This was well above the 3.9 percent employment growth in the economy as a whole over the same period. This growth continues a long&hyphen;term trend, with small businesses accounting for almost all the net 1.2 million new jobs in Australia over the last decade. Small firms now employ just under half of all Australian workers. Notably, between 1985&hyphen;86 and 1994-95, small businesses increased their share of employment in all sectors and now account for 45 percent or more of employment in all industries apart from mining and community services.</PARA>

Delegated legislation needs to be reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis, and the processes enabling review also need to be easily accessible to the public. If the coalition wants to get serious about tackling red tape, it needs also to look at other matters, such as tax rulings and determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's small business policy stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been, since 1983, an era of wasted opportunities and of shameless Labor government inaction on issues of paramount importance to the small business sector. The Labor government condones the swamping of small business under an unnecessary and continuous paper war. Labor's legacy to small business has been the proliferation of red tape and regulation, tax complexity and draconian industrial relations policy. Frustration, desperation and confusion add to the overall cost of lost management focus, detracting from the essential task of developing core business initiatives.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;It is pleasing to see that the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 has support across the chamber. It will provide an enhanced basis for parliamentary scrutiny of legislative instruments. It will, as a number of speakers have mentioned, return some role and responsibility to parliament from the executive in the making of delegated legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also brings into parliamentary view a considerable increase in the volume of material that will need to be considered in parliament. That, in itself, is likely to create other problems which will need to be addressed in the appropriate way. I think appropriate consideration needs to be given to the role of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. That <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4085"> has been a very important committee over the years. I believe that, with the passage of this legislation, it will become a bulwark for the community's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two houses, and the House of Representatives in particular, also have important roles in the scrutiny of instruments under the bill and that also will be a procedural matter to be looked at in the future. The willingness of the executive to allow motions for disallowance to be given appropriate debate will be a matter that will have to be considered by those controlling parliamentary business. It will also be a matter for the hard-pressed Senate in its dealing with its business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before turning to comment on some of the contributions made by members in debate, I join with others in commending a number of bodies who have been instrumental in the bill's reaching this stage and who have made important contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, I think it should be mentioned that the origin of the bill was a report of the Administrative Review Council going back to 1992. The chair of the committee at that time, Professor Cheryl Saunders, maintained an interest&mdash;although she subsequently ceased to be chair&mdash;and was a witness before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its consideration of the bill. I join with the member for Banks (Mr Melham) in commending the continued work of the officers of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department who have laboured mightily over this piece of legislation. There are two Senate committees that have considered the bill&mdash;the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. They have both delivered reports. Probably the most important report, however, is the one that is being mentioned most frequently in debate here&mdash;that of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That committee reported in September 1995 on the 1994 bill. I join with the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) in commending the member for Banks on his chairmanship of that committee, the committee members for their work and, I might add, the witnesses who appeared before it. I can recall some very valuable contributions made by experts which have been taken up in the report and are now reflected in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be necessary, I think, for virtually all arms of government to give serious consideration to the implications of this bill for the administration of the department. In addition, it will be necessary for each of the relevant Houses and for a number of committees to consider how the implications of this bill will be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank all the members who have spoken on this bill; each has supported the bill. A number have made some comments or criticisms, some more detailed than others. The member for Barton (Mr McClelland) raised the issue&mdash;it was probably a fairly obvious one&mdash;of why the consultation requirement is limited to business. I think this is a matter that has been addressed at considerable length in the deliberations that have preceded the debate in this House. There is very good reason for extension of the provisions of the bill to all aspects of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, recognisably, resistance in the public service to the introduction of such new requirements holus-bolus. The decision was taken fairly early on by the previous government that, as a first step, the act should extend its consultation requirements to legislation affecting business. While there are strong arguments for the view that it should apply to all legislation, we have maintained that decision and have strengthened the resolution that this bill should in due course be seen as inevitably applying to all departments and all aspects of government involved in the making of delegated legislation. The immediate impact on those areas affecting <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4086"> business will, I think, convince the other departments of the desirability of the consultation process for other forms of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks raised three points reflecting what he foreshadowed would be raised by the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General, Senator Bolkus, in debate in the Senate. It is a matter of some regret to me that the debate on those issues in this House is not full, in order for me to address those matters of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point mentioned was the Attorney&hyphen;General's certificate. I presume, given what the member for Banks was saying, that the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General has in mind the certificate, under clause 8 of the bill, as to whether a proposed instrument is a legislative instrument or not. There has been a lot of debate, particularly in the House of Representatives committee, as to the manner in which the certificate should be dealt with and, in fact, whether there should be a certificate at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The background to it is that it was felt, in the formulation of the bill, that many departments would have difficulty in determining whether an instrument was of a legislative character or not. In order to assist departments faced with that sort of decision, it was felt that some mechanism for determination ought to be introduced. The mechanism chosen was a certificate by the Attorney&hyphen;General as to whether an instrument was legislative or not in character. The question then arose as to how that should be reviewed or how that should be reviewable. A lot of debate went on as to whether that was a decision which should be subject to parliamentary disallowance or should be subject to judicial review. I think the initial view of the House of Representatives committee was that it should be subject to both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall some very interesting debate as to the nature of the decision of the Attorney&hyphen;General and whether that, in itself, would be a legislative act. It involved authorities such as Professor Stan Hotop, Professor Dennis Pearce and Professor Cheryl Saunders. I think, in the end, the committee ended up somewhat confused as to what the outcome should be. The view I formed&mdash;after reflecting considerably and then abandoning all the advice&mdash;was that the Attorney&hyphen;General's certificate should be seen simply for what it is: it is a legal opinion as to whether an instrument is legislative in character or not. It is, in effect, legal advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legal opinions, in my view, are not appropriate for parliamentary review. You cannot invite parliament to disallow an opinion because, in order to reach that opinion, it is really going to have to form a legal opinion itself. While it does that frequently, that is not an appropriate function for a corporate body such as the House or a committee of the House. It is a function that is undertaken with some difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act method of review is a process designed specifically to determine legal questions. On that basis, it seems to me that the Attorney&hyphen;General's certificate is very appropriately reviewable by the Federal Court on an ADJR application. It is on that basis that the bill now reflects that point of view: parliamentary disallowance is not provided for and ADJR review is contemplated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point raised by the member for Banks concerned the ADJR implications of the consultation process. There are a number of decisions of an administrative character to be made in the course of the consultation process, which have the potential to be brought under review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easy to assert that this could be used for stonewalling by a lobby group. But I think, on reflection, it is more of a floodgates argument than one with real meat. There are many situations where a determined opponent can bring an ADJR application for review of an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4087"> administrative decision. But, in the end, it is a matter that can be dealt with readily and quickly if it is without merit. If it is not without merit, then it is appropriate for it to be determined by the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For my part, I offer some scepticism to the suggestion that there will be blocking by lobby groups, where legislative instrument proposals are put forward. I recognise that it is certainly a possibility, but ADJR applications are legal proceedings in superior courts: they are not lightly brought and they are not lightly maintained and, in addition, they are quite expensive. I suggest that it would be appropriate for the ADJR freedom to be continued. In the review process that is contemplated within the three years of operation of the bill, that particular point can be examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point raised by the member for Banks on behalf of the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General, Senator Bolkus, related to the exemption from consultation of instruments required because of an issue of national security. The suggestion is made that there should be a certificate by the Attorney&hyphen;General. I really question whether that is likely to have any practical effect. The practical situation is that the issue of national security is likely to emanate from Foreign Affairs, Defence or perhaps even agencies within the Attorney&hyphen;General's portfolio. It is an issue that is of some significance and will obviously have to be the subject of a determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the ordinary course of events, under this piece of legislation, that determination would probably be made by either the Attorney&hyphen;General or a delegate of the Attorney&hyphen;General. It would be subject to judicial review under section 29 and, therefore, the effect of having a certificate of the Attorney&hyphen;General, which would be subject to judicial review, is already there. I really wonder whether there is any substance in the point, but perhaps we will have to wait until the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General details his argument in order for us to understand exactly what it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) referred to the exemption from consultations for certain instruments made in consequence of obligations of the Commonwealth under an international agreement&mdash;section 28(1)(3). This provides that the rule maker is not required to comply with the consultation provisions, if the rule maker is satisfied that the instrument merely meets an obligation of the Commonwealth under an international agreement by repeating or adopting the terms of all or part of an instrument for which the agreement provides, or to which the agreement makes reference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The background to this goes back to the House of Representatives committee report. It considered the provision in the 1994 bill, which was in different terms. In the 1994 bill, it was contemplated that consultation would not be necessary where an obligation is imposed on the Commonwealth under an international agreement to make a legislative instrument. It was a much broader provision, and the committee was opposed to one in those terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the committee has reported, however, there have been significant reforms effected by the coalition government to the treaty&hyphen;making processes, and there are significant mechanisms already in place for public consultation in relation to the entry into treaties. We have made provision for a treaties council, which will involve the states and territories and bodies making representations to them. We have made provision for the joint parliamentary treaties committee, which can review proposed international instruments, and for the tabling of proposed international instruments 15 days before they become binding on Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of that, there is significant opportunity for public consultation in relation to the entry into the obligation. That is not to say that that consultation will be the same as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4088"> consultation in relation to a proposed regulation that would implement the international obligation. But there is some overlap in what would be dealt with in the two consultation processes. All that is set out in the proposed section 28 to be exempted is an instrument that merely repeats or adopts verbatim, in effect, the terms of the agreement in question. It is a very narrow exemption, and I think that it meets the requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) also raised the issue of treaty obligations in his speech. I would suggest that the points he made would be met by the same arguments that I have sought to make to the point made by the member for Dickson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dickson also mentioned the rules of court. Again, the rules of court were the subject of some considerable debate before the House of Representatives committee. There was an argument raised whether it constituted an intrusion on judicial independence for the parliament to be involved in the making of rules of court. That argument, I think, was rightly rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not true to suggest that rules of court are exempt. Under schedule 4, there are fairly extensive provisions under the Industrial Relations Act amending the statutes relating to the Family Court and the Federal Court. These will have the effect of requiring consultation to be modified to some extent, but, in general terms, it will be of the same nature as applies to other regulations. In our submission that is appropriately covered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Curtin has made a speech cogently arguing that public and private rulings, which were exempt from the consultation process under schedule 1 of the act, should be covered. That is an argument that was aired&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ROCHER" NAMEID="ZI4">

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr WILLIAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Curtin corrects me. He is concerned only with public rulings. That is a matter which was aired at some length also in the House of Representatives committee. I would accept that there is considerable strength in the arguments he puts. The difficulty is, I think, that those rulings are increasingly voluminous and increasing in number. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS>  I am indebted to the Main Committee. The huge volume and the very specialist nature of the various rulings raise special considerations. There is no doubt that there is a strong case for a requirement of public consultation. It is one that I would not attempt to argue against. Equally, I would not attempt to argue against the impact of the production of the number of rulings and their length, and the content of those rulings on small business, as well as big business and individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in our desire to ensure that the Legislative Instruments Bill gets through quickly, we decided that it was appropriate to give further consideration to how the tax rulings might be dealt with. We have in contemplation, as was in contemplation by the previous government, a review of the operation of the bill within a three&hyphen;year period and, in the course of that time, we hope we can deal with tax rulings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a further problem which should be mentioned in relation to tax rulings. The need for such a huge number of tax rulings really arises out of the nature of the Income Tax Assessment Act and the related legislation itself. While one cannot be confident that the simplification writing program is likely to have major impact in the short term, it ought to have some impact which would obviate a need for the sorts of rulings that are required in the detailed provisions that exist in the present bill. That also is a matter that needs to be carefully considered in this context.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4089">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Member for Curtin can rest assured that as far as I and the government are concerned we are anxious to fulfil the coalition policy to ensure that the regulations that apply to business are reduced in effect, in cost and in delay. The reform of the tax rulings will be seen as an important part of that, in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I have dealt with each of the issues raised by the speakers, Mr Deputy Speaker. It may not be to the satisfaction of all the speakers; however, that is the answer that they will receive from me for the time being. I commend the bill to the House. I thank all those who spoke and supported the bill. I thank again all those who were involved in its genesis.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill has some history. I think that is true of a number of bills. That is why I think it is easy to mix it up because the same sorts of principles apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the legislation that we are dealing with does have cross&hyphen;party support. This demonstrates to the public that a lot of the clips they see on television are not necessarily the reality. All they see are politicians haggling, arguing and engaging in dissent. The truth is that the overwhelming majority of legislation that passes through this House is debated in a genuine spirit of goodwill and cross&hyphen;party support, which is generally achieved on a lot of legislation&mdash;and the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill is one case in point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was introduced on 8 March 1995 by the Labor government as the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill of 1995. On 28 June 1995, the bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. That committee recommended five amendments to the bill. It is interesting to note that there was a dissenting report by senators Abetz, Ellison and O'Chee. I mention that because that minority report has been repudiated not only by the previous Labor government but also by the current government, as it should be. I think that needs to be pointed out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think those three senators are starting to develop a bit of a reputation as the `three amigos'. If they continue, their reputation will probably move on to become the `three stooges'. I am not saying that they are not genuinely motivated, but the reality is that I think their comments are really without substance in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What needs to be pointed out here is that because their dissenting report was not accepted in the last parliament, they fired it off to the Senate legislation committee. Basically, the reservations that we have, not necessarily with the bill, were outlined in the minority report <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4092"> by Senator Bolkus and Senator McKiernan. I think it is worth quoting from their report in terms of some reservations that we have. It is the opposition's view that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney&hyphen;General should restore adequate funding to the Insolvency and Trustee Service of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The minority report pointed out that they were in agreement with the Credit Union Services Corporation of Australia who expressed their concern about the adequacy of funding for the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia&mdash;ITSA. Senators Bolkus and McKiernan noted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Attorney&hyphen;General pre&hyphen;empted a response to this concern by agreeing to cuts totalling $434,000 over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA>The other concern of Senators Bolkus and McKiernan, which is an opposition concern, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the decision of the Government to increase the rate of cost recovery for ITSA. These measures will raise an additional $22 million over 4 years. The minority believes that this measure is regressive. It calls upon the victims of bankruptcy, creditors, to pay more for services that they would otherwise wish not to require. This measure will particularly impact on small business and make them even more reluctant to engage in bankruptcy proceedings leaving them to carry a greater share of the cost to the community from bankruptcy.</PARA>
<PARA>Apart from those reservations, the opposition is in general agreement with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to reiterate that I for one appreciate the diligence of the current Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams). I appreciate the way he regularly attends the Main Committee, listens to the debate and offers constructive suggestions in reply. I think that is treating the Main Committee with the respect with which it should be treated. Too often&mdash;and I think this is true of the former government as well&mdash;parliamentary secretaries were delegated. I do not want to take away from parliamentary secretaries, but I do have an old&hyphen;fashioned view that if a minister has carriage of a particular bill, it is a matter of courtesy to the House and the Main Committee that the minister, if at all possible, should be present throughout the debate and should respond. I think that is something that is certainly the hallmark of this Attorney&hyphen;General and I commend him for it. I know he has the support across the chamber for the civility and courtesy that he has been extending to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not agree on everything and we are not going to agree on everything. That is not the nature of the business we are in. But we do accept that we have different views. I think that we are all on the same path. We might take different paths at times but it ends up with, I think, better legislation. I wanted to put that on the record. I do not think it can be said often enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe in the parliamentary process, the importance of parliament and the role of backbenchers having access to and input into legislation and being listened to by a minister. There is nothing more disconcerting, after all that effort which is put in by members of the back bench&mdash;and they can have an input&mdash;than to have that effort ignored. It is good to have a minister present. I have seen instances where suggestions have been taken up at a later stage. I commend the minister for that practice and, again, say that the opposition has no problem with supporting the bill. We, in effect, started it, but this government will finish it for us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. As a former businessman who for 13 years ran my own business and for eight years before that ran someone else's business, I can say to you that I have a very great interest in the changes that are being brought forward in this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a bit concerned at the remarks of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) who said that he thought this would be an impost on business. I could not disagree with him more. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4093"> This will mean a tremendous assistance for business, and small business, in general. I found the matter of bankruptcy, in regards to the people that I traded with when I was running someone else's company or when I was running my own company, one of the most frustrating and difficult things to try to work out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislative change will mean that there will be a one&hyphen;stop shop. There will not be the differences that currently occur between two separate federal bodies, each doing virtually the same thing, and people not knowing which one to go to or which one to refer to. It will also mean that people who are facing financial difficulties will be able to get some advice and will be able to know what is the best procedure for them to adopt to try to resolve the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say that probably the most important thing I see in this bill is the resolution of the question of the transfer of funds. At present, people who would normally be liable can go to a court and say that they have nothing when, in fact, they do. I felt considerable anger and frustration when I had my own business, when the directors of one of the companies I was dealing with told me that they just could not pay any more and that they had to declare themselves bankrupt. That is exactly what happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A week or so later, I was with my family for a short holiday up at Terrigal. I saw one of the directors, a woman, with her husband and their children, staying at Terrigal in a very up&hyphen;market hotel, a hotel that I certainly could not afford to stay at. I felt extremely angry that they were able to manipulate the system in such a way that they were not only able to get away with not paying what was owed to me, but they were also able to flaunt that in such a way that made me, and a lot of my friends in business, very angry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a degree of retrospectivity in this, and there is no doubt that it is part of it. I have always been against the concept of retrospectivity. But, there are some steps that could be taken retrospectively by those who could be facing financial difficulties and, as a result, it is absolutely necessary to try to balance these rorts that are being pulled by people who, frankly, are just not worth supporting in any way, shape or form. I think that this will mean that notice will be given that they cannot continue to act in the way that they have acted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the honourable member for Banks says that the opposition will be supporting the bill. I would like to also commend the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) on the detail in which he has presented the bill and the very strong manner in which he proposed this and supported it in our party room.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the Main Committee today on the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill. The purpose of this bill is to assist in the government's commitment to modernising the law on personal insolvency by amending the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill contains a key provision on something I feel fairly strongly about; that is, the tightening of the provisions dealing with those who divest themselves of property to third parties when they are facing bankruptcy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also contains many other significant amendments. The proposed amendments relate to four main areas. Firstly, these proposed amendments will make amendments to part 9 of the act, introducing a new form of insolvency arrangements, to be called `debt agreements', for low income debtors. This will allow registered trustees to process debt agreement proposals and to streamline procedures for accepting debt agreement proposals. It will also correct a drafting error in the formula for calculating the income threshold for debt agreement proposals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4094">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, item 356, which proposed section 204A, is omitted as a consequence of the High Court decision in the Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission case, with consequential amendments resulting from this change. These changes restore the current position regarding the effect of a special resolution of creditors where they have resolved that a person become a bankrupt. The proposed amendment states that following a creditor's resolution a debtor must present a debtor's petition or, if the debtor does not present a petition, a creditor must apply to the court for a subsequent order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, a minor amendment to sections 189A and 189B is proposed, to require reports to be provided to creditors following the giving of an authority under section 188 of the act. Lastly, it is also proposed that these amendments give legislative effect to the abolition of the Federal Court of Bankruptcy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill proposes a wide range of very important reforms to the Bankruptcy Act. These reforms are eagerly awaited by personal insolvency practitioners, and they will assist the community as a whole by introducing a more effective regime in this area. They will, in addition, provide for cheaper and simpler processes and a new alternative to bankruptcy, while also clarifying the law in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures proposed in this bill will streamline procedures and processes for trustees by introducing a new form of insolvency arrangement. They will also tighten up former transaction avoidance provisions, bringing about a major improvement in bankruptcy administration. The proposal of a one&hyphen;stop shop whereby certain administrative functions are transferred from the Federal Court to the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia will greatly assist persons contemplating bankruptcy in considering the options available to them. More importantly, debtors who voluntarily file for bankruptcy will have their cases dealt with more promptly and will need to file documents with only one agency. This will, in turn, reduce administrative costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is one which listens to the people. We understand and, indeed, appreciate the valuable contributions that can be made by insolvency professionals when determining how to best achieve improved, user&hyphen;friendly and less costly laws in this area. The ongoing establishment of a consultative forum, inviting key players from the insolvency sector to participate on a regular basis, will be of benefit to all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For most people contemplating or filing for voluntary bankruptcy, the point in their lives when they experience such a moment is often associated with anxiety. This, in turn, affects the social and economic security of not only the bankrupts but also their families. The very last thing that one needs at such a time is complicated laws, and the amendments proposed in this bill will help to lessen the burden and the trauma.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of cognate livestock industry bills is a sound and progressive approach to provide funding to the Australian Animal Health Council. I believe this reform package is most relevant at this time when the fundamentals of free market economic philosophy come face to face and match up with the reality of exotic diseases and with the necessity to keep our agricultural sector clean and disease free. Our nation is the world's largest supplier of beef to export markets and is by far the dominant supplier of wool in international trade. Just last week, our burgeoning wine industry reported record exports and production levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the `mother' of the Australian Animal Health Council&mdash;EXANDIS, the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council&mdash;in its final report before being subsumed into the AAHC in 1995, some 54 animal diseases were not currently present in Australia but could enter and threaten the livestock industry. Diseases such as the much dreaded foot&hyphen;andmouth, rinderpest, blue tongue, vesicular stomatitis, screw worm fly, African swine fever and hog cholera&mdash;or, as it is termed, classical swine fever&mdash;already pose great concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the federal member whose electorate has the largest concentration of chicken growers across Australia, I also point out that the virulent newcastle disease&mdash;the poultry industry's own version of foot&hyphen;and&hyphen;mouth&mdash;has, and can quite easily again, wreak havoc on our nation's doorstep. Ask the Tasmanian Salmon Growers Association about the potential diseases&mdash;at least 23&mdash;presently not gracing our shores if importers of uncooked and unsmoked Canadian salmon get the thumbs up, and about the repercussions for the rest of the Australian livestock and agricultural industry as outlined in a feature article in the Fairfax publication, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS>, on 8 September 1996. I seek leave to table that document and have it included in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Directing funds from the relevant levying arrangements for each of those industries to the AAHC is a necessary cost impost to keep the walls high and strong <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4099"> to halt exotic disease in its tracks at the farm gate. Importantly, this legislation will allow the agricultural industry to meet its funding obligations to the council. The statement holds: tomorrow, the Prime Minister, John Howard, will be publicly bringing to life a bold pre&hyphen;election commitment that will set our agricultural sector apart&mdash;from being a mere food bowl of pickings for the outside world to becoming the supermarket to Asia and beyond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our former Prime Minister spoke in platitudes to Asia, of forming strategic alliances as World War III&mdash;the trade war&mdash;moved from the trenches to the negotiation table. The trouble is that only sound strategic policy outcomes can truly reap the potential of growth that has, without argument, emerged in trade, particularly within the Asian basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member who proudly presides over an electorate which significantly contributes to the agricultural industry, putting food on the nation's table and valuable dollars towards the national accounts with our beef, dairy produce and chickens, and the adjacent magnificent Hunter Valley wineries, I know the significance of having a clean, indeed green, agriculture and export food sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As John Howard said in an address to the National Farmers Federation on 21 November 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ability to balance scientific, economic and environmental considerations is now paramount if we are to create a model of sustainable rural development  . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than viewing climatic conditions solely on the basis of drought and flood, hail and rain falling at the wrong time, we must also build on positive approaches such as clean food marketing programs which are based upon Australia's relatively unspoilt environment.</PARA>
<PARA>And he is spot on. With the initiation of reforms to the growing Asian market and the potential growth in fresh and processed food exports&mdash;not just to Asia, but to other new world economic growth centres, including India, the Middle East, central and eastern Europe, as well as our more traditional markets of western Europe and North America&mdash;our natural advantage, with a clean agricultural sector, is second to none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where the role of the AAHC will evolve. The Australian Animal Health Council emanated from the necessity to confront the delivery of animal health services in Australia, including the old chestnuts that previous and current legislators and bureaucrats had racked their minds over: the lack of cohesion and duplication of effort between the animal health services of the eight states and territories as well as an additional arrangement involving the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the lack of systematic involvement of industry generally in animal health issues has not assisted, given our status as an island nation, in its wish to keep out disease and effectively control it. The sensitivities and ever more complex and growing demands of international and domestic consumers for product safety and assurance in food seem to be forever rising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just a matter of weeks ago, evidence of diseased beef on the shop shelves in Japan was sending fractures through our exports of Aussie beef. At a time when our beef industry was already on the canvas it did not need another blow. On the domestic front, the salmonella in a recognised brand of peanut butter only highlighted how consumer confidence can wane&mdash;and rightfully so&mdash;if our agricultural sector does not continually get it right, from the farm site to the dining room plate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government got it partly right with the evolution of EXANDIS in 1990. Formed to address the threat of exotic animal diseases, its primary objective, as outlined in its final report before it came under the umbrella of the AAHC, was to awaken Australians to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4100"> dangers of exotic diseases. It is the anticipation of our government and the intent of the legislation to maintain and further strengthen the nation's preparedness for virulent exotic diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time this legislation was developed, the government was under intense pressure from the agricultural sector and agri&hyphen;industry to try for implementation by 1 July 1996, some two months ago. Raising the status of the package of reforms was unfortunately not achieved by ensuring that the levies would come into effect from the first day of the month and at least 30 days after the act commences, and by acknowledging that a retrospective application of levies will disadvantage producers, levy payers and intermediaries who collect the levies on the Commonwealth's behalf. A retrospective application would mean costs incurred are inevitably passed back onto industry. It will also impact on the funding of the AAHC as well as of associated industry bodies. The amendments halt the situation of cutting off your nose to spite yourself, by not allowing a lose&hyphen;lose outcome to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EXANDIS was formulated with the principle of raising the level of our nation's&mdash;and, in particular, our agricultural sector's&mdash;preparedness for the outbreak of exotic diseases. The Australian Animal Health Council, as a non&hyphen;profit company limited by guarantee, importantly has a wider focus, jointly funded by the Commonwealth, the states and the peak national representative bodies of Australian livestock based industries. Minister John Anderson made this statement to the House on 9 May 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The council's mission will be to ensure the Australian animal health services system is capable of maintaining acceptable national animal health standards which meet consumer needs and market requirements at home and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>Awakening industry, all the way to the consumers themselves, and preparing it for the great threat of highly contagious exotic disease is but one matter. Allowing, without categorical evidence to the contrary, a window of opportunity to exotic disease to enter is something that does greatly concern industry and, I am sure, every member in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EXANDIS pulled no punches in its summary of its operations in its final published report. In particular, page 12 of that report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greatest threat to Australia is considered to be the highly contagious foot&hyphen;and&hyphen;mouth disease. An outbreak of FMD would have a devastating effect on the meat and meat product industries. Other serious threats are Newcastle Disease, blue&hyphen;tongue and classic swine fever. An outbreak of any of these diseases would incur heavy control, compensation and trade costs.</PARA>
<PARA>Speaking out for the local chicken growers, beef producers and farming families of Paterson, I have taken a perfectly solid stance, one that I am comfortable with, that an open door policy to disease is not my policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this makes the success of the AAHC critical. Disease knows nothing of state or territory boundaries, let alone electorates or shires. Just as strategic direction in thinking is needed to avert the introduction of exotic diseases, by applying a strategic direction to the animal health service industry by utilising both private and public sector resources for the public good and by putting the structure in place for the AAHC to effectively operate, one must not let slide through to the keeper the critical role of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The blowtorch has certainly been put to the belly of AQIS in recent times and, like all regionally based members, I will be looking on the imminent release of the Nairn committee of inquiry report into its operations with a great deal of interest.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4101">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just a matter of weeks ago, at the first public hearing of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, whose terms of reference apply to the suggested acceptability of importing cooked chicken meat to Australia, Paul Hickey, the Executive Director of AQIS, again found that the organisation which he heads was before the parliamentarians with lots of questions. AQIS, of course, has undertaken full quarantine risk assessments of the very issue of cooked chicken imports arriving on our shores: a notion which I dispute and will take umbrage at on Friday of this week at the committee hearing in my electorate in Maitland.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hickey said to the committee&mdash;and I do not dispute the point&mdash;that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are obligations that Australia and AQIS have in relation to the quarantine aspects of this (the importation of cooked chicken) and all other access issues. These obligations arise from Commonwealth legislation and Australia's commitment to the sanitary and phytosanitary agreement of the World Trade Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, our quarantine decisions must have a sound scientific and technical base. Second, our quarantine decisions must flow from a proper process of risk assessment. Third, AQIS must adopt a consistent approach to risk management&mdash;that being to adjust the acceptable risk from case to case. Fourth, access decisions must be designed to achieve the determined acceptable level of risk in the least trade restrictive way. Fifth, AQIS's decision making processes must be transparent and open, as a large net exporter of agricultural products.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>What I do dispute, in line with what the AAHC is attempting to achieve, is AQIS's perception of risk management&mdash;to what level, to what stakes, it is willing to raise the game of risk of inadvertent green light policy to exotic diseases. The `no level of risk' as being the acceptable line has been disputed publicly as an impossible and intractable position to take by none other than the head of AQIS himself. I find the assessment, by the nation's official doorman to stop the possible exotic disease entry, somewhat confusing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An assessment of the economic fallout from the virulent newcastle disease, done by none other than ABARE and using the Hunter and Western Sydney as models, found with imports of cooked chicken a decline of upwards of $37 million to the industry in the first year alone, that on the back of 40,000 tonnes of imports there was a loss to producers of $93 million and that on the back of 100,000 tonnes a staggering $169 million was lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sense and sensibility of the situation&mdash;to use a turn of phrase from a recent movie&mdash;would be to get it right in the first place. So the AAHC should do its job, as this legislation allows it to do, and set about doing a better job more efficiently and with better resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there are a lot of questions relating to AQIS's role, its accountability and its accessibility which have been raised and which need to be answered. That is something that I will continue to pursue in the Main Committee and, indeed, in the Senate inquiry on Friday.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, the opposition is happy to see the Australian Animal Health Council (Live&hyphen;stock Industries) Funding Bill passed. In fact, most of the ideas and the content behind it were developed by the former Labor government. The approach that derives from it comes from our thinking, so it would be hardly likely that we would oppose it in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like to pick up on some of the comments from the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin). I think it is quite evident that there is a very real awareness in Australia, that a spark has been lit, about the opportunity of getting clean, fresh food, particularly meat products, from the various industries that have export markets not just in Asia <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4102"> but also in some of our more traditional trading partners. Some of these markets have tended to have had less attention in recent years for a whole lot of reasons, but our attention should now be sparked up again&mdash;Canada is one country that I might mention. This is not just about maintaining acceptable animal health standards for consumer needs and market requirements for exports; it is also for our domestic consumer market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the dynamics that is operating in Australia at the moment is the incredible surge in tourism that has taken place over the last 12 or 13 years, which brought many visitors. Those visitors inevitably return and when we go to their countries and speak with their senior ministers we find them constantly observing that their visitors to Australia continually remark on the clean, fresh air&mdash;pollution is an issue; they notice that there can be a difference&mdash;and on the quality and price of food in Australia compared with so many other countries around the world. So in our own markets it is important that we continue to develop this notion of presenting a wide range of very high quality foods for our restaurants, for our own homes and, of course, for export&mdash;not just for our own health and well being.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These levies, which are provided for under the various bills that are being debated cognately, play their role in enabling the Australian Animal Health Council to play its role in ensuring that all this comes together and maintains the standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own territory down in central Victoria, north of Tullamarine airport, probably the largest employer in the public sector in the region is meat processing. None of it is exported. Maybe there are some things to be done there to drive that further. We have had a very unfortunate experience of shonky operators causing works to be closed for quite a long time but they have now been reopened under much higher quality regimes and we are seeing a focus on the opportunities that are developing under this whole policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I heard the honourable member mention, transport is one of the issues that we have to focus on. One of the sleepers for the industry is the question of packaging and the dynamics of new high&hyphen;tech packaging that will change the whole structure of transport. Just about anywhere you go in Australia, people are demanding an extension to their airport's runway so that they can land jets and have fresh food airfreighted straight into their markets, wherever they may be. I would postulate in this parliament that as we are building those runways, as we are building those cool stores, other parts of the industry are in fact developing very high&hyphen;tech long&hyphen;life fresh packaging which enables us to put that food, supermarket ready, into chilled containers that will go by land and sea bridge and arrive after anything up to 20 or 30 days in the transport cycle, ready for consumption, as if they had been picked or packed or processed just yesterday. So that is one of the things that will determine investment in these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member did mention the salmon industry. It is not directly related to the levies covered under this bill but I have to say that in my parliamentary role I had the great pleasure of visiting Nortas, a salmon processing operation in Mornington in Hobart, with the member for the area, the member for Franklin (Mr Quick). He is in the chamber today. I do compliment him on his approach to these businesses in his region. A day on the hustings with Harry and you come back with knowledge that is just astounding of the things that are going on and the foresight that is being shown down in Tasmania. I commend the member for Franklin for his efforts in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key points that came through out of that visit to Nortas was a very deep concern in the salmon processing industry about the prospect of imports, particularly from Canada, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4103"> being allowed by the government. In our time in government we did not accede to this request. We had it under review and we were genuinely leaning to the view that there was a risk of contaminated product arriving in Australia and of that product putting at risk our own industries. I think we have all been around this circle many times and we all well understand that, any time there is a question of competition from imports, one of the views the particular industry immediately puts on the table is that Australia has the highest standards in the world and we do not want to put them at risk from imports. And so we have actually had to become expert about assessing what is a real risk and what is simply a barrier against imports and competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that in the case of the fresh salmon industry the evidence is incontestable that overseas fresh salmon have a wide variety of diseases which may be quite acceptable and containable in their own environment but which are a major risk in our territory. We are learning, through the ballast water used in shipping, something we were completely unaware of until we started to observe it: that organisms coming from foreign waters bloom in Australian waters and create a risk to this kind of production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having started as a geographically isolated place, Australia is now more and more exposed to an international trading economy. We have to be genuinely careful about these sorts of issues, where they are a real risk and where they are perhaps a defence against competition from imports. It is important for our people to know that Nortas is concerned about competition from imports which may cause this problem. At the moment, we are cranking up a packaging, export and promotion campaign to build up the industry and to export from it. We have to understand that it cannot be competition from imports for the sake of it because we are in fact wanting these very countries to accept our products. Where we have a risk to our clean fresh food image that has to be seriously evaluated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the minister to take very seriously the representations from the industry. I certainly made the public pronouncement when I was in the region with Mr Quick that I would be recommending to our shadow spokesman in this field, Senator Collins, that we accept the veracity of the arguments and press the minister to place barriers against this imported fresh salmon product. I just used Nortas by way of example. I think we all understand the dynamics of competition and imports and exports. We all understand the dynamics of opening markets for ourselves and having to, on the other hand, open markets for others into Australia. That is the consequence of becoming an internationalised trading economy, which we are all very keen to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know we have a spectacular product. We know we have the skills to develop it, market it and export it. We have to be very sure that, whether it is meat, fish or whatever, free exchange does not place at risk, in any way, the standard of our animals or our product. This legislation is designed to ensure that the Australian Animal Health Council plays that role. The principles behind it are supported by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I threw in the example of Nortas in Tasmania by way of illustration that it is not just about meat products; it is also about a wide range of food products that Australian industry is becoming quite dynamic in in international terms and there is the need to provide it with that consideration. With those comments, I indicate that the opposition is quite happy to support this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation is, in itself, attracting no criticism but it does, as the previous speaker has indicated, raise a lot of issues related to animal health <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4104"> and the means by which we protect the animals resident in Australia&mdash;be they fish, fowl or otherwise. It also raises aspects of the means by which we conduct our quarantine and export inspection services. All of these issues are ones of grave concern to me, representing probably the last remaining purely agricultural electorate in Australia. Certainly, it is the only electorate where the numbers of people directly associated with agriculture outnumber other groups in the electorate. This is a matter of grave importance to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an amazing situation throughout the small business arena today how certain costs, particularly those related to government activity, continue to rise. Of course, the market is not giving a similar rise in returns to agricultural producers or, for that matter, other small business producers. An example I looked at the other day shows that the sorts of rents that motel operators can attract in this day and age have not changed much in the last 10 years. I noted that, on a particular family property of that nature, in that same period, local government rates had doubled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are sections of the community that can charge any price they like by purely sending a letter in the mail and there are other sections, those dealing directly with the public or, in the case of agriculture, with importing countries, that do not have such an entitlement. In fact, the market prevails and, as I have said in this place before, there are just three questions: how good, how soon and how much? If you cannot meet all three of those criteria, they go elsewhere. So these are the issues that relate to these sorts of measures, because this is a measure to increase the amount of levy charged on a variety of producers&mdash;cattle, chickens and other sorts of livestock&mdash;to additionally fund the Australian Animal Health Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that the quota industry is highly supportive of this proposal. That is another matter of grave concern to me because too often politicians classify `industry'&mdash;if I can use that in inverted commas&mdash;as a group of people in some commodity council, such as the Wool Council or the Grains Council or the AMLC or someone like this, when, in fact, in recent times, particularly in wool, they have demonstrated how distant they are from the grassroots of the organisation or the industry they choose to represent. I think it is time that we politicians make sure that when we bring these matters before the parliament and claim that they have `industry support' we recognise the industry as the people who actually write the cheques, not the half a dozen who get paid a fee to attend some commodity council meeting and commit their members to all sorts of costs which they have never been consulted about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like specifically to take this opportunity to talk about the aspects of the costs that emanate from organisations of this nature, which we are funding today. I particularly want to look at AQIS and the fees and basis of its operation. It is no coincidence that in recent times I have had representations&mdash;and I could do without telephone calls being made at that level, thanks very much, Whip. Can you take that phone call somewhere else, Mark? I find this outrageous.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming back to the address I want to make, which is pretty important, in recent times three issues have been drawn to my attention. The first relates to circumstances where an elector in my electorate chose to spend over $1 million building an export abattoir. He did so as an investment and by prearrangement some people had rented it from him to conduct the business. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4105"> Apparently, these people were undercapitalised and within a reasonably short period&mdash;some months&mdash;were unable to continue the business. He had to take steps to have them evicted from the premises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That sounds a pretty simple story, but there was one problem&mdash;at the end of that period they owed inspection fees of some $50,000, which AQIS attributes to the premises. This fellow wanted to either take the business over himself or install a new tenant and AQIS told him he could not do so until he paid the debts of his previous tenant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I approached the minister on this he said, `Oh well, that is what the industry wants.' I find that outrageous. My minister said, `That is what the industry wants.' We have a perfectly good facility, which would add competition to the marketplace in terms of buying livestock and processing it, all held up because AQIS finds it more convenient to collect its debts by this process, instead of having a proper process in place, whereby it deals with the person it licences and, if it has concerns about their financial capacity, it requires bonds or the like to be made available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the minister to put the necessary administrative processes in place to ensure that somebody who has invested in the industry and is creating the opportunity for jobs and everything else is not loaded up with the debts of someone totally outside their control. It is ridiculous, and it is the first example of what is wrong with the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second one relates to fee structures. I have a constituent who has done almost the impossible. A relatively small pig producer, selling about a thousand pigs a year, running them open&hyphen;range and chemical free, he had the initiative to pack himself up, pay for a stand in a major food fair in Japan, take his little video over there and make some market contacts, which has resulted in a very important and high&hyphen;yielding niche market. He literally airfreights pig carcases to Japan at a profit. In fact, he has found it the mainstay of his business in the downturn that has occurred here in the pig industry in Australia. I want to come back to some of the reasons for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, because the product is pork, he is not able to meet his Japanese buyer's demand to provide the buyer with a boned product. The reality is that, within Western Australia&mdash;and I would not be surprised if it occurred in other states&mdash;you cannot get any licensed export boning works to bone pork, because their principal business is mutton going into halal markets. Of course, to allow one hair of a pig inside those establishments would see them deemed off&hyphen;limits for future halal boning of mutton. He has managed to get them slaughtered, because that can be done in another works that deals with pigs on the domestic market. That is okay, but he cannot get them boned out by an export works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer is, as I mentioned in the beginning, that he actually flies them out in carcase form. His buyer has to pay airfreight on all the bones, and he does not even want the skin on the product, in fact. Over there, apparently, that is the way they want it. So he has got to find a solution to this, and the only solution available is to have his own little boning works. Ideally, that should be built on his own property as a small slaughterhouse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the size of the operation, that is not a problem. The licensing requirements are all about cleanliness and the make&hyphen;up of the facility. So, capital&hyphen;wise, that is not a problem. I must also say, in mentioning this, that the staff of AQIS with whom I have been dealing on this matter have been most cooperative. But, when I go to them to try and find out how they will be involved, they give me a sheet of paper that points out that to licence his works&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4106"> which would be smaller than this room&mdash;the annual fee is $30,350. That is the fee. You can kill 10,000 pigs or you can kill 10 pigs, for the same price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is ridiculous. It is evidence of the lack of flexibility. We have got a bloke who has established his own market. We did not help him, Austrade did not help him, no&hyphen;one helped him; he has done it all himself. Now, at a time when he desperately needs this commodity, we are unable to say to him, `Well, that's the way it should go.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take that a step further. In terms of inspection, whilst AQIS are quite willing to licence the local vet, they still become the charging agent. They do not licence the vet and then let people deal with the vet in terms of fees, arrangements for visits and all that sort of thing. That vet has got to go and do four weeks study with AQIS and then come down as an employee or a subcontractor of AQIS. The going rate then is something like $65 an hour. It seems that there are other problems associated with that. It makes it totally uneconomical, and we have got to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot see why we cannot progress to a situation where AQIS is the provider of the regulatory program and the inspector of those people they license. When we look to the aircraft industry where Qantas is the only airline in the world to have achieved two world safest airline awards, we see that its planes are not inspected by government employees. The licensed aircraft maintenance engineer&mdash;the LAME&mdash;is an employee of Qantas, licensed by the government. Whilst someone might point to the general aviation industry where we had some problems with aircraft maintenance recently, the interesting point was that it was not the licensed aircraft maintenance engineers at fault. They were telling the people who license them&mdash;I call them the CAA, but they have had a number of names&mdash;that the actual neglect was in the licensing authority, so the system had worked. People are licensed and they act as both subcontractors and employees to guarantee the safety of those aircraft. As I once said when the royal commission was looking into meat inspection and substitution some years ago, if I had the choice between having an aircraft stop at 40,000 feet and a tummy ache, I know which one I would prefer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that you can have an inspection system where government oversees it and the private sector pays the wages or it contracts out. I think it is time that AQIS went down that road and had as its employees just the upper echelon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take this a step further because the same issue applies with the export of wildflowers from my electorate&mdash;another great market, quite significant, all airfreight. I might add that it is a battle from Western Australia to get that space at very high rates. But why add to the problem by government inspection? We do not have a requirement for these things to be inspected on export but if you are going into the Japanese market, the Japanese will require it, so you need a certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an interesting thing that quite properly AQIS has subcontracted the Western Australian Department of Agriculture to undertake this work on its behalf. If you were to export flowers, say, from Canberra to Perth they have to be inspected by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture and the fee is $25. The problem arises if you go along to that same inspector and ask him to certify flowers that you are exporting overseas on behalf of AQIS. The fee is $86 and double on weekends, by the same person. The state government can do the job for $25 but when AQIS hires the inspector the fee is $86.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other complications&mdash;which I will not go into now&mdash;when you try to get this service provided. It sort of doubles up. You can take a room full of flowers down to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4107"> inspected but if the airline says it will take only half today and the other half tomorrow you have to pay twice. We really have to look at this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the previous speaker mentioned, there is this grave concern we have with quarantine services at the other end of the proposal. Recently, a substantial import of canola seed was approved to Australia from New Zealand. It arrived substantially contaminated with a variety of weeds not existing at present in Australia&mdash;certainly not in Western Australia. The member for Murray (Mrs Stone) has just informed me that her electorate has a similar problem. The seeds got past the inspection authorities. There was apparently no growing out process to test what would come up when you put the seeds in the ground. Growers have bought this seed&mdash;it is apparently a superior variety of canola&mdash;planted it and gone back into their paddocks to find that they are half&hyphen;full of weeds that we have never seen before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One might just wonder what we have the service for and how we can say, as we are saying with chicken meat and with fresh salmon imports, that we have an adequate service to guarantee that the diseases that are associated with the countries of origin in these two areas would not be imported into Australia. We know the sorts of results that can occur within my electorate at the moment and they are still trying to track it down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing lupin paddocks decimated in the Mullewa region at this moment by a new fungus which has the opening word of `anthrax' in it. It is obviously not animal anthrax, but it is an anthrax type of fungus that is having, as the first person who rang me about it said, the same effect as spraying the lupins with 2&hyphen;4D. This fellow went into his paddock and thought that that was what must have happened. It just wiped the lupins out. It is very serious. It is his view that the original disease arrived in that district some time in 1963 with an uninspected importation of albus lupin seed. The outbreak was apparently dealt with at the time, but it has resurfaced 33 years later. It just gives you some indication of how careful we have to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put this in another context in regard to pork. The pork industry in Australia is in severe financial difficulty, firstly, because of increased grain prices and, secondly, because of the competition being provided by subsidised pork coming out of Canada. It is fresh pork from a country where there are known diseases not known in Australia. At the time, many of us argued that this was sufficient reason to keep it out. The argument countering that was that there really was not sufficient risk and the Canadians were threatening to cut back on their Australian beef imports if we did not do something about it. So we granted the import of this pork. This has had a financial effect on the local industry and, as I recollect, the Canadians then cut the quota of Australian beef going into Canada&mdash;really matey. It proves the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our problem is that we cannot, of course, go back on a scientific decision. You can change the tariffs and things like that, but once you have said that there is no risk in the importation of something and your science has proved it, you cannot go back next week and say, `We have rethought the situation and we think the risk is too great.' You are too late, and the Canadians know that. We get this sort of treatment all the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My pig exporter to Japan told me that the other day the Japanese just happened to put the import duty on his pork up to 40 per cent. There was no reason given other than that he was getting markets. Of course, at the moment, because of the silly arrangements we have here in Australia, he has to pay 40 per cent on the bones. We really do have to think about the way we manage these things if our country is to be competitive around the world. We have to make sure we protect the cleanliness of our livestock and the things that mean so much to us.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4108">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a disease in grain in America&mdash;karmel bunc. I call it the foot&hyphen;and&hyphen;mouth disease of the wheat industry. Fortunately, at this stage of the game, our import restrictions are very strong in that regard. But it is double&hyphen;sided. How do we best ensure the competitiveness of our exporters? How do we best use the system to guarantee that there is no risk to our product?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker talked about salmon, and he has my full endorsement. Years ago, I tried to assist my crayfish industry people by the importation of salmon heads. I became horrified by the types of diseases that could be introduced to Australian waters by allowing that to happen. In fact, to their credit, the authorities stuck out and demanded that only after irradiation could those salmon heads be brought in here as crayfish bait. I have to concur with the evidence that was eventually provided to me that that was worthwhile.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable members question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Assistant Treasurer has indicated that Mr Pyne has provided further information to clarify the information sought in question (1) and this response addresses question (1) as clarified ie information relates to 1994/95 income tax returns lodged in the 1995/96 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) In the 1994/95 financial year the CSA identified 58 cases where it failed to intercept tax refunds, due to human or clerical error, which should have been intercepted (via the Tax Refund Intercept Program&mdash;TRIPS) to offset child support debts. In the 1995/96 financial year the CSA identified 76 cases where it failed to intercept tax refunds due to human or clerical error. In addition, a computer system error during the period 2 November 1995 to 17 November 1995 resulted in 3,546 income tax refunds issuing to payers which should have been identified and considered for interception. Generally, payees are not advised that they will receive payments in arrears through the interception measure. It would be normal to advise the payee in general terms that the CSA would intercept a refund if one became available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Although the CSA cannot provide the precise information requested it has identified that the financial loss incurred by custodial parents where the CSA failed to intercept tax refunds was $71 701 in 1994/95 and $141 053.03 in 1995/96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The non&hyphen;interception of refunds in November 1995 occurred as a result of a National Taxpayer System (NTS) program error. Branch offices in the agency were asked to take all possible action to recover the amount of the refund. Depending on the circumstances, action included cancelling cheques before they issued, placing a stopper on cheques, contacting the payer to arrange for the amount to be paid to the Agency and issuing a notice to banks requiring the bank to pay the amount of the child support liability to the Agency. New procedures have been put in place to ensure the same type of error does not occur again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the staff instruction manual for the Tax Refund Interception Program (TRIPS) has been rewritten and issued to CSA client contact officers.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr Anderson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes, I am aware of a range of different devices that are designed to exclude turtles from the nets of trawlers. Several of these turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) have been trialled to investigate the potential for their application in Australian fisheries. Devices that have been trialled include the Morrison soft TED and the Supershooter grid. Both of these TEDs are used in the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery. A Norwegian TED, the Nordmore grid, has also been trialled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has not evaluated these TEDs. That function has been carried out principally by State agencies and the CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trials of TEDs were conducted in a joint project by the CSIRO Division of Fisheries, Australian Maritime College (AMC) and the Northern Territory Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (NTDPIF) in February and March 1995. Several of the most promising TEDs were tested in the Gulf of Carpentaria to determine their effectiveness and suitability for Australian conditions. The results of these trials demonstrated that some TEDs were quite successful at substantially reducing the by&hyphen;catch of turtles and other large animals. However, the use of TEDs also reduced the catch of prawns. The project has now moved on to commercial trials of these devices through a joint project with the Queensland Department of Primary Industries (QDPI), AMC and the CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional trials of TEDs such as the Morrison soft TED and the Nordmore grid and other types of by&hyphen;catch reduction devices (BRDs) have been conducted by NSW Fisheries, QDPI, and NTDPIF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The QDPI and the NTDPIF are jointly developing a TED designed specifically for Australian <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4113"> conditions, the AusTED. This project has been funded through the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC). The final report on the project is due in December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(b) My Department has not yet recommended that trawlers fit turtle exclusion devices for two reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) Existing TEDs have been designed overseas to suit local conditions. Australian fisheries and fishing methods are different to those in other countries. Refinements of these devices are required to minimise the loss of prawns associated with their use and to make them suitable for Australian conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) Mandating the use of turtle exclusion devices could be counter productive and such action caused considerable conflict in the US fisheries. Without the cooperation of the fishing industry the cost of surveillance and enforcement of TEDs would be prohibitively high. This Government prefers to work in a cooperative manner with industry, environmental groups and State Governments. This approach allows us to catch our fisheries resources and protect our wildlife at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such an approach has been used successfully in the NSW prawn trawl fisheries. Approximately 30% of the NSW offshore prawn trawl fishery use TEDs or other forms of BRDs on a voluntary basis. At times the majority of estuarine prawn trawlers in NSW use some form of TED or BRD such as the Nordmore grid on a voluntary basis to exclude jellyfish and other by&hyphen;catch species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A $2 million program to encourage the voluntary use of by&hyphen;catch reduction devices (BRDs) including TEDs commenced in July 1996. The program incorporates a `gear library' of BRDs that the fishing industry may borrow to trial. The gear library will include the AusTED and a range of overseas TED designs that were trialled and refined in the Gulf of Carpentaria study. The gear library will allow these devices to be trialled under commercial fishing conditions and their performance will be documented by a research observer. The program will also include workshops held at different ports, and a range of educational materials such as videos and newsletters to carry the message. It will be available to trawlers in the Queensland east coast otter trawl fishery, the northern prawn fishery and the Torres Strait. The program is run jointly by the QDPI, AMC and the CSIRO. It is funded by the FRDC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) I am advised that studies estimated the number of turtles captured by trawlers in the northern prawn fishery to be 5503 (424) in 1989 and 5238 (404) in 1990. Turtle captures in the northern prawn fishery and Torres Strait are dominated by flatback (59%), olive ridley (12%) and loggerhead turtles (10%). <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Captures from the Queensland east coast otter trawl fishery were estimated at 5295 (1231) turtles annually between 1991 and 1992. The main species taken in the Queensland east coast trawl fishery are the loggerhead (50.4%), green (30.1%) and flatback turtles (10.1%).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of these turtles approximately 750 in the northern prawn fishery and 50 in the Queensland east coast fishery were dead when brought aboard trawlers in 1990 and 1991. Some turtles were also comatose when brought aboard. Comatose turtles are allowed to recover on the deck for a period before being released. Subsequent mortality is unknown. However, if a worst case scenario is assumed in which all comatose turtles die, then a maximum of around 2,500 turtles of five species were killed annually in 1990 and 1991 by the use of trawls in northern Australia. A subsequent reduction of the fishing effort in the northern prawn fishery would have decreased the number of turtle deaths there by an estimated 30% since 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In contrast, the indigenous harvest of green turtles in Torres Strait and southern Papua New Guinea has been estimated at 5,200 to 6,300 turtles per year. The annual catch of the Indonesian commercial fishery is estimated to be in excess of 70,000 green and hawksbill turtles per year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government determined, as part of the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget, that the Textile Clothing and Footwear Labour Adjustment Package (TCF LAP) would cease on 31 August 1996.</PARA>
<PARA><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4114"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This decision means that from 1 September 1996 the Commonwealth Employment Service is not able to approve further training courses, wage subsidies or relocation assistance under the TCF LAP.

All forms of assistance under TCF LAP will cease from 31 December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government had to consider very carefully the different forms of assistance available to unemployed workers and to rationalise and optimise those various arrangements.
