If now is not the time, I hope you will make a statement at 2 o'clock before question time. It seems to me, as yesterday when you made a similar statement, that it is essential people realise that our whole democratic process is at threat when people behave as they did yesterday and as they did on Monday.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst the terms of the motion were clear enough on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> , I was hoping that the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), might have gone just a little further&mdash;this being a suitable occasion to look at parliamentary sittings for the rest of the year. We are scheduled to sit, as I understand it, for a further 30 days, including two days this week in which debate will be curtailed because of the presentations of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in connection with the budget. The adjournment debate will not be brought on and that is standard practice. On 30 April this year the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a role in the national parliament for proper and full expressions of view from both sides of politics. I will . . . extend proper courtesies to . . . all members of the opposition and to the independent members . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The government has also kindly provided a draft business program to all honourable members. Only a cursory glance at that would tell anyone in this place that the government cannot possibly meet its program without curtailing future debate. The draft program I am talking about does not include budget related bills. Excluding those, the government will not be able to get through its program, given 30 sitting days. It is as plain as the nose on my face. It does not sit too well with other comments of the Prime Minister, such as the statement he made on 10 February 1994 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have long held the view that this parliament should sit more frequently . . . if we sat closer to 100 days a year . . . I have always thought that the Christmas recess was a bit too long.</PARA>
<PARA>He said earlier in October 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no reason why the fewer than 100 days a year that parliament sits . . . should not be increased by 30 to 50% . . . None of us have a greater duty than to sit here representing the people who sent us . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I think I heard those remarks and I probably enjoined those sentiments that he expressed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> then by saying, `Hear, hear!' This year the parliament will have sat a total of 53 days on the present arrangements. Even allowing for the fact that there has been an election earlier this year, if you extended the normal sitting pattern that the government is presently observing over the election period, we would only get up to around 70-odd sitting days at the very best. We have 30 sitting days in this budget session&mdash;30 by two is 60 days. That is a long way short of the 100 days of which the Prime Minister spoke and I have referred to already.</PARA>

<PARA>He has also said since the election:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a role in the national parliament for proper and full expressions of view from both sides of politics.</PARA>
<PARA>You are not going to get that if you curtail these sittings. You know darn well you are going to have to apply the gag and the guillotine to get through your program. Why don't you be up&hyphen;front now and say exactly what you are going to do? Even better, why don't you schedule in two or three more sitting weeks? That is what the parliament is for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have come here, as the Prime Minister said, to observe the very noble sentiment he expressed in October 1993: that none of us have a greater duty than to sit here representing the people who sent us here. The Leader of the House, the member for Flinders, knows very well that, without the application of the gag and the guillotine, we cannot get through the scheduled business. I regret the fact most sincerely that the Leader of the House has not taken this opportunity or another one in the first week of the sitting of this budget session to schedule in adequate sitting times so that members may perform the duties they were elected to do: to represent their views as they see reasonably fit in this the major forum for the Australian people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously the opposition supports this motion. I think the arrangements made for tomorrow are reasonable. I just want to make a few brief remarks about the points raised by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). It is true that the expressed attitude of the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the parliament on the proper procedures of parliament that he outlined before the election now means we have another broken promise. Now he is in government he is clearly committed to the supremacy of the executive over parliament. He is substantially ignoring the parliament in breach of the views he outlined both as Leader of the Opposition and in earlier periods as a senior member of the opposition during the period leading up to the 1996 election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not suppose that on this day after the budget of broken promises anyone should be surprised, but it is true and it is a cause for continuing concern to many members of parliament and consistently, I know, to the member for Curtin and some of his colleagues. The opposition supports the motion and considers it a reasonable arrangement for tomorrow. I know my colleague the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) will have some things to say about the overall arrangements, but let us make our judgment about whether those promises about the attitude towards parliament are kept during 1997 as we see how the arrangements for parliament for which this government is responsible unfold in a full year. I am extremely dubious that the commitments they made before the election will be kept, but let us reserve our judgment just a little more.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I did not speak when I first moved the motion simply because the intent of this motion is very clear&mdash;it is narrowed to the circumstances this week. It is the practice of this House to make certain arrangements for the delivery of the budget and for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to have the same right of reply. That is not curtailing debate, as the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) says. In fact, I think it is rather an important debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You said it was curtailing debate. I personally think it is rather an important debate. We should have the second reading speech on the appropriation bill and we should also have the Leader of the Opposition's reply. That is debate. It is neither fair nor reasonable to assert that this is curtailing debate. It is the absolute standard arrangement about which, I must say, I do not believe the member for Curtin has complained in the past. I do not think he can reasonably complain about what we are doing this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not address the broader issues as he invited me to do because, basically, they are beyond the motion in front of the House. I think it is important that we try to keep remarks relevant to the issue before the House. I am more than happy to speak to the member for Curtin about the program for the balance of this year and for next year if he genuinely wants to discuss the matter with me, but so far he has not bothered to approach me about that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are sitting more days this year&mdash;an election year&mdash;than we did in 1993. It is quite unreasonable to make comparisons of the sitting days in an election year and those of an ordinary year. Obviously an election year disrupts the ordinary pattern of the sittings and we have had to take that into account in the usual way this election year. We have, however, consistent with our guarantee to attempt to provide people with more speaking opportunities, extended the sitting hours. We have also encouraged the use of the Main Committee. The member for Curtin also has a responsibility for the proper management of the Main Committee. It is not reasonable to be threatening the procedures in the Main Committee so as to shut it down. The Main Committee is an important forum for people to have an opportunity to speak&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Debate resumed from 20 August, on motion by <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Williams</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) in his second <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reading speech to the National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1996 said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All governments in this country are agreed that possession of firearms is not a right but a conditional privilege.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something I wholeheartedly endorse and agree with, and so does the opposition. This bill is a simple bill. In his second reading speech, the Attorney&hyphen;General states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill allows me to authorise payments by way of financial assistance to the states and territories for the purpose of providing compensation to firearms owners and dealers. It also allows me to authorise payments to the states and territories and by the Commonwealth for purposes directly connected to the compensation scheme and for implementation of the new nationwide licensing and registration schemes. The bill appropriates moneys from the consolidated revenue fund for these purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payments for reimbursement of compensation paid for surrendered firearms are limited to those surrendered during the national amnesty period of 10 May this year to 30 September next year, or such shorter period as I determine if any jurisdiction decides on a shorter amnesty. Gun dealers will also be able to claim for loss of business associated with surrender of stock and the Commonwealth will reimburse the states and territories for compensation paid in relation to such claims if the claim is lodged during the national amnesty period.</PARA>
<PARA>Those were the words of the Attorney-General in his second reading speech. The opposition wholeheartedly supports that. The Attorney&hyphen;General also said this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Swift action is essential if we are to have really effective nationwide firearms laws.</PARA>
<PARA>The opposition also supports that view. The Attorney&hyphen;General also graciously said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have had the support of the opposition right from the beginning for the new nationwide firearms laws and it has been invaluable in achieving community consensus. I ask the opposition to continue that support and pass this bill quickly.</PARA>
<PARA>I can give the Attorney-General and the government our assurance that they do have our support to pass this bill quickly. I understand there are some minor reservations that the shadow Attorney-General and minister for justice, Senator Bolkus, will attempt to discuss with the Attorney-General in the next day or two when the matter reaches the Senate. I am sure that if there are any legitimate concerns they will be considered.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3332">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, with that qualification, the opposition does support this bill and its expedited passage. Again, I say that I think this is an issue that is above party politics. I think this is an issue that, in the main, has achieved broad community support and broad political support. The community is the better for it, and the nation is the better for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that we do have some dissidents, and they are entitled to their view. You are never going to have a unanimous view in this society. But I would have thought there are very few bills like this that would have had the level of support on an issue such as this in the community. I again commend the Attorney-General for the way he has handled this matter since its inception. He does his office proud.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (O'Connor)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.50 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commence by saying that I am a person who licensed a rifle in Western Australia when I was 16. Even at that stage, I saw the weapon registered as part of my licensing requirement. I lived in the north-west and owned quite a variety of guns. In fact, in my early years in the hotel industry, I was the owner of a licensed hand gun. It is an interesting aspect of life that in those days you were entitled to license a hand gun for personal protection or the protection of cash. I used to have to transport cash from my hotel into the city each weekend night. My chances of being robbed in those days were significantly fewer than they would be today when, of course, it is considered highly inappropriate to have a hand gun for the protection of yourself or your property.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess that is just a commentary on the times, but I make the point that during that period I became the licensed owner of a number of firearms. Upon moving to Perth from the north-west, I surrendered nearly all of them as I thought it inappropriate to have these sorts of guns in my possession when I had obviously little use for them and they represented the problem of being stolen by someone who had the wrong intentions for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I am not somebody who is some sort of raving redneck when it comes to guns. In fact, it was interesting when I decided to hand in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the hand gun. I was immediately rushed by a large number of policemen who wanted it as a collector's item and that is, I think, where it stays today. But the reality is that I have always taken a practical view on gun ownership. Guns are things that should be owned for a proper purpose. I still retain the rifle that I bought when I was 16. I seldom use that rifle, yet I own a farming property where it might be of some use from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the banning of guns that are designed purely for military purposes. One of the reasons comes back to my practical views. Having won the rifle shooting in the national service with the old .303, I always found the modern weapon particularly inaccurate for the purposes for which it would be used in sport or feral animal control. The reality is that they all have a barrel about so long, and they have this massive fire power to make up for their accuracy. They are not appropriate for anything other than killing other people at close range. I am astounded that over the years federal governments of various persuasions have even allowed their importation. Why state governments considered they should be sold is beyond my understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rifles usually have a significantly longer barrel than some of the multi&hyphen;fire so-called sporting weapons&mdash;to give them the sort of accuracy needed when shooting feral or other animals at a distance. Such weapons are consequently very difficult to conceal. In the Port Arthur situation, for instance, the alleged killer was able to put his weapon in a sports bag. These are the circumstances of these sorts of weapons. There is a difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People should always have a need before the weapons are licensed. The Western Australian requirements that have existed as long as I can remember, which relate to the registration of both the gun and the person, are entirely appropriate and should be the national standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this huge amount of money that we are getting ready to distribute under this legislation today is somehow aimed at gun control rather than gun legislation. I often remind people that gun control is 10 per cent legislation and 90 per cent administration. I should probably break administration into 45 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3333"> per cent administration&mdash;that is, the activities of the police and others&mdash;and 45 per cent compliance. We need community support, but not from the general public, who do not own guns. Whilst they have opinions and support this process, they are not relevant to the debate when it comes to gun control. In the current environment of unregistered gun ownership within some states in Australia, we are almost totally reliant on community support from gun owners and their willingness to comply with the law. I feel that the emotion of this debate has created a situation where that compliance will not be forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have legislators who were involved at the federal level and those who have actually legislated in the states, particularly those states where, unlike Western Australia, the police do not know whose door to knock on, although they know they have a large range of gun owners out there. All that those gun owners have to do is produce a single gun and say, `Yes, this is the gun for which I am licensed.' The fact that they might have a large number of other weapons somewhere else is not known to the police, to whom the legislation gives the right to search without warrant. I think this might be very interesting to other people who break the law in certain categories, large and small: they might be getting worried about this. Clearly, if the police now have a suspicion about other matters, it is pretty simple to think they have a suspicion about gun ownership or the retention of guns on a property. They would enter it for that purpose and might walk out with three little marijuana plants that were growing in the bathroom. The people who worry about those sorts of things can deal with it themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that unless there is a high level of willingness to comply with these new laws, the only other solution basically is the sledgehammer on the yale lock. How many Australians would think that that was appropriate in the circumstances? As I understand it, that is how the laws are being written in this new proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unwillingness of legislators to moderate their legislation in terms of the banning of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> certain guns has greatly undermined community support from gun owners and, consequently, reduced the potential for a high level of compliance. In particular, I wish to refer to the licensing of modified multi-shot weapons such as semiautomatic and pump action shotguns by the process of crimping, a word which is now part of our terminology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing about a gun that cannot be modified and remodified with reasonable equipment. As I reminded the Liberal party room, give me an old copy of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jane's</EMPHASIS> magazine and a reasonable machine workshop and I will make you an Owen gun over a weekend. The Owen gun was rejected by military forces after its invention because it was so simple. My recollection is that it had three or four moving parts. All that is required for an automatic weapon is a piston and a spring. The firing pin is in the piston, the firing of the first shot returns the piston against the spring and the spring then returns the piston against the next shot. Away it goes until it empties the magazine, which is a rather simple spring&hyphen;loaded box.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that a crimping process could not be tolerated on the grounds that it is reversible is a fallacious argument. Anything is reversible. The fact is that you can make a gun from scratch that would do all the damage that occurred at Port Arthur. That is not the issue. The issue for me came from my assessment within my own electorate and other parts of the country. Why would somebody who owns a gun that is presently not registered as a firearm, which is not on any government register or any piece of paper, go through the process&mdash;in this case it is a five&hyphen;shot magazine&mdash;of going to an armourer and paying them the money to have the weapon modified to have a magazine capacity of two shots? That is the equivalent of a double&hyphen;barrelled shotgun which, we are assured, is licensable&mdash;though not yet by nine&hyphen;year&hyphen;old or 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old potential olympians: that is another issue that I want to come back to. That double&hyphen;barrelled shotgun is licensable under fairly reasonable conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where somebody would go to an armourer, have a single&hyphen;barrel, semiautomatic shotgun modified down to a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3334"> two-shot capacity, take it along to the police, have it registered, let the world know they are the owner and then go back to the armourer. I doubt that they would get the armourer to remodify it, unless he was a crook, because that person is licensed and would be unlikely to want to participate in such an unlawful act or go through some process of reconverting that weapon to a five&hyphen;shot magazine capacity and returning it to an illegal status. Why would you do that when all you had to do was keep the gun at home in the first place and ignore the whole process?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to look at these things on the balance of probability. Persons who went through that process would have done it for the purpose of making the gun and themselves legal. The problem we now have is that all those people have only one solution: confiscation or voluntary handover. They cannot retain the ownership of that style of weapon, even if it is limited to two&hyphen;shot capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are reasons why people want these sorts of weapons, particularly women involved in the sport of clay target shooting which got a bit of prominence the other day because it was the first gold medal that Australia won when we were pretty well down in the dumps after we had not been as successful as we anticipated in the swimming pool. We were pretty lifted by young Michael Diamond's&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not Neil. I thought of that. Neil used to do a lot of this, didn't he? The reality is that when he brought great honour to Australia, everybody took a pretty fair interest. I have had people say to me, `So what is the difference? What is the difference between Michael Diamond's over&hyphen;and&hyphen;under double&hyphen;barrel shotgun and a semiautomatic? They both fire a cartridge. Surely the impact on the shoulder is the same?' Of course, it is not. It is substantially different. With any automatic weapon, between your shoulder and the point of explosion there is a big spring which is used for the reloading mechanism. That is what cushions the effect on a person's shoulder. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although Michael Diamond did not explain this to us on his numerous televisions appearances, I would not be surprised if that gun that he is using cost about $10,000. Any over&hyphen;and&hyphen;under shotgun is relatively expensive compared with a five&hyphen;shot Browning. Let's face it: not everybody who starts clay target shooting decides that they are going to be an Olympian overnight. It is pretty clear from the success rate of our people at the Olympics that you need to start at about eight or nine years of age to achieve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation that was recently passed in New South Wales and Victoria as yet makes no provision for anybody to be participating in that sport, or particularly national and state championships, at age nine and 14. I am wondering when the legislators will get round to it. Apparently they are talking about it. We are running around the countryside now trying to find 14&hyphen; and 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;old kids to compete as our representatives at the Sydney Olympics, but not with guns. That is a rather silly aspect of the emotional approach that is being taken, rather than a practical approach to achieve the maximum amount of compliance and a commonsense approach to multi&hyphen;shot weapons and some of these other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have asked my colleagues in Western Australia whether there is anything in this new legislation that substantially increases the penalties for breaking and entering to steal a gun or simply stealing one. I don't think so. Nobody has thought of that. Yet we understand that the tragic event that we have heard about may have been, in total, a problem of stolen weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the things I want to bring to the attention of the House. It is probably too late because we have had this mad emotional rush instead of looking very sensibly at good legislation for good purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also draw to the attention of the House my other area of concern. Nobody likes death by any means, and guns&mdash;primarily through the act of suicide&mdash;kill over 500 people a year. I think some 400&hyphen;odd such deaths are suicides. Suicide becomes the act through a gun because of its availability. We certainly do not propose to take every gun out of society. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3335">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think any assessment of the suicides would probably show that the guns used in those very unfortunate events would be guns that would remain licensed. The reality is that they are a very simple and available means of taking your own life and they will feature highly in the statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a motel and hotel proprietor, I unfortunately have had to attend a suicide by plastic bag. It is becoming more and more common. Those same plastic bags are the reason for the deaths of toddlers. We get to a situation where we might ask ourselves whether we should be banning plastic bags, and we obviously will not.</PARA>

That does not alter the fact that we should do everything in our power to make sure that those deaths are reduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make&mdash;and it is directly relevant to this legislation&mdash;is that we have decided to raise $500 million through the Medicare levy for the purpose of buying back some of these guns. I am very concerned, for instance, about certain guns which are now licensed and in people's hands. These people, though, are no longer going to be eligible to be licensed as they do not have an appropriate need. There is nothing in this legislation or the arrangements for compensation to compensate those people&mdash;only people who are handing in a gun that is no longer licensable. I draw the House's attention to the fact that that is another reason why certain people will not hand in their guns. That is not what we are about. We want to get these guns out of circulation if people do not have an appropriate need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Every day in Australia, more people die of heart failure and cancer than died in Tasmania on that day. When is this parliament going to decide that it can do something for those people who die day after day but who get no recognition in this place by way of appropri ate research funding? We should apply an appropriate practical and pragmatic formula for the Australians who die in their tens of thousands each year of heart failure and cancer. The reality is that because so many die every day and because we have got used to it, we do not do nearly enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this House is prepared to raise $500 million to prevent some proportion of 500 people dying, what should it be doing, if its motives are genuine and not just prompted by these sorts of flushes on issues? Why aren't we deciding to work hard and have some decent funding? Maybe you should keep the Medicare levy alive for research into heart disease and cancer. I think the place would be a lot more credible if we did, because this fund raising and expenditure that we are debating now is a knee&hyphen;jerk reaction to an aspect of life and death in Australia which, by any comparison, results in very small numbers of deaths. I am not saying we should not approach it, but I would rather the $500 million had gone into those areas where death results from the health problems which are the real mass killers and which, as I say, kill many more people every day of the year than died at Port Arthur. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was refreshing to hear the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) after the pious platitudes we got from the member for Banks (Mr Melham), who clearly does not understand the issue&mdash;or, if he does, is prepared to submerge it in some ideological nonsense or web which he has spun for himself. I predict that in the foreseeable future we will see conflict break out amongst various ethnic groups in Australia. I do not think it is too unrealistic to say we will see violence between warring groups of the Lebanese community. When that happens, they will have military style guns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Firearms Program Implementation Bill that we are debating is the result of a very bad decision on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I was complaining to a senior Liberal about this. He said I must understand that Howard had a very strong religious conviction for what he was doing. That may be so. It does not excuse bad law. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3336"> Law that cannot be enforced is bad law. Law that is going to make criminals out of innocent, decent people is evil law. That is going to be the net result of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been based right from the start on a false premise. We were told by the Prime Minister and by every advocate for this legislation that we cannot afford to go down the American road, that that would be a disaster. Every member of this House knows this is the one area where we are not going down the American road; we are going blindly down the American road in so many other ways, but in this area we are clearly not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gun related violence is dropping in Australia. It has dropped since statistics were first kept in 1915. As the member for O'Connor said, suicide accounts for by far the greatest number of deaths&mdash;in fact, 400 males and 20 females. If you want to do something about the number of suicides&mdash;and I certainly think we should&mdash;you do not tackle it effectively by way of a gun law, because you only need one bullet for suicide. You should tackle it through its cause, which is overwhelmingly the economic system. Economic pressure is what drove a lot of those people to suicide, particularly in rural areas. Break&hyphen;up of families also contributes significantly to both suicide and murder. There is absolutely no doubt about that. The Family Law Court is out of control. Nobody is prepared to tackle it. The child support system is also visibly unfair. They have been the biggest drivers of suicide, which is not going to be affected by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if you do ban all guns, every single gun, you will not reduce the suicide rate. There are other countries that have far higher suicide rates and they do not use guns. One phenomenon which seems to be emerging in Australia is suicide by way of the head&hyphen;on crash. Ambulance people have told me that in their view these crashes are very often simply suicide, which puts enormous trauma on the other party, I think quite unfairly. I would rather that people made their own individual arrangements if they are going to commit suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, we must look at the cost involved&mdash;$500 million, as the member for O'Connor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said. If you want to use this money to save lives, how many more lives would be saved if you spent it on dangerous parts of our highways, on road engineering? What about diabetes research? Diabetes, with all its attendant complications, is probably the biggest cause of death in this nation. I believe that with suitable investment we could get vast improvements, certainly for the quality of life of people. But, of course, that would be too logical to be entertained by a Prime Minister who was simply grandstanding on a tragedy that occurred in Australia&mdash;a tragedy on which his actions will have no effect at all; he knows that&mdash;and a tragedy that will occur again because its occurrence is driven by factors other than the availability of guns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the member for O'Connor that there is no need for military style self-loading rifles or automatic weapons. It should be noted here that, while members supporting this legislation confidently talk about automatic weapons, automatic weapons have been illegal in this country since 1928. That does not mean that you cannot get them; of course you can get them. They are available on the black market now and they will be available after this legislation is passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government always had the power to ban the import of these weapons and it did not do so. That is the hypocrisy of governments. The Labor Party was just as culpable as the present government. It always had the power to ban the import of these weapons and it did not do it&mdash;something that was screaming out to be done. That is a matter of irrefutable fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my lifetime, on three occasions I have had to rely on professional shooting for a living. In the 1950s I was shooting both rabbits and kangaroos. In 1970, with the pastoral downturn, I existed largely by shooting kangaroos. I had a high powered 243 rifle with a mag&hyphen;power scope. I know that with that bolt action rifle I could do far more damage than anyone could ever do with a self-loading 22. It is not unreasonable that with a gun like that you would be able to group the five shots in the magazine in a cigarette packet at 200 yards, something you simply cannot do with a 22. The truth is that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3337"> this legislation is largely going to ban the 22 self-loading rifles and shotguns. These types of guns are not the problem in Australia but they are the ones we are going to attack because they are the visible targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How are we going to attack these types of guns? A fellow came to my office and said, `My mother gave me this gun on the farm when I was 16. I have not fired it in years, but she is dead now and I am not going to give up.' I said, `Is it registered?' He said, `It was registered in South Australia but if they come for it I have lost it.' That man has an emotional attachment to that gun. If he is caught with it after legislation goes through, he is looking at draconian penalties. If he is in South Australia he would be up for a $20,000 fine and/or four years in gaol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have talked about uniform gun legislation. In Tasmania it is a $5,000 fine and two years in gaol. Two years in gaol for owning a gun like that is absolutely draconian. If we want to make this legislation work we are going to have to impose those penalties. You will see public opinion turn massively against this sort of legislation. Two years in gaol if you are in Tasmania is draconian. In South Australia the penalty is far, far worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The police ministers looked at crimping some years ago, in 1987 I think it was, and decided it was not worth the effort. But there is no doubt that crimping would have limited the shotguns to two cartridges&mdash;exactly as the member for O'Connor said. The fact that the Prime Minister refused to accept that in the face of the advice from all the police ministers from every state was an act of sheer panic. He was frightened that he would be seen as weak and ineffectual if he accepted this very logical amendment. That is a very unfortunate and sad way to be making laws in this country. The member for O'Connor was right. The banning of self-loading shotguns in the sporting area will impact disproportionately on women and young people because they are the people who use them most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the proposed legislation in Western Australia. Western Australia always had the tightest gun laws in Australia. Had the Prime Minister acted in a responsible <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> manner he could have got the Western Australian legislation across the whole nation. Now we have blown it because we have a mishmash of laws that are unenforceable and which will not be enforced. There will be very low levels of compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia now the green paper proposes to take away trial by jury for gun related defences. Does anyone seriously believe that if this erosion of civil liberties is allowed it will not spread? After all, if you are not going to have trial by jury in this area why should you have it in others? Of course it will spread. It reduces the onus of proof. It gives the right of entry to the police on the basis that they think you might have a gun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many years ago in Western Australia we gave this right to fisheries inspectors, which at the time I said was a draconian intrusion into people's civil liberties. A fisheries inspector would enter your house without any warrant and search your refrigerator. Fortunately there were very few fishing inspectors. But now we are arming every single policeman in the state with the same power. If anyone thinks this will not be used for intimidation or fishing expeditions by the police force, then they are living in cuckoo land. It will be used that way. It will be used to harass people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another problem is that the legislation puts all aspects after the bill is passed into the regulations and gives the power to the police commissioner, who could wake up tomorrow and for no reason other than sheer caprice say, `I have decided to ban single shots' or even slingshots, and there is no appeal against it. This denies the parliament the right to discuss this matter. It denies the public the right to be able to lobby their politicians on it. It is another example of what has happened so much in this country, where politicians have abdicated their responsibilities and passed their rights, powers and influence over to individuals. It is very worrying. It is about time we in parliament stopped doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was at Halls Creek the other day where, as members would have seen in the newspapers, there was a riot involving about 200 Aboriginal people. It is not a new occurrence. It simply got out of control. The same sort of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3338"> thing has happened on previous occasions and the police have been able to control it, so it did not get the big publicity. On this occasion they lost control and substantial damage was done, probably significantly less than the media reported. I suspect that the cost of the damage was probably less than $300,000&mdash;not the reported $1 million&mdash;and that it was fairly limited: the police station, a roadhouse and minimal damage in other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say in passing that, while that behaviour of those Aboriginal people&mdash;they were not Aboriginals from Halls Creek; they were from the desert communities&mdash;was inexcusable, there were reasons for it. The reasons are longstanding, have been festering for a long time and have never been addressed. In fact, it goes back to the time when Gerry Hand was the minister. Gerry Hand spent over $4 million in the Balgo area. Contrary to the wishes of the people, the money was wasted. Had it been put into Balgo, this incident might not have happened. Quite frankly, young people in Balgo live today in mind-numbing boredom, and so a visit to Halls Creek for a rodeo is a big event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened on that occasion? They came in with money. When the money was gone, they were at the point of going back when a whole lot of money was distributed to them in Halls Creek instead of back on the station. What happened in Halls Creek pales into insignificance, in my view, when measured against the behaviour of people in the assault on Parliament House the other day. For them, there was no excuse. It was an un&hyphen;Australian act of gross vandalism. The union movement was extremely naive not to realise that there were certain elements there that were looking for that sort of publicity. Of course, they have done to the whole union movement a lot of damage, and that is very unfortunate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the height of the riot at Halls Creek, when the police had retreated into the police station, the public could still communicate with them by phone, and many people did phone up and ask, `What do we do?' The advice from the police was, `If you can't leave town, arm yourselves with whatever you can get. You have to look after your own <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interests, your own family.' Many people in Halls Creek&mdash;business people&mdash;did exactly that. They stood guard, with guns, on their own premises until the crisis had passed. I think they did exactly the right thing. Had I been there, I would have done exactly the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can you now take those guns off those people when the police in that town have said, `This is all we can advise you to do'?  I suspect there will be a very low level of compliance in Halls Creek, and so there should be. It is quite clear that self&hyphen;protection, the protection of your assets and the protection of your family is a right that every single citizen should have and should be able to exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing here $500 million of clearly unnecessary expenditure. The legislature could have taken away military style guns, but the House should realise that these guns could only be confiscated, could only be claimed, with the support of the shooting fraternity. You had that support. The sporting shooters know who has these guns, they know there is no need for them, and they were quite happy to support the government in getting control of these guns, but that goodwill has been lost. That goodwill will not now be forthcoming, and these guns in vast numbers have gone underground and will continue to go underground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A great opportunity was lost by a posturing Prime Minister. It will be some time before the ramifications of this are seen, and it will be seen to be ineffective. When we talk about gun registration, let us remember that New Zealand abandoned it because it did not work. The advice of the Victoria Police was to abandon it because it was not working. You have only to look at the tragedy in Tasmania where it is now quite clear that the gun used was in fact handed in in a police amnesty in 1987. How do we explain this? The system has not worked in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of this parliament know&mdash;and I have been told by policemen&mdash;that many of these guns were grabbed by policemen for their collections because there were obviously some very interesting guns amongst them. Today I do not own a gun, but I certainly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3339"> resent the fact that, if I now decided that I wanted to go recreational shooting again, I would find it very difficult to get a gun again. I resent that very strongly, because I do not intend to engage in the mass slaughter of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the tragedy at Port Arthur, the warnings were there. This guy had been certified. Reports, we now know, were made about his behaviour, and no action was taken. There was a breakdown in the mental health system. We have seen that happen right across this nation. There have been cuts under both governments. The Labor Party did the same thing. For reasons of political correctness, I suspect, we are putting people out in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these people are quite harmless in the community but are a danger to themselves. They were much better in professional care. The quality of life of these people has dropped enormously. That is probably the root cause of the Port Arthur tragedy. It is not going to be addressed by this sort of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that the Prime Minister knows that it is not going to be addressed by this legislation, and every member of this parliament, if they think logically and rationally about it, knows that that is the case. They simply voted for a knee&hyphen;jerk reaction because they thought it was popular to do so.</PARA></SPEECH>

We all, in the political process and in the legislative process, have the opportunity to oppose laws and to give our points of view on them. For someone who has just come out of 13 years in opposition, there were plenty of laws that the Labor government brought in that I opposed, but never once did I advocate that anybody affected by any of those laws would be justified in not complying with the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to address the substance of the speech we have just heard, which attacked all sorts of people, because it is an irrelevant speech in the context of the actual debate we are supposed to be having here. I am tempted&mdash;because I was deeply offended by many <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the things that were said&mdash;but I am not going to allow that speaker to pull me into the same area, contrary to the standing orders, as he went into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1996 authorises payments to the states for three essential purposes: compensation to firearm owners and dealers, payments to the states and territories for purposes directly connected to the compensation scheme and the implementation of the new nationwide licensing and registration scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke on the Medicare Levy Bill, which was essentially when we had our so-called gun control debate in this place, and put on the record then my views on the subjects of guns and gun control. I do not intend to revisit that subject. There are a couple of things I would like to add in the light of events that have happened since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always felt that passing the laws here and in the state and territory legislatures was not the end of the story, as, I am afraid, many people seem to think is the case. Only full compliance with those laws will bring us to the end of the story. I think the process will take some time; it will not be overnight. There may still be an occasion when people who are offended by the change in our gun ownership laws will be able to point the finger, as the previous speaker did prospectively, at certain incidents and say, `There you are. It can still happen. That shows that your gun laws are no good and that they ought to be thrown out.' That conclusion, of course, will not be accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some real sympathy, I must say, for the police forces of this country because of the situations they will face in days to come in trying to enforce compliance with the laws. I suspect they will receive an amount of information about guns that have been illegally held&mdash;and, I suspect, in a number of cases that information will come from the female partners of the owners of the guns. The police are not going to be in a very pretty position when they go to take a gun off someone who has decided to break the law by keeping a banned gun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, we are going to be asking the police forces to put themselves at some risk. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3340"> If our policemen and policewomen feel that they are being put in that position under the aegis of a government or a minister who is not fair dinkum about the law, we will find a very understandable reluctance on the part of police to enforce the law, to do their searches properly and not just report back that all they found, as the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said, was a couple of marijuana plants in the bathroom instead of the gun they were looking for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vigilance only starts now. It has taken some effort to get agreement from all the state and territory governments to introduce legislation&mdash;not all of which has yet been passed&mdash;of the standard that was agreed at the national meeting of police ministers in May and at subsequent meetings. It is going to take continued vigilance by this parliament&mdash;all parliaments&mdash;and the public, in their support for the proposals to have them properly put into law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, along with every other member of parliament I am sure, have received a number of letters from gun owners saying that we are turning gun owners like them into criminals. We are not. By passing the laws we have not turned them into criminals, because the laws are not retrospective. There is, in fact, an amnesty until 30 September next year. It is those gun owners who break the new laws who will be the criminals. You do not become a criminal by the mere passing of a law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We seem to have basically walked away from retrospective legislation in this parliament at least. We pass laws every day. We have just handed down a budget that will bring in its train a raft of changed conditions in a number of areas. None of those laws will say that anybody who did something in the past which they will not be allowed to do in the future is a law breaker. If they did it under the law, they did not break the law. As a general rule, there is not retrospectivity in our laws, and there will not be any in the laws that we will be looking at in the next few days and months in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the breaking of the law, not the passing of a law, that decides whether or not someone is a criminal. Any piece of legislation can change conditions for certain behaviour. It is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not the legislation itself that defines someone as the criminal, as I have said. It is, therefore, a matter of some concern that certain people in the so-called gun lobby are urging gun owners to break the law by burying their guns and not complying with the requirement to hand them in. However, it should cause everyone a great deal of concern that there are people using the forum of the parliament to urge a low level of compliance with the laws. Some people are sore losers, it appears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage I want to diverge a little&mdash;and it is not irrelevant because it buttresses the argument I have been trying to put forward&mdash;to the subject of a gun control rally that was held in my electorate on the Gold Coast last month. A number of important things happened there. They were important to me in their significance and I think they were important to participants. I want to place on the record very quickly that it was not my intention to use this bill to make a speech about the rally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My thanks go to a number of people for their assistance either in agreeing to speak at that rally or in helping to organise it. That assistance covered all political parties. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was, of course, the principal speaker at the rally, but the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Cheryl Kernot, also spoke. When asked, she agreed very promptly to do so and I thought she made a very valuable contribution to that rally. The whole rally was apolitical in those terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, I was really quite moved by the number of people who went to the Prime Minister at the end of the rally, shook his hand and identified themselves as lifelong Labor voters. A number of them identified themselves as Labor Party members. From those, a number of them identified themselves further as presidents of Labor Party branches. To me, the significance of that has nothing to do with getting votes&mdash;not in the nauseating sense that was suggested earlier in this debate. Those people were very clearly saying to the Prime Minister: `I am Labor and nothing's going to change that, but I want to congratulate you on what you are doing.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3341">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was moved because it was only four months earlier that this man&mdash;the leader of the Liberal Party&mdash;had been responsible for putting their party into opposition. I understand only too well what sort of trauma that is for longstanding party members after 13 years in government. I believe it took some courage and guts on their behalf to come forward and shake John Howard's hand and say, `Well done,' at the same time declaring their political allegiance. But they did it with smiles on their faces, and they meant it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it meant a great deal to John Howard, as it meant a great deal to me, in terms of an indication of just how strong the feeling is out in the community in support of what the parliaments of Australia have been doing over recent months towards gun control. For all those letters that I have had from people saying that we are passing laws that will be a mockery because they will not be complied with and we are passing laws that turn them into criminals, I have had many more letters and messages from people saying that this is the way people want Australia to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like all the state and territory police ministers to also understand that very clearly. There are one or two who have given the impression of paying lip&hyphen;service to what they have agreed to do. They must carry through. They must recognise the strength of community feeling across all political parties. Whilst I said I do not believe passing this legislation is a vote&hyphen;getting exercise, I really believe that any police minister or premier or chief minister who, in due course, is not fair dinkum about implementing this legislation will suffer an electoral penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the very least, all legislators owe it to every law enforcement individual, every policewoman and every policeman in this country to stand very firmly behind them in the not very pleasant&mdash;in fact, downright dangerous in a number of instances, I am sure&mdash;task that some of them may have ahead of them. If the police feel the legislators just wanted to put this legislation into place to give them the dirty job and they were not really all that strong on it, then they would be very justified in treading very gingerly&mdash;and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> perhaps not being as thorough as they might otherwise be&mdash;whenever they are sent out on those unpleasant and even dangerous missions in the implementation of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have many things I could say about gun control, and have said in the past. Perhaps there will be debates in the future. I hope not. This bill, which is an implementing bill, giving the legislative basis for implementation of the gun control legislation that has either been passed by parliaments around Australia or will be very shortly, is the next step, and I welcome it and support it. I urge my government, the Howard government, and every other government in Australia to make sure that they keep faith with what this legislation is all about.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of this firearms legislation. In doing so, I would like to make some remarks about the way this country may go or may not go. It is particularly pertinent, given the fact that we had a budget last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is now an expectation and acceptance in the community that political parties of all persuasions are seeking actively to change a culture which almost encouraged the access to and use of firearms, both heavy and light powered. It was almost seen to be a rite of manhood to prove oneself in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That cultural change has to start somewhere. It could have started 10 years ago. It could have started last year, when the previous government was seeking to get the states to agree to some changes. It would have been wonderful if the leadership of the Liberal Party and National Party in those days had seen the wisdom of acting sooner. Perhaps Port Arthur could have been averted if there had been that political courage in those days. But the fact now is that the current opposition has done what should have been done by oppositions in New South Wales and in the Commonwealth over many years&mdash;it is accepting and supporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those Labor Party members that compliment the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) do so honestly, almost saying, `We're not used to your party doing that,' because, in effect, they have had eight or 10 years of doing the opposite&mdash;of winding up the gun lobby. In <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3342"> fact, I was approached by a gun owner at the weekend who was telling me chapter and verse Liberal Party policy and commitments from the last election, which I was not aware of and which are certainly quite contrary to what they are doing now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In saying that, it is important to keep in mind though that this really is a small part of the change&mdash;in effect, the easy part. Automatics and semiautomatics account for some six per cent of deaths by guns. The vast bulk of the deaths are from single&hyphen;shot .22s and single&hyphen; or double&hyphen;barrel shotguns. They account for something like 70 per cent. They are not affected in this legislation, in a way, because they are not being recovered. But, of course, they do affect an awful lot of households and an awful lot of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will be of concern to the community at large, and certainly should be of concern to all parliamentarians, is that while, on the one hand, the government and the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) said in the second reading speech, `This government has agreed to provide assistance to the states on such a scale to demonstrate national leadership in dealing with the problem of gun control'&mdash;and we all say, `Hear, hear,' and all support that&mdash;what we are seeing is a one-off measure to recover weapons which account for only six per cent of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This comes the day after the budget has massively cut support to the states. It will cost a lot more than this to monitor, maintain and service the gun register and the community. Establishing a gun register and recovering guns is important, but this must be monitored in households where there is domestic violence and manic depression. Licences expire&mdash;and then what will happen? Are the guns still there? All the issues that we know are part of the problem are not covered by this levy. What is happening here should be a natural and normal part of government expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government is telling the states that it will help pay to recover the guns, and we all support that; but all the costs of monitoring afterwards&mdash;of checking AVOs and DVOs, manic depression amongst children and the kinds of issues that coincide with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> guns and the problems leading to death by guns&mdash;will be the states' problem. If it is good enough for the Commonwealth to show leadership in gun recovery and put funds towards it, it is equally good for the Commonwealth to show leadership and put funds towards the resources the states will need to actually monitor what happens afterwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact we have done the opposite. Most states will be forced to cut their police budgets as a result of last night's budget. Most states will be forced to cut the money available to the police forces to monitor gun control. That is not keeping faith with the Australian people, nor is it keeping faith with the spirit of this legislation or the speeches that have been made for so many months. The community has a reasonable expectation now that, because there is unanimity on both sides of the parliament, this issue will keep going. Last night they would have expected some provision in the budget for an ongoing commitment to help the states shift resources into this area. The fact is that it is not there, and that is disappointing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has to question and wonder whether or not the commitment from the government extends only to making a levy available. This is a one&hyphen;off levy for one purpose. Funds need to be made available in every budget every year to the states to maintain that register, to check the register of gun owners and the sorts of households where guns are kept, and to check households where there are domestic violence or apprehended violence orders, manic depression and other kinds of problems. In New South Wales alone in the last year there were almost 4,000 breaches of AVOs and DVOs that we know of. We do not know how many households do not have them, and domestic violence is a major problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also see an escalation in family stress, particularly amongst the unemployed and low income families, after last night's budget. So the actual pressure on families will in fact go up and not down. This build&hyphen;up of pressure is likely to induce more problems at the same time as there is potential, for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3343"> first time ever, to seriously change the culture of the way guns are held and kept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People say to me that gun registers do not work and they cite country after country, but I have not yet seen a country that has done it properly. Doing it properly means making sure that these things are checked year by year and that the networking between&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FI4">Mr ALLAN MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, I am serious. If the member goes into rural Australia, as I did, and talks to homeless children about the causes of domestic violence, about suicide, and finds out what goes on in those households, he will find that people know about it&mdash;the information is available&mdash;but no&hyphen;one knows there is a gun in the same house where these problems are occurring, because we have not had a register before. There is a need for state police, community services and education authorities to be linked together, but that requires money and all the states have just had their budgets cut.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There needs to be forward thinking to deal with the issues that flow from this legislation. It is not simply good enough to recover the guns. We have to go to the next step, otherwise the momentum will be lost. This legislation deals with only six per cent of deaths by guns and 13 per cent by hand guns. Seventy per cent of the deaths are from .22s, non&hyphen;automatic guns and shotguns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 28 July in Newcastle there was a rally in support of these measures and the move towards gun control. I want to publicly express my appreciation to Dr John Bolton, who organised that rally, and to the hundreds of people who turned out. It was a very unpleasant day and the rally had to be shifted because of the weather. In those circumstances the turn&hyphen;out was very high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speakers at that rally all indicated not only their support but also a preparedness to stay involved and a unanimity to maintain some momentum. They look to us in the federal parliament for leadership to continue this process because they all recognise that automatics and semiautomatics are only part of the problem. It would be a great betrayal of them if the current government does not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> maintain the initiative in terms of servicing the issues leading to death by guns. Having a gun register, knowing where guns are and who has them and correlating that to households where there are serious domestic problems and other serious problems will be of major importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not often we have unanimity in this parliament on issues like this. The tragedy is that we did not see it five or 10 years ago and change the culture much sooner. The fact is that we have seen it now. This is important from the opposition's point of view, because we have had eight years of harassment by the gun lobby. Year after year we have received letter after letter and we have stood firm in our support for these kinds of measures. That support should continue, but most of us would like to take it to the next stage. We want to be part of the next part of the solution, which is helping to support the states. The states have had their budgets cut. State police budgets are under enormous stress and now the states will be forced to choose whether they take police off the beat and put them on gun registers. That is an unfair choice for them to make, because it is a national issue. The national government should be putting funds towards these measures in a particular and specific way&mdash;not by a levy but as part of a normal national budgetary issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think today marks an important day, but it is not the end of the process. In a sense, it is really the easiest part. The recovery of guns is the easiest part. The hardest part is the ongoing monitoring of where guns are and where households are in strife.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I encourage all of those in this parliament to recognise that the unanimity that has come through so far can be maintained, but it requires the government to initiate proposals. As I said, last night's budget is not that encouraging, but the states are going to need Commonwealth support. They cannot afford the extra resources out of their own budgets, which have now been cut. Alternatively, they will face problems in shifting resources within their police services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at New South Wales, at the moment the need for a shift of resources into the whole area of paedophilia and child abuse is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3344"> enormous. At the same time, they are being asked to shift resources into gun control. They are going to find that very difficult without national leadership and national support. I repeat the quote I made earlier from the second reading speech of the minister. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government has agreed to provide assistance to the states on such a scale to demonstrate national leadership in dealing with the problem of gun control.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a very broad statement. We did not see that last night. We did not see anything in the budget saying, `This is money towards ongoing gun control.' We simply saw the money from the levy for gun recovery. Gun recovery is not gun control. Those opposite talk about gun control in their speeches. We want to see some action on gun control into the future, not simply on recovery. With those words, I indicate my support for the legislation. I trust that after today we will see some advances.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to commend the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and, indeed, the opposition for joining in helping Australia to have a uniform approach to the firearms issue. We all know about the tragedy which took place in Port Arthur and the sad events of that day which saw so many people lose their lives. Obviously there had to be a national response and there was a meeting in Canberra of police ministers from right across the country. Every state and territory and the Commonwealth were represented. Ministers came with a view to implementing uniform controls over firearms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were vigorous negotiations and discussions, as one would appreciate, but at the end of the day unanimity was achieved. Representatives of all parts of the country came together. They spoke in one mind and with one voice. The result has been uniform firearms legislation, which is in the process of being implemented throughout the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Various state leaders ought to be commended because it was not easy for some of them. When one confronts a difficult subject as an elected representative, it is important to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consider all views in the community. At the end of the day the consensus was that there ought to be national firearms laws; that there ought to be a national policy. All states and territories, as well as the Commonwealth, ought to be commended for sticking to the agreement which was reached during the meetings of police ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think most Australians also applaud the leadership of the Prime Minister. He was prepared to stand up and be counted on this issue at a time when he was not certain it was at all popular; he stood up on principle. The Prime Minister, of course, has been vilified by certain minority groups, but at the end of the day, very early in his career in that high office, he has proven to the people of Australia that he is prepared to stand up and be counted. That is a very good sign that John Howard will be an excellent Australian Prime Minister for a great length of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the opposition joined with us on this issue. In fact, the Commonwealth parliament spoke with almost one voice and led the way. The Commonwealth government, supported by the opposition, went to the meeting of police ministers and a series of resolutions resulted. The legislation before this parliament implements the Commonwealth's part in that deal. Most of the changes to firearm legislation, quite necessarily, are changes to state law and one by one the state jurisdictions are carrying out their end of the bargain. The Commonwealth is to be responsible for compensation. In fact, the council of police ministers resolved:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that a common basis for fair and proper compensation, based on the value of each firearm as at March 1996, be agreed between jurisdictions to prevent gun owners from offering their firearms to the State/Territory which offers the `best price'.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth has come forward with details of what the compensation will be. The Prime Minister has indicated, with the support of the opposition, that we are going to increase the Medicare levy on a one&hyphen;off basis to fund this buyback of firearms. The legislation currently before the House implements all of those arrangements.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3345">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1996 appropriates money for financial assistance to the states, to the Australian Capital Territory and to the Northern Territory in connection with the implementation of the national firearms program. The appropriation is for the purpose of payments to the states and territories so that they may be reimbursed for compensation payments made by them to persons who hand in self-loading rifles, self-loading shotguns and pump action shotguns as part of the nationwide amnesty and compensation for surrender scheme agreed by the Australasian Police Ministers Council on 10 May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appropriation is also for the purposes of payments to the states and territories so that they may be reimbursed for compensation to gun dealers for surrender of stock and associated loss of business in accordance with the principles agreed upon by the Australasian Police Ministers Council on 17 July 1996. The appropriation is additionally for the purposes of payments to the states and territories and by the Commonwealth for purposes connected to the compensation for surrender scheme and for the implementation of the new national licensing and registration schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Appropriately, payments for reimbursement for compensation will be limited to compensation for firearms surrendered during the nationwide amnesty period. That is a very great incentive for people to observe the terms of the national amnesty. There will be no compensation paid if firearms are not surrendered during the amnesty period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a financial impact statement and the payments will be funded out of the gun levy, which is, as I mentioned a moment ago, a one-off increase in the Medicare levy for the income year 1996-97. It has been estimated that the amounts involved will be in the order of some $500 million. While most of the payments are likely to be made in 1996-97, it is anticipated that some may not be made until the following financial year. It ought to be also recognised that if there is a surplus, if all of the moneys are not paid out, then those moneys would be returned to the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to see the Commonwealth parliament playing its role in relation to the firearms issue. The states one by one have been putting through their parliaments legislation to implement their end of the bargain. Of course this legislation is the Commonwealth's contribution to the national response to the Port Arthur massacre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to commend the Attorney-General because he and the Prime Minister have borne the brunt of the anger of certain minority groups. Both of them have been prepared to listen. The result is: following the police ministers conference, we now have this national regime in the process of implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a great unanimity of support on this issue right across the Australian community. When one looks at opinion polls it is clear that the government and elected representatives have got it right. We are speaking for mainstream Australia. We are speaking for people who say, `No more Port Arthurs.' We are speaking for people who demanded that as elected representatives we bring forward an effective response which will make Australia in the long term a much safer place in which to live.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate in the Queensland parliament some years ago was enormously bereft of any sense of scholarship or intellectual content from those people opposing the position that I had, which was the state National Party position. The debate on this issue has been characterised by exactly the same total lack of any intellectual content or any rational argumentation. Let me go through it in some form of chronological or at least rational order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia today, it would appear from the figures I have seen&mdash;not my figures, but the figures of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;there are probably something like 20 million firearms. Most certainly half a million firearms have been coming into Australia every year. Even though firearms, if not looked after, do not last a long time, I still think that is a reasonable figure. Most certainly, 15 million would be. Even with an average of three or four guns for every person, you are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3346"> looking at maybe 40 per cent, most certainly 30 per cent, of households in Australia being protected in some way by a firearm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), talked about mainstream Australia. If one-third of the people in Australia have their homes protected by a firearm, a very significant proportion of the Australian population are involved in this issue. Every one of those people believes it is not only their right to be able to protect their wife, their kids and their home in the wider sense of the word, but also their moral obligation. They have been brought up to believe it is their duty to protect their brothers, their sisters, their children and their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you believe that is a right that is not relevant today, that it is a sort of frontier mentality that we should condemn, that it is part of the Australian psyche which has to be cut out like a cancer, then I would argue that the last media report I read says that there is a home invasion every three minutes in Australia. I don't know whether the report was exaggerated, but I do know that one of the mass circulation dailies in Queensland used to run a column each week which would just state the home invasions for the week. That is how common they are. My own family and my wife's family in Brisbane can clock up something like 21 home invasions amongst some 10 or 15 houses. It is becoming an extremely common phenomenon and, statistically speaking, most people in Australia will encounter a home invasion at some time in their life. It is an issue that is most relevant in Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a proposition being put forward by the book burners, those who would take away the guns. The member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) from the ALP spoke earlier and it was quite clear he intends to take guns off everybody. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that at some future time we will be taking what is left. Once we have all the guns on the register, we will know where they are and we can take them off everyone a lot more easily. There is no doubt in my mind that we are heading down that pathway, and each of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the previous speakers clearly indicated that was what was intended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition being put forward here is: `Give us your guns. We're from the government; we're here to protect you. You'll be quite safe now because we're going to take these guns off you. We're going to look after you.' If you have one of these monsters of the night in your house and you ring the police, the average down time&mdash;and I am not blaming governments for this; I think it would be almost impossible to cut it down&mdash;is about 26 minutes. That is of course if you are a lucky enough to live in a city where the police are on hand 24 hours a day. In most country centres that most certainly is not the situation. Sometimes it can be very difficult to get a policeman at all. In fact there are over 40 towns in my electorate that don't have policemen at all. I don't know what they do, but we don't have to worry about them because we never worry about those people!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in the cities of Australia you have a 26-minute wait time. I remember during the argument in the state house in Queensland&mdash;I think it was about the Surrey Hills case in Sydney&mdash;I said, `If you take the guns off people, how do we protect ourselves from these dreadful people who lurk in the shadows of the night?' The now Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Mr Beattie, said, `You call the police.' I said, `That's good. I was waiting for you to say that because, according to the media reports I read about Surrey Hills, the police were called when the first shot was fired.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The man proceeded to kill everybody in the first flat. He then went to the second flat and killed everybody in the second flat. He then went on to kill everybody in the third flat. He was using a 12&hyphen;gauge shotgun, so everybody waited in terror for their turn to arrive whilst they sat waiting for the police to arrive. He then completed the destruction of six or seven human beings, put his gun aside, walked up the street and was on his second cup of cappuccino up the road by the time the police arrived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the proposition being put forward here by the people who want to disarm every single house and community and remove from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3347"> people the right to protect themselves in their own homes. The proposition being put is that we will wait for the police to arrive. I venture to suggest to you that it was a little bit late at Surrey Hills. It was a little bit late at Hoddle Street. It was a little bit late at Port Arthur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to know that my family have the ability to protect themselves against this sort of thing occurring. My faith would not be in the government's ability to protect us. The sad list of tragedies indicates most clearly that the government's ability to protect us is not anywhere near good enough. Nor will it be in future years, because you could spend a massive amount of money and the reaction time would not be lowered very effectively from 26 minutes. I know&mdash;because I was in a government where we seriously discussed on a number of occasions lowering the reaction time&mdash;that the sort of money that you would have to spend to lower that reaction time below 26 minutes is such that no government could possibly afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those that say that they are not removing your right to protect your wife, your kids and your home from these terrible monsters, let me read section 3A to you, because it really is an incredible statement. I have to say that, with all due deference to the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams). Section 3A reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Council resolved that personal protection not be regarded as a genuine reason for owning, possessing or using a firearm.</PARA>
<PARA>I did a number of national interviews and every single one of them was enormously hostile. They regarded me as some sort of extreme lunatic&mdash;that was the attitude that they had towards me. I would say, `Do you think it is a reasonable proposition that you are not allowed to protect your wife and kids with a firearm if you have got someone in there threatening them?' In my state the Premier, the Deputy Premier and the Minister for Police said before the last election that they would have no hesitation in shooting someone who came in and threatened their wives and children. That is on the media record of the state of Queensland. If I am a lunatic, I think you would have to include the Premier, the Deputy Premier and the Minister for Police in that state.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is illegal for you to use a firearm to protect your wife and kids. That is resolution 3A. It is a most remarkable statement. I said to the interviewers, `Do you accept that proposition?' Even the most hostile of those interviewers, when confronted with 3A, said, `No, that really is going far too far.' I said, `All right. Is the proposition being put forward by people like myself unreasonable?' They said, `With respect to 3A it most certainly is not.' I can go back and reel off all the people that were interviewed, but I suppose almost every principal interviewer in Australia would have been included in that group of people. Every single one of those people accepted the proposition that 3A was totally unreasonable and unacceptable to the vast bulk of people&mdash;and to almost every single Australian, I would venture to submit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having been a legislator for 22 years, I have learnt by bitter experience that you do not just take a facile superficial view of something. You look at it and you say, `What will happen if we do this?' Let us look at what will happen if we do this&mdash;and we are doing it. The reason we are doing it is to stop Port Arthurs and Hoddle Streets. Will it stop a Port Arthur or a Hoddle Street? Both those people were flagrantly in violation of the gun laws of both those states, so clearly this legislation will have absolutely no effect on stopping a Hoddle Street or a Port Arthur from occurring in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those of you who think that it is difficult to secure a gun&mdash;I have refrained from saying how easy it is to secure a gun and I am not going to repeat it or say it anywhere but I will speak to anyone who wants to speak privately to me&mdash;let me say that the proposition that, by removing guns and making guns illegal, people are not going to be able to access guns and the sort of person who carried out this terrible crime at Port Arthur is not going to be able to access guns is really quite stupid and infantile. It is a matter of a telephone call and sending some money. That is about as difficult as it is. For those of you who do not know much about guns, of course a decent machine shop in a day, or most certainly two days, could machine up an Owen gun. Three moving metal parts is all that an Owen gun <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3348"> has. It is a machine gun, not a semiautomatic. It is an automatic machine gun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not doubt for a moment the sincerity of the Prime Minister in this. I have on many occasions attacked&mdash;and attacked without hesitation&mdash;but I do not doubt the Prime Minister's sincerity in this. But I do criticise the fact that, within four days, we were able to find a solution to the Hoddle Streets and the Port Arthurs. That was really amazing to me. The British parliament is still out. The Dunblane commission of inquiry is still out nine months afterwards. We were able to do in four days what has taken the British government some nine months&mdash;I think that is the figure&mdash;of deliberations in Great Britain. Even allowing for the lack of capacity by the English, I think that really is going a little far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting thing about Dunblane is that Dunblane occurred after the banning of firearms in Great Britain. It occurred afterwards, not before. The British government thought this was a solution that would stop this, and what happens is that afterwards they have the most horrific occurrence in all of recent British history. So they have to ask themselves the question: did we take a wrong turn? We did not question that. We know what we are doing. We are very clever. This is going to solve these problems and eliminate them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what is going to happen here. Does anyone think for one moment that Knight and the person who was involved in Port Arthur and all of these terrible people who committed the Hoddle Street and Surrey Hills massacres are going to hand their guns over? Is there anyone who would seriously stand up in public and say they are going to hand their guns over? Of course they are not going to hand their guns over.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will be. You will be taking my books off me next. That is the sort of mentality that we are dealing with here. It is the Spanish Inquisition mentality, the little wowser mentality, the self-righteous mentality, the totalitarian-authoritarian mentality. You would be very familiar with it in the Labor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Party because over the years, even when my family was a member of it, it was a hallmark for that sort of behaviour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go on and talk about the outlaw element, the hoon element. I suppose we all have friends in that class or have friends who have kids in that class. They are not bad people, but the hoons and the outlaw class in Australia are not going to hand their guns over. There are probably hundreds of thousands of people in that category. The evil people, the criminals, the corrupt&mdash;not the lunatic variety that you run into at Port Arthur and Hoddle Street but the evil people&mdash;are not going to hand their guns over. Heavens! They all have illegal hand guns now. In some cases we found that in North Queensland there are submachine guns as well. They are not going to hand their guns over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So who is going to hand their guns over? All the good people, the people who want guns to defend their wives and kids, are the people who are going to be less able to defend themselves now than they were before. That is what is going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, if 3A is implemented by the states&mdash;and I most certainly hope it is not&mdash;they will be at the mercy of these people. A home invasion takes place every three minutes in Australia. Those people will be at the mercy of the home invaders now. You people in this House have been responsible for that. So, when you say that it is upon my conscience when some of these things occur, I am sorry, but I pass a far harsher judgment upon you than you are passing on me, except I do not do it publicly and I do not intend to in the future.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX4">Mr KATTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I most certainly was not referring to you. The situation we move into now is where every house in Australia has an implied sign upon it saying, `This house is totally unprotected. You are quite safe in coming in here and robbing this house because we have no ability to defend ourselves now.' So, as far as the burglars and the home invaders of Australia <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3349"> go, this is Christmas and this is workers compensation time. It is going to fall through the floor. It is quite safe now to carry out home invasions. We will be unassailed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of these tragedies&mdash;I have the biggest mental hospital in my own home town for northern Australia&mdash;and I am, sadly, very familiar with a lot of these occurrences. As many people in this House would know, there are many domestic violence cases as well. What needed to be done was to separate the guns from the people who should have the guns taken off them. In both the Hoddle Street case and the Port Arthur case the authorities knew that these persons should have had their guns taken off them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as scholarship goes, I must pass a harsh statement here. In one press interview, and there was a large number of press, I said, `I'll write out a cheque here for $500 if one single person associated with this legislation can tell you what the Tarasoff rule means.' Nobody followed it up, so I assume that they confronted them and nobody knew what the Tarasoff rule was. I have had it explained to me by a large number of psychiatrists that the Tarasoff rule is the rule governing the relationship between a psychiatrist and his patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One psychiatrist who spoke to me a number of years ago said, `This matter needs to be addressed. You yourself, being familiar with the mental hospital and all of those things, would know the significance of the Tarasoff rule.' The Tarasoff rule is the only legal way in which a psychiatrist is able to divulge information that he has received as part of the patient-doctor relationship. That needs to be reversed. Where a dangerous situation exists and the psychiatrist knows that a dangerous situation exists, the onus should be upon him to divulge that information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, if you went back through all of those massacre cases, at least half of those would not have occurred if that action were carried out. That is one of the things being addressed by the Queensland state government, and I would like to think that I had some small contribution to make there. It is not an area I have been aggressive <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about before, because it does interfere in civil liberties. But we are taking away the civil liberties of maybe a third of the Australian population, so why should we worry about maybe 1,000 people in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other lack of scholarship in this debate was to look at what has happened in other parts of the world where guns have been banned. Guns have been banned in East Germany. East Germany has the highest homicide rate with guns in the world. So, if you are looking to ban guns as being a way of stopping these things from occurring, forget about it. East Germany puts the death knell upon your argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Switzerland&mdash;which is right next door to East Germany, for those people who are not familiar with their geography, and most of the Swiss actually speak German&mdash;every single house has an automatic military rifle. Do you know that this country, where every single house has a rifle, has, arguably, the lowest homicide rate with guns in the world? If you want to turn to the United States, exactly the same figures come up. New York, Washington DC and Chicago, where guns are virtually banned, have the highest unlawful homicide rates with guns in the world. In the southern states, which have very liberal attitudes towards guns, the homicide rate with guns is a third and a quarter of what it is in those other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to look no further than Australia. The year before we introduced restrictive legislation in Queensland, we had eight homicides with guns. In the same year, Victoria, with the most draconian and restrictive legislation in Australia, had 58 homicides with guns. But let me be fair and go to averages in the years leading up to that. Thirty-two homicides is the average for New South Wales; 36 homicides is the average for Victoria; and only 13 homicides is the average for Queensland. In other words, New South Wales had a 40 per cent higher rate than the liberal laws of Queensland and Victoria had a 100 per cent higher rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So look no further than Australia. Whether you are looking at the experience in this country, whether you are looking at the United States experience or whether you are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3350"> looking at the European experience, constantly and continuously the same set of figures comes up. I do not really know what the reason is. Mr Deputy Speaker, clearly there are not a lot of `home invasions' in Switzerland. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to thank the members who have contributed to this debate&mdash;the members for Banks (Mr Melham), O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), Fisher (Mr Slipper) and Kennedy (Mr Katter). All have demonstrated an interest in the subject and have made their individual contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading speech that I delivered yesterday I indicated that the National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1996 provides for the Commonwealth to provide funds to the states and territories for compensation for surrendered guns and for the implementation of the states' surrender and buy-back schemes. It will also enable funds to be provided for the national education campaign in relation to the firearms scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members for O'Connor, Kalgoorlie and Kennedy made a number of comments critical of the agreement reached by the Australasian Police Ministers Council on 10 May and 17 July&mdash;agreements under which all states and territories agreed on the need for and the form of uniform firearms laws. I do not propose to reply in detail to what those members said. What they had to say by way of criticism I suggest is not really directly relevant to a bill which is designed to enable  appropriation of funds for the implementation of that scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of gun owners and the overwhelming majority of the community at large have demonstrated their support for what has been agreed by the police ministers. The government is serious about ensuring that gun owners are made aware of their rights under the proposed new laws and that they receive compensation moneys for firearms to be surrendered as soon as is practicable. If the members for O'Connor, Kalgoorlie and Kennedy have the genuine concerns of firearms owners at heart&mdash;and I believe they do <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in their individual ways&mdash;I suggest that they should be supporting this bill and supporting its speedy passage through the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks spoke for the opposition and gave wholehearted support to the bill. The government is very grateful for that. The shadow minister indicated that the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus, has some reservations which are proposed to be raised. All I can say is that I do not know what those reservations are. It would have been a little more helpful if they had been raised in this House where I can respond to them rather than in the Senate where I am unable to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for O'Connor raised the issue of compensation not being available to people who have to hand in non-prohibited guns, they being in a situation where they will not have a genuine reason for possessing or owning a gun at all. He suggested that this will be a disincentive for these people to hand in their guns. The scheme does not necessarily contemplate that they will hand in their guns. It should be understood that a person presently owning a firearm which they will not be entitled to retain under the proposed new laws will be free to sell the gun. It is reasonable to assume that there may be a greater market for category A and category B firearms&mdash;that is, those subject to fewer restrictions&mdash;on the basis that those who currently hold category C or category D firearms may wish to acquire another firearm in place of the surrendered firearm. That may result in a greater market, as I suggested. We have yet to see what that impact will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Newcastle suggested that the bill should provide for an ongoing contribution by the Commonwealth in the budget for the maintenance of a system of monitoring. That really is a responsibility of the states and territories. It is the states and territories who will introduce the uniform laws which will set up the prohibited, restricted and allowed  categories and the circumstances under which the permitted categories can be held. It will be the states who are responsible for collecting the surrendered firearms and for paying compensation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3351">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system of uniform licensing of firearms and registration of gun owners will enable the states and territories to engage in monitoring. There will also be the capacity for interstate monitoring through the linking of each of the state and territory systems through the National Exchange of Police Information, NEPI, enabling, for example, a police officer in one state to know exactly what the situation is in another. Under this bill, the Commonwealth will make significant contributions to the establishment of the state and territory systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kennedy raised the question of use of firearms for personal protection. As I said, this is not directly relevant to the debate. I remind the member for Kennedy that all jurisdictions agreed that personal protection is not to be accepted as a genuine reason for owning a long-arm firearm. No jurisdiction will accordingly in its legislation provide that as a reason. He suggested that there will be difficulties with compliance. This is a common criticism offered by those who are basically opposed to what is being done. The government's view is that the overwhelming majority of firearms owners are law&hyphen;abiding citizens. They will be aware that the overwhelming majority of the community support the uniform system of registration and licensing. They will be aware that the overwhelming majority of the community, including gun owners, support the uniform system of firearms laws that is being put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easy to say that there will be a lack of compliance. In practice, it will be a great deal more difficult than those critics suggest. There will be overwhelming pressure from the community to support what is being implemented by the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Fisher referred to the role of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the establishment of the agreements. I wholeheartedly endorse his comments. Without the firm stand taken by the Prime Minister throughout the gun debate, what has been achieved would not have been achieved. I would also like to commend the Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), for the role he played in his party, the National Party. In addition, members and senators who either <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hold rural and regional seats or, in the case of senators, are associated with rural and regional areas have played a very important role in achieving a community consensus on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has given strong support from the outset, as has the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot. As the member for Banks indicated, this is not an issue for party politics. The government is grateful to members of the opposition, and to the leaders of the various parties, for their support of the national firearms laws. We also thank the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents in both houses who have given their support to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a very important part of the national firearms laws. It will enable the setting up of the system to be financed and for the surrendered firearms to be paid for. I strongly commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, an initiative of the former Labor government which is worthy of the support of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains two major initiatives. The first initiative amends the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1994 so as to increase the amount of money available under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3352"> the loan from $40,000 to $80,000 for single service people and from $80,000 to $160,000 for couples with a joint entitlement. The bill also reduces the qualification period of the home loans assistance scheme from six to five years and extends the scheme to members of the reserve and emergency forces after an eight&hyphen;year qualification period. The second initiative amends the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 so as to close a loophole in the act by bringing it into line with the Crimes Act of the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to speak briefly to the first initiative relating to defence housing assistance today. The secret to addressing personnel difficulties being experienced in the defence forces is to make the lives of our Defence Force personnel as normal as possible. I was just 10 years of age when former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam brought the last of our troops home from Vietnam. Those of my age and younger have very little memory of that conflict or any conflict before it. Last year's Australia Remembers activities and last weekend's ceremonies to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan are poignant and appropriate reminders, particularly to younger Australians, of the sacrifices made by our former service men and women and how important it is to us as a nation that we retain a strong defence force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Black Hawk helicopter accident, which occurred earlier this year, reminds us that, even in times of relative peace, the occupation that stems from membership of defence forces is very dangerous. In recent years, the Australian Defence Force has suffered the loss of many experienced and capable persons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill addresses the defence housing problem by providing a more generous and realistic level of housing assistance. As Defence Force personnel are constantly on the move, they are significantly disadvantaged in realising the great Australian dream of home ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already mentioned the importance of maintaining a strong defence force for the security of the nation. Defence Force facilities&mdash;like our universities, which were the subject of a matter of public importance <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> yesterday&mdash;represent a vital cog in many regional communities that in recent times have come under siege as a result of pre&hyphen;budget announcements and some of the announcements in the budget last night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate, I have an excellent facility in the Singleton infantry centre. Lone Pine barracks, as it is known, employs around 400 people permanently and each year hosts about 1,400 transient infantry trainees. The Singleton base, and all that goes with it, makes a significant contribution to the local economy in Singleton, as do a number of similar bases around regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The initiatives in this bill come as a result of the recommendations flowing from the Glenn report. Indeed, the former Labor government had in mind a number of initiatives to address the personnel reduction difficulties being experienced by our defence forces, including the extension of child&hyphen;care provision, the extension of compassionate leave provisions and a spouse employment program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Disappointingly, it seems the coalition has been a little slow to embrace some of those initiatives. This bill is the only example I have been able to find of their willingness to embrace change. I note that the coalition's election policy in this area contained a pledge to have this overdue change in operation by 1 July, yet because of the way in which the bill has been drafted it seems that that will not be the case. I understand that my colleague the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) will be moving an amendment later in the debate, hopefully to address that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our defence forces are our defence personnel. They are its most important cog and we must do all that we can to ensure that there is an incentive to join the defence forces. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address the House today in support of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. I will focus my comments upon items 5 to 44 inclusive, which deal with the amendments to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990. Those items which amend the current act are of particular interest <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3353"> to me in my electorate of McEwen, which contains the large army and army reserve operation at Puckapunyal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, the coalition made a commitment to serving defence families across Australia. I was very pleased to make this commitment to defence families at Puckapunyal to extend and increase the benefits available to defence personnel under the defence home owner scheme. This bill delivers on those promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before commenting on these amendments, I would like to mention the importance to Australians of the ideal of owning a home. The family home has traditionally been an icon of security and stability in Australian society. It is usually the most valuable asset that a family possesses. It is, for many, the most important investment of their life. The sense of success, prosperity and security is encapsulated in the notion that the great Australian dream is to own your own home. Many Australians are comforted by the knowledge that their retirement will be secured by home ownership. This dream is just as relevant today as it has been to past generations. The family home is security, an investment and it provides peace of mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Defence families are no different from any other Australian families in wanting to achieve this security. Historically, though, this ideal has been difficult for defence families to realise. Having been a regular visitor to Puckapunyal over the years, I know how difficult it has been for defence personnel to establish a permanent family home. The nature of the job, with its recurrent postings and removals, temporary accommodation and the difficulty of finding suitable housing often cause enormous hardship, especially for younger couples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under these circumstances, establishing the security of the family home has been difficult. Sometimes this has meant that our most promising personnel search for jobs that they feel will give them a more secure future and a better chance of settling down. Sadly, many of those jobs have been outside the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defence home loans scheme recognises the challenges faced by defence personnel and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their families. If they are to have the same opportunities as other Australians, then we must provide them with those benefits. One way of accomplishing this is the improvement of the scheme of home ownership. The doubling of the maximum amount currently available for loans will provide defence personnel with much better opportunities than are available at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make sure we have the best possible defence force, we must make sure we retain the best personnel. To encourage our young men and women to stay longer, the government will recognise the value that our defence forces provide to the nation by giving them a tangible reward for the service that they give. These hardworking people who defend the country and give our nation a sense of security deserve some of that security for themselves. This bill provides the changes which will deliver that reward and significantly improve the conditions of service for members of the Australian defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contained in this bill is a doubling of the maximum amount available for a subsidised loan under the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act to $80,000, or $160,000 where spouses have a joint entitlement. These new maximum subsidised loan limits apply to both new and existing borrowers under the current home owner scheme. The bill also introduces a reduction in the basic eligibility period that applies for new borrowers from six years continuous full&hyphen;time service to five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By increasing the feasibility and attractiveness of home ownership for Australian Defence Force members, these changes will provide a cost&hyphen;effective alternative to rental assistance. The scheme will also be extended to reservists who have completed a basic eligibility period of eight years of statutory training obligation. This bill will be warmly welcomed by my local constituency in Puckapunyal and by defence personnel Australia&hyphen;wide, because it will substantially improve the availability of long&hyphen;term, secure housing for members of our defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These improvements will encourage members to remain in our defence forces. The extension of the home owners scheme to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3354"> reservists will also come to play an important role in attracting and retaining reservists. This will in turn increase the quality of Australia's overall defence capacity. It reinforces this government's commitment to Australian defence families right throughout our nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am well qualified to be speaking on these proposed amendments to defence legislation as I was a RAAF officer before my election to this place on 2 March this year. The honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) has outlined the detail of the proposed amendments to the defence home loans scheme. However, one thing she did not mention was the terribly deleterious effect on morale that occurred in the last six years of the Labor government that has led to measures such as this one being necessary to raise the morale of our defence forces and increase retention rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my main reasons for joining the Liberal Party in 1994 was to make our political leaders aware of what was happening in defence. Each Paul Keating budget took more from defence to give to special interest groups. The loyal and motivated personnel of our Defence Force were continually being asked to do more with less. In our patriotic service industry there is no union, and no allowance for overtime and double time or teabreaks put into any awards. Our defence personnel are becoming more and more cynical and dispirited with each passing year. I know. I was in the military for the last six years. Morale had taken a significant downturn. The Dibb review had set defence spending at 2.4 per cent of GDP to maintain a credible, self-reliant defence force. This was endorsed in subsequent white papers, in the strategic 1993 review and in the 1994 white paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet we find defence spending currently at 1.9 per cent of GDP. The navy at present has 14,400 uniformed personnel, down from over 17,000. The army has 25,964 personnel, down from over 40,000. The air force is currently at 17,221, down from over 22,000. As can be seen in the Australian Defence Force, this has significantly reduced its uniformed branch in the last four or five years and has had a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> corresponding effect on morale. Believe me, when I stood for parliament morale in the defence forces was at the lowest I had ever felt it in six years. Therefore, something needs to be done to raise the morale and recognise the value of the sacrifice of our serving personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recognition in last night's budget that Australia's Defence Force had been cut to the bone and could not take any further cuts, despite a number of sacrifices that have been made across departments, went some way to restoring morale. These changes to the defence home loans scheme go further down the track of restoring Australia's Defence Force to a credible force in our region of strategic interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People join the Defence Force for various reasons&mdash;to serve their country, proud to be part of an effective uniformed branch. It is the morale, the feeling of camaraderie, the indefinable essence of being part of a team that is the effective weapon in war. The way personnel feel about their squad, platoon, company or battalion and how they consider their country to be relying on them to perform when it counts will enable outnumbered, unequipped, fatigued personnel to overcome outstanding odds, as happened in Long Tan, Milne Bay, northern Africa and Gallipoli. If there is low morale in our personnel&mdash;and 40 per cent of our defence budget is spent on personnel&mdash;that has a terribly deleterious effect on our effectiveness and our fighting capacity as a military force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The enhancement of the defence loans scheme provides incentive for military personnel to remain in the military. Their initial training is costly. If we cannot retain personnel we will not get the best defence force for the money available, which is the situation we are in at the moment. As at June this year, 13 per cent of the navy's personnel are leaving each year, 12 per cent of the army's and nine per cent of the air force's. With separation rates like that, these valued personnel resources are being wasted. When you consider that 40 per cent of the defence budget is spent on personnel, you begin to realise why morale is so important. During times of high morale, separation rates are lower.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3355">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have served in the military for over six years in my capacity as a defence lawyer. I have had cause to use the Defence Force Discipline Act, which is also proposed to be amended under this bill. Discipline is something unique to the military. It is also used to enhance morale. It is meted out equally by COs who are responsible for their troops' welfare, wellbeing and equipment and also criminal and non-military behaviour. The Defence Force Discipline Act is used to enforce a high standard of discipline, which is just not possible in a civilian workplace. The act provides for detention, fines and other judicial sentencing options for breaches of discipline in the military. It is a unique act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In today's society, the standards of morality and the codes of conduct required of our Defence Force are substantially higher than is perhaps appropriate. Where in the civilian arena you would probably be fined $100 for using marijuana, in the Defence Force it will cost you your job. The Defence Force requires a high standard of discipline from its troops and personnel. We do not look lightly on breaches of the law. The successive implementation of the Defence Force Discipline Act and its smooth implementation and enactment are important to maintaining discipline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes proposed to the Defence Act basically relate to section 62, which allows for the Crimes Act of New South Wales to be substituted with the Crimes Act of the Australian Capital Territory. This became necessary with the move from the Australian Capital Territory into statehood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Defence Force Discipline Act provides for a number of offences, both military and civil. Military offences would be things like absent without leave, not having a proper haircut or not shining your shoes or the classic section 60 offence which is the old section of conduct unbecoming a military officer. Section 61 allows for the prosecution of substantial criminal acts. This is important for personnel serving overseas so that it can be seen that the Australian military will try its own people under its own law for any actions taken overseas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is important because when I worked as a lawyer at the RAAF base in Malaysia the Malaysians would frequently give us jurisdiction if it could be seen that we were dealing with our own people. It is important that that ambiguity over that section is clarified so that we retain jurisdiction and the right to request jurisdiction from foreign powers under our own defence, our own code of conduct, in the military.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill goes some way, and this government will go even further, to regain the morale of our defence forces and that indefinable spirit within the military that adds to our fighting capacity. With foresight and vision into and throughout the next century, our defence forces will become more focused on the modern challenges facing them in technology and the demands from the personal management side of defence as well.

<PARA>The amendments that have been circulated today are in substitution for those that were provided yesterday. The amendments that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3356"> have been moved today go to the issue which I commented upon yesterday during the second reading debate. They are designed to give effect to the undertakings made by the government, prior to the election, that the increases in loan assistance for defence personnel would be available from 1 July. The Liberal Party's policy in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election was unequivocal on this point. I should record again for the purposes of the debate on this amendment the exact words that the Liberal Party put to the Australian people:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will increase the maximum loan value under the ADF home loan assistance scheme from $40,000 to $80,000 and the eligibility period will be reduced to five years. This will come into effect by 1 July 1996, not 1 January 1997 as proposed by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA>The policy, the election commitments, the statements and the propaganda of the Liberal Party were absolutely clear beyond any confusion. They said not that the bills would be introduced, not that some time later in this calendar year people will be able to get access to those higher rates of benefit, but that they would come into effect by 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, you could argue that the bill should operate from before 1 July, but the words said that they would be in effect by 1 July. Here we are in August and the bill that the government has presented does nothing of the sort. The bill the government presents would have a date of operation somewhere in the future when it is given royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday during the debate, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) interjected that she had complied with this undertaking by introducing the bill into the parliament before 1 July. That was clearly not what the Liberal Party said before the election. It was clearly not what they told the service community of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite humorous to think that the minister could stand in this place and justify honouring the undertaking by introducing the bill on 26 June&mdash;the second last day of sittings before we rose&mdash;five days before that 1 July deadline and then have the debate on the second reading start on 20 August, seven weeks after the supposed start date of 1 July. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Presumably it will not go to the Senate this week, which means that the very first opportunity for it to go to the Senate will be when we come back in the next couple of weeks on Monday, 9 September&mdash;10 weeks after 1 July. Ten weeks after the day on which it is supposed to come into effect, the Senate may, at its earliest opportunity, get to consider it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would realistically be looking at a delay of some three or four months, the absolute minimum, before this bill would be given royal assent. In fact, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that the bill would not get royal assent much before 1 January 1997 anyway. The Liberal Party's platform gave a clear commitment. Not content to have given a clear commitment that it would come into effect by, not on&mdash;that is, before or no later than&mdash;1 July, you then sought to make some political capital out of that by adding: `not 1 January 1997, as promised by Labor'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You were very clear in your intentions before the election that you would have this up and running by 1 July. You sought to make political gain out of that by saying that you would do it before the Labor government of the day had planned to do it. That is fine. I am quite happy to support that. Indeed, I now give you the opportunity to support the amendments and ensure that those people who have applied for this loan since 1 July get access to the higher rates that the bill would provide. This will test your integrity and willingness to honour your pre-election commitments and give you an opportunity to set the record straight.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very pleased, in hearing the second reading speeches of those who took part in the debate, that everyone supported the passage of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill. I also heard from both sides of the House that it was required there be an increase in the size of the mortgage that was available because this basically represents an important recruitment tool. It is different from the previous scheme&mdash;that is, the old scheme of $25,000&mdash;because it is designed to keep people in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3357">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that when the former Labor government introduced the original scheme, the $40,000 scheme, only 1,750&hyphen;odd people ever took it up. So it clearly was not working. We gave an undertaking in our policy document prior to the election that we would increase that from $40,000 to $80,000, but we went further. I heard the plaintive cries of the opposition trying to say that it was their policy. It was not. Yes, the sum of $80,000 was common to both policies but we said that we would reduce the eligibility period from six years to five years and that we would also extend it to reservists. Those two initiatives were entirely separate from anything the Labor Party ever proposed and made the whole proposition quite different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said, with very good and honest intention, that we would introduce the legislation and have it operating from 1 July. The fact of the matter is that when I became the minister I began work on the bill immediately. It was prepared and then it took its place in the queue to go before the cabinet. I introduced the bill at the earliest possible time, that being 26 June, and made my second reading speech on that occasion, which is, again, a change from the way in which the previous government used to do business when they would introduce legislation without any second reading speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original amendment the opposition moved yesterday, as I pointed out to them, cannot have any practical effect. The amendment will mislead and confuse people should it be pursued. The subsequent amendments that have come in today do not alter that proposition in any way; they simply make a couple of grammatical amendments to clauses in the bill should they have been successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), contacted my office some weeks ago and we facilitated a briefing for the shadow minister with the department on this precise issue. Does he really think that there would be some reason why I would not put 1 July 1996 in the bill if it had been so simple? Does he really think that it was something that was not considered? Does he really think that it was not something that was raised with me by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> members of the government? Of course it was. The basic fact of the matter is that you cannot retrospectively take a loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister obviously has difficulty in coming to grips with that concept so I have had a minute prepared for him. I will go through the points one by one so he can possibly understand. I have chosen to raise these matters after the amendments were moved rather than in the second reading stage of the bill when they were merely foreshadowed. So I foreshadow at this stage that I will be rising to my feet for more than one five&hyphen;minute period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue the opposition has raised is whether the amendments to the act made by the bill can be made to operate retrospectively to 1 July. As the bill is currently drafted, the amendments will come into operation with royal assent. The best thing we can do is get this bill through the parliament as quickly as we can so that it can become operative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under an amendment to the bill circulated by Mr Bevis&mdash;and the subsequent amendments do not in any way materially affect his original amendment&mdash;he would like this to become effective from 1 July. We all would, but it cannot be done. The issue of possible retrospective commencement can be understood only against the structure of the scheme as it currently operates under the act and the nature of the amendments set out in the bill. I will go through them with you so you do understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act, not the bill, established a scheme to provide for the payment of a home loan subsidy to eligible persons who are serving, or have served, the Defence Force. Key features of the scheme are as follows. Firstly, the scheme applies to eligible persons&mdash;that is, members of the Defence Force who must normally complete a period of six years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Mrs BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The fact of the matter is that you have to go through a number of steps in order to become a successful applicant. You then have to go along to the bank with your certificate, and it is then that the loan is granted; and you cannot do it retrospectively. So I would hope that before we finish the debate on this bill you will, in fact, withdraw your amendment so that people will not be confused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will read to you from the minute so that you can understand it step by step. As I have explained to you, it applies only to eligible persons. Secondly, after completing the qualifying period, the eligible member will accrue one year of loan interest subsidy entitlement for each completed year of effective full&hyphen;time service. That is why, when the application is made, you have to have served a half year in order to get a little waiver of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3359"> the full year because the services take it on trust that after serving six months after your five years&mdash;to which we are bringing the period down&mdash;you will stick around for the remaining six months so that you will have the full&hyphen;year entitlement. We do it that way to expedite it. The maximum amount of the loan is $80,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go through the procedural requirements. In order to obtain the subsidy payable, you have to go through an administrative procedure. The member applies for an entitlement certificate under section 10 of the act. An entitlement certificate is not issued unless the member meets the criteria set out in section 12 of the act&mdash;that the member is an eligible person, the member does not hold another entitlement certificate and the member has completed six months effective full&hyphen;time service after completion of the qualifying period. The entitlement certificate is then valid for 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The entitlement certificate makes the member eligible for the payment of subsidy of a loan made by the National Australia Bank in accordance with the agreement between it and the Commonwealth. The grant of the loan is subject to normal bank lending criteria. Once the loan has been approved by the bank and the amount of the loan has been advanced, the member is eligible for the payment of a loan interest subsidy by the Commonwealth for crediting the member's loan account, provided the member meets the criteria. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main features, as has been adequately outlined by all people who have spoken to the bill, are that we are reducing the eligibility period from six years to five years, that we are raising the maximum amount from $40,000 to $80,000&mdash;I would point out that people who already have the $40,000 loan are eligible to top it up&mdash;and that the scheme is then extended to certain members of the defence reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to your specific amendment&mdash;again, this is legal advice for you so that you will be able to withdraw your amendment; it is the opinion of the Assistant Secretary of the Legal Services Branch so that you will have it there for you to understand&mdash;because of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these requirements, an earlier date of commencement for the amendments would make no practical effect to the point at which benefits become payable under the scheme or the amount of the benefits. Approval for the enhanced benefits cannot be given until the amendments have been made, even if an earlier date of commencement is included, as you would wish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To qualify for the enhanced benefits, as for the existing benefits, an eligible member must meet the requirements set out in the act&mdash;that is, obtain an entitlement certificate, apply for the loan, obtain the approval and fully comply with the specified criteria. Those processes by their very nature can only operate on a prospective basis. Retrospective commencement of the amendments would not alter this fact. A member can only become eligible for benefits under the scheme when the processes have been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example will serve to illustrate this position. A member who has an existing subsidy entitlement of $40,000 will become eligible after commencement of the amendments for the increase to $80,000. However, to qualify for the additional subsidy the member must apply for approval for the increase under section 14 of the act, obtain approval of the application under section 15 and meet the lending criteria of the bank for the higher amount. These requirements can be met only after the amendments to the act have been made, that is, after royal assent. Even if the amendments are expressed to commence at an earlier date, no subsidy payment can be made on the higher amount until approval has been given and the eligibility criteria have been met. The increased subsidy cannot be paid for any period prior to the completion of this process which is set out in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar analysis can be applied to other amendments included in the bill. For example, even if the amendments relating to reserve members were expressed to commence from a retrospective date, no entitlement could be created until the processes set out above have been completed. The subsidy would be payable on a prospective basis only from the completion of all the eligibility requirements which must be of necessity after royal assent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3360">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the words of Assistant Secretary Brown of the Legal Services Branch:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These comments are based on the form of the proposed amendment which has been circulated. I have considered whether a different form of application provision could be constructed so as to provide for the enhanced benefits prior to royal assent. In my view this is not possible. For example, it would not be feasible to deem eligibility for the enhancement benefits to have been established as at some date earlier than royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion: In summary no practical benefit would flow from making the amendments to the bill commence on a retrospective basis.</PARA>
<PARA>For that reason I would suggest to the opposition that they might like to withdraw their amendments. If they choose not to, we will not be accepting the amendments for the reasons set out in this advice which I trust you will find useful. I table that minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was one other point that was raised that I would like to deal with. In his speech during the second reading debate the shadow minister said that we had known long in advance that we would not be meeting the 1 July date which, as I pointed out to him, was only a matter of getting through the vast amount of legislation that had to go through the cabinet. The fact of the matter is that he tried to bolster this by saying that the estimates of take&hyphen;up rate which are in the explanatory memorandum were evidence of this. That was clearly not so and is not so. It is simply a cumulative effect of the take&hyphen;up rate that is anticipated. The figure of $5.7 million for this current year was estimated on a full year and not part of a year. All along the line it was my intention from day one to meet that date. It was simply a matter of physically getting the amount of material that had to be dealt with through the cabinet which only enabled me to bring the bill in on 26 June. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that situation prevails. Of course, it does leave the remaining political difficulty that I think the government is in. That is, whilst that may well be the position in respect of the way the bill operates&mdash;I am happy to accept the advice and assurances that have been given by the minister&mdash;the politics with which this issue was conducted by the Liberal Party in the lead-up to the election were focused very much on this question of when the bill's passage occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign the Liberal Party courted the service vote by saying to the people in uniform, `We will provide you with better home loan subsidy access and we will do it sooner. You will get the benefit sooner.' That was predicated on a simple understanding of English that is, when someone says, as the Liberal Party policy quite clearly did, that it will take effect by 1 July rather than 1 January, like the Labor Party was going to do, then it actually has some import. It actually meant that a benefit in real terms would accrue to them if they voted Liberal because they would get this benefit and it would apply to them sooner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The technical requirements and the information just provided by the minister make plain that there is little, if any, significant advantage gained by passage of the bill in July or August or October. There may well be some delay that would inconvenience some people, but the very heart of the scheme, the very heart of the promise, which was to get people from $40,000 to $80,000, is still there and still available, notwithstanding that royal assent would be months later. Quite simply, in its election propaganda and in its effort to get the uniformed vote, the Liberal Party misled Australia in the way in which they put those propositions. I do not say that lightly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members will know, I have had some fairly extensive involvement with service personnel for some years. They, I must say like I, interpreted the words in their simple English meaning&mdash;that they meant what they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said. It may well be that at the time the Liberal Party actually believed that, too. It may be that the Liberal Party believed that they meant what they said and discovered that they could not do it. I am concerned that that interpretation was widely put across the community and up until now is still widely understood amongst people in uniform to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred yesterday to some letters to the editor that dealt with this matter. I think they are worth referring to again. I referred to a letter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 19 May from the minister in which she repeated the undertakings of the Liberal Party platform, without the date of operation. I think I now understand why that was so, given that she was informed before she wrote that letter that the 1 July date could not be complied with and, in any event, would not have the effect that certainly most people thought it would&mdash;and, I imagine, that she and her colleagues thought it might have. That, unfortunately, was not the interpretation of people who have an interest in this matter in the wider public. Indeed, the letter the minister wrote to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 19 May was the subject of a further letter from the person who had prompted the minister's letter, Mr Wayne Pocock, who wrote on 28 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps it has slipped Bronwyn's memory, but the coalition made political mileage out of the claim that it would increase the loan from 1 July 1996 and not 1 January 1997 as promised by Labor.</PARA>

No. The fact of the matter is that we said we would bring it down from six years to five years to make more people eligible more quickly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have gone around the various bases, as I make it my business to do, to meet with and hear the concerns of our serving defence personnel and I answer questions about this issue, the questions they are concerned with are: is the matter being acted upon; has the legislation been introduced; and can we expect the $80,000 to be made available to us? I answer them yes and I answer them quite truthfully. I tell them that I introduced the legislation into the House on 26 June and I tell them that I believe the opposition will support the legislation because they think it is good for personnel as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment (International Tax Agreements) Bill seeks to provide the legal authority for an international taxation agreement between the province of Taiwan and the nation state of Australia which was signed on 29 May 1996. The agreement is along the lines of the 36 other agreements currently in force with other countries. The purpose of concluding such agreements is to improve trade and investment flows by agreeing which nation has the rights to tax certain types of income. In this manner the threat of punitive double taxation is overcome. In office, Labor presided over a major expansion in the number of agreements entered into. This agreement is consistent with that process and as such will be supported by the federal parliamentary Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the matter relates to taxation arrangements for business transactions, we do raise our concern about government policy for the export of uranium to the province of Taiwan. It is a funny way to engage Asia&mdash;this government's aspiration&mdash;by exporting uranium to Taiwan knowing this will actively antagonise not only the fastest growing market that Australia has in the region, the People's Republic of China, but also a market where government to government relations impact heavily and crucially on trade and investment flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has concerns about the whole manner in which the Minister for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3364"> Foreign Affairs, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), is discharging his responsibilities. Before the election, we said that one thing that could be guaranteed about the member for Mayo and also the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) is that if they took on responsibilities for running Australia's diplomacy they would be noticed in the region. They have been noticed, but in the worst possible way: noticed for incompetency, noticed for mishandling issue after issue, noticed for dragging down Australia's international relations in Asia and noticed for dragging down Australia's trade and investment prospects. Inasmuch as this legislation will cover any attempt by the government to export uranium to Taiwan, those concerns need to be placed on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am assured, though, on our side of the House that the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) has researched this matter thoroughly. In her usual effective and confident style she will be addressing those matters in much greater detail throughout the second reading debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am rather surprised that the government's listed speaker&mdash;the Chief Government Whip&mdash;is not here to even reply to the Taxation Laws Amendment (International Tax Agreements) Bill which is now before the parliament. As my honourable colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has stated, I did express a desire to speak on the bill. I welcome the debate because of what we are doing with our international agreements and how we are going to take certain steps and because it gives me an opportunity to publicly support Taiwan and certainly the continuing close relationship that Australia enjoys with that island. It also provides me with a perfect opportunity to bring to the notice of this House&mdash;if it is not already there&mdash;the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), and particularly the government are supporting the sale of uranium to Taiwan despite understanding the ramifications of such a deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the diplomatic tightrope that any state has had to walk in building a healthy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relationship with Taiwan, I am glad to say that Australia has been extremely successful in this regard. In 1995 Taiwan was Australia's fifth most important trading partner in Asia and is surpassed only by Japan, South Korea, China and Singapore. Overall, Taiwan provided our sixth largest export market in 1995 with something like $3.3 billion worth of Australian exports finding their way to Taipei. Although the trade balance between our two countries is in our favour at the moment, it is not a one&hyphen;way street. Imports from Taiwan were worth about $2.6 billion in 1995. I am trying to be very frank and honest in what we are facing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all areas our links continue to strengthen and to grow. Tourism from Taiwan has grown rapidly since 1990. Air links between our two countries&mdash;first opened in 1991&mdash;increased some 47 per cent to March 1993. Student numbers from Taiwan increased by over 100 per cent between 1990 and 1995 when it became the seventh largest source market for students visiting Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two memorandums of understanding have now been signed between the office representing Australian interests in Taiwan, the Australian Commerce and Industry Office, and the Taiwanese authorities. A number of other agreements are already in the pipeline.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our relationship with Taiwan both economically and diplomatically is strong and the bill before the House is indicative of that. But it has now been tainted by the machinations of the foreign minister who, despite all the warning signs, despite knowing the damage that it would do to our reputation both on an international and a regional level, seems determined to go ahead with his foolhardy scheme to try to sell uranium to Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was revealed as late as last Friday that our foreign minister felt `very positive'&mdash;his words&mdash;about uranium sales to Taiwan and that he had directed his department to enter into negotiations to formalise arrangements for the sale. Indeed, it was revealed that, as far back as May this year, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were telling Australian uranium producers that Australia is actively exploring arrangements to allow the supply of Australian uranium to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3365"> Taiwan. Never mind the great damage it would do to our relationship with China. Never mind that Taiwan is not a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency or the fact that it is not a signatory to the nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation treaty. Never mind that it would contravene  Australia's signing of the South Pacific nuclear&hyphen;free zone treaty. The foreign minister's great idea, his grand Machiavellian scheme, was that he would get around all that by using a convenient `middleman'&mdash;the United States&mdash;to sell that uranium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia would get off, he thinks, scot free and the government would laugh all the way to the bank. What deceit! The foreign minister is basically saying to the people of Australia, `We don't care about our international obligations. They aren't worth the paper they are written on. Nor do we care about China. What we want is money for our uranium and we are going to get it any way we can.' Not only that, it is just another sign of how this government defines itself by its relationship with the United States. I am just waiting, as I am sure are many other colleagues on this side of the House, for the very first time that Uncle Sam says to them, `Jump!' and we hear our foreign minister say with a very high squeak, `How high?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is how we have arrived at the present situation, and that is just a very brief potted history&mdash;albeit without including an account of the recent record of the member for Mayo&mdash;a history I am sure I do not have to revisit at length for the benefit of honourable members. He is a figure of ridicule in this House, lampooned by the country's political cartoonists. He is an embarrassment to the nation at large. His political career lies in tatters and rags due to his handling of the DIFF scheme debacle. We have seen it all over the papers on where we now stand as a country because of the foreign minister's handling of just that one little thing. Despite his track record and despite his obvious failure to perform, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) continues to inflict him upon not only us but also our neighbours and our trading partners&mdash;a matter of no small cause for concern.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His handling of the question of exporting uranium to Taiwan is just another chapter in his very sorry history. The fact that he has allowed it to rear its ugly head just days after mouthing off about the importance of eliminating nuclear weapons and just days before he was to jet off to meet senior members of the Chinese government, including Premier Li Peng, is indicative of how politically immature and naive and how out of his depth he really is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, and perhaps this is more disappointing, this sorry episode displays not only the foreign minister's political ineptitude but also his true commitment to the cause of nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation&mdash;he has none. The foreign minister now stands revealed as a farcical and superficial politician of the highest order. He said in December 1995 that the Canberra Commission was `nothing more than a political stunt'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I understand the parliamentary secretary&mdash;and I am sure the chair&mdash;is rather concerned about some of the remarks being expressed in the House today, but I am well aware of what the debate is about. The debate is about an international agreement that has to be brought in so we can actually have a taxation arrangement with Taiwan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we have to go as a government to that step, I am also bringing to mind some of the comments and the statements that have been made by the political leaders of this country when they are trying not only to master their portfolios but also to take what we believe are massive steps of sending Australia down the tube. I am trying, through the vehicle that this debate provides to me in this House, to bring some of these things to the point, because I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3366"> believe they have to be stated. We can state them clause by clause on this very limited bill, but this bill is also about the international relationship that has to be acknowledged&mdash;that Taiwan is not a country and that we are still acknowledging it as part of mainland China. I am saying that, if we are going to do that with one hand&mdash;knowing full well that this bill is here for debate today and knowing full well that the foreign minister was aware of it and knowing full well and understanding and appreciating what could be involved if we were to take these other steps as far as trying to sell uranium through the United States back to Taiwan&mdash;then I believe these concerns must be brought up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While acknowledging that it does upset and concern the parliamentary secretary and the government, I still believe it has to be said. I represent the people as well. I believe&mdash;on behalf of the constituents I represent, the people of Australia&mdash;this knowledge has to be brought forward. If we are going to shove it under the carpet, we are going to see a lot more of this. We cannot have it going on ad infinitum. We cannot have mistake after mistake being made by our foreign minister so that Australia becomes the laughing, ridiculed country which you are now setting us up to be. We cannot have mistake after mistake knowing full well that briefings are being given by his department as to how situations should be handled while, at the same time, a bill like this was already introduced into the House before these comments were made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go back to the bill now. I am very pleased to say that there was a bit of a change of heart during this debate, particularly when discussion was being made on where we are going to go as far as the taxation agreement is concerned. The government is now saying about that particular commission of inquiry on uranium that it is `delighted' with the findings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe some of the blueprints that have been put into place by the present government&mdash;not only through this bill, because this bill does not affect those areas, but particularly with the uranium sales to Taiwan&mdash;display this government's true colours on all nuclear <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issues. We have to bring in legislation to deal with the country and taxation, but at the same time we must also bring in comments that are going to bring to the forefront of the Australian population where the government stands on most important issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I, while researching last night, decided I would go one step further. That is why I believe that the foreign minister of this country not only is upset about what he has done and said and what he has been found out to do, but also wants Australia&mdash;certainly the government does&mdash;to feel that they have turned over some new leaf, that the worm comes out of the apple at the other side looking all rosy. That is not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen case after case since the government took those benches in this parliament, from the statements that have been made, of exactly where they stand. What we have seen is sheer political hypocrisy. We have seen the very sleazy way in which it can deal underhandedly, particularly as the foreign minister has a mind to do, while setting up any other deals with countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a particular concern, and I can certainly understand that Australians may want to ask: is it really a problem for us to sell uranium to Taiwan? I will come back to it through this bill, because we are dealing with Taiwan. They may say that it is a very close and trusted ally of Australia. They may say that we enjoy a very strong and thriving trading partnership. Certainly we can trust them with our uranium not to use it for non-energy related purposes. I agree with that, and I would suggest that this is not the issue. It is not the issue at all. Of course Australia trusts Taiwan and vice versa; this bill before the House is indicative of that trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are issues bigger than trust at stake here. It is what trading uranium means to our relationship with other nations in the region, and that is why I am going to keep on repeating it. Where do we go from there, particularly with China? The issue is how such a deal would compromise our international treaty obligations. It is about how we have a foreign minister who, although recognising the gravity of the situation, has still continued to push <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3367"> this very dangerous deal via very underhand and very devious means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia trusts Taiwan, but by selling uranium to Taipei we would be destroying far more important international relationships than the one that this bill before the House seeks to cement and improve. Our relationship with the People's Republic of China has already been inflamed since the coalition took the power as government on 2 March. Now is not the time, nor is it the place, to discuss China's deep dissatisfaction and disappointment in this government. Of course, I am referring to the DIFF scheme. Suffice it to say, I am sure that our foreign minister's itinerary to China includes plenty of time for our minister to soothe frayed nerves in China and certainly get us out of troubled waters.</PARA>

It still very clearly says that it is an international taxing arrangement with Taiwan. I will ask the parliamentary secretary at the table: why do we have to have legislation like this before the House? Did we have to have legislation like this if they were an accepted, reputable trading partner or do we have to now put in special agreements at an international level?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As we are dealing with Taiwan, I think you will clearly see, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it provides me with the opportunity to say that we have other concerns with Taiwan, particu larly with the action that this government is taking in trying to implement sales of uranium to that particular country through a back door.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry if this offends the government. I am so sorry if they are so sensitive to some of the remarks I have made, which are so truthfully covered by any media, if they care to read it, and certainly by any ambassador of some of our trading nations, if they care to take the time to talk to them. If this is offensive to this parliament, I would like to know whether we are now going to go to the next stage of debate in this House and we do not bring down budgets like we were dictated to last night, but we are now going to stifle debate if anyone on the opposition benches has a contrary view to that of the government. The government of this parliament may have the numbers, but in a democracy it is we in the opposition who also have the opportunity to get up here and represent those people of Australia to make sure that we bring their concerns to the parliament and through the parliament back to the people of what is going on and what the foreign minister has been doing in this particular instance. There are a few others who have been doing a bit more, and I know that I will have opportunities to debate and discuss this when we consider other bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we have an opportunity to bring some honesty and truthfulness into the debate and, most importantly, to ask the government whether they have the integrity to stand up and take a little bit of criticism or are they now so thin&hyphen;skinned and offended by some of the truthful remarks I have made because of the inept way in which the foreign minister is handling his portfolio? I have not called for his resignation at this stage because I believe that, if he continues in the way he is going, the people of Australia will do it for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying&mdash;mindful of the bill before the House&mdash;is that I believe in opposition. We have a right to present the facts to this parliament. If the government wants to use their numbers and stifle me in debate, I will get up at other opportunities and I will continue to exercise my right as an elected representative in this parliament to speak on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3368"> matters before the parliament in the way that I believe they should be brought forward. I would never do it unless the bill appertaining to the particular debate was meaningful in some way. I believe that it is very meaningful to bring forward to this House, as I am outlining in the comments I have made, the problems that this foreign minister has got us into from some of the inept ways in which he is trying to do his job. I continue to do that because this bill before the House really signifies why debate like this should take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter whether we have goodwill or not towards Taiwan and it does not matter how much we put our trust into this government or how much we put our trust into our uranium going to China for peaceful and energy related uses. We do not have that luxury. No such luxury exists. This is the difference we seem to be having. We do not have to have this type of tax arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are times when we as a nation have to consider the wishes and the concerns of other countries in our international dealings. I believe this is one of those occasions and it is very important that we do it. That is why I will continue to say that the sensible answer to any sale of uranium to Taiwan, even for a non-peaceful purpose or peaceful purposes, must be no. But there is `sensible' as defined by the average person in the street and `sensible' as now defined by our foreign minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From our perception, what the people out there are saying and what our foreign minister is saying are two different things. On top of all of that, this bill in the House has had very limited access to debate. I am well aware of that because the parliamentary secretary is jumping up again because he feels that he will be offended, even though he does not know what I am going to say next. When I see them so agitated and becoming so grievous that in my 20-minute speech they have to jump up twice to take two points of order, obviously what I am saying must be affecting them. I have news for the parliamentary secretary and I have news for his government. I will continue to say things in this House that may affect you.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to quote very clearly from a confidential departmental memo which was prepared for the foreign minister on this very issue. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The timing makes it quite possible that China would view a move by Australia to initiate uranium exports to Taiwan in an unfavourable light and politicise any step we might take.</PARA>
<PARA>The memo continues by saying that China could make a connection between recent comments by the Taiwanese President, denying his country's intentions to resume its development of nuclear weapons with Australia's decision to export uranium to that island. For such a connection to be made, it would affect all of us concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only Australia's relationship with China that I am concerned about. That does stand threatened by this government's determination to keep on with that particular harebrained idea of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am concerned about the fact that, if such a deal were put together and structured, it would really show a sleight of hand and it would betray our international obligations. I will continue to repeat that because it would. Most particularly, it would do more than that; it would blacken Australia's name forever. Our nation's word would then be mud, and our international and regional standing will remain nothing in the eyes of our neighbours and our international partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nuclear non-proliferation treaty provides that all non-nuclear weapons states party to the treaty undertake to accept safeguards imposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency on all source materials in all peaceful nuclear activities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We could have taken point of order after point of order on you, and in future we will. Every time the member strays off the subject of a bill, every time she moves outside standing orders, we will move in on the member because her record of taking points of order rather than accepting points of order is quite marked. As a member, you are willing to take points of order but not to accept them. I think fairness should apply to debates as well as to our foreign relationships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The foreign relationship that we are talking about today is an agreement between the Australian Commerce and Industry Office and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office concerning the avoidance of double taxation&mdash;the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. The people who are going to be affected by this legislation are those who are currently residents of either Australia or Taiwan and who derive income profits and gains from the other territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This agreement has been a long time coming but is an agreement that has been welcomed by both sides. Certainly, the relationship between Australia and Taipei is a strengthening and growing relationship. The current government has expressed a great deal of support for the growing democratic processes in Taiwan, something that seems to be ignored by members on the other side who are more interested in the great march in the Chinese mainland than in the freedoms and struggles that have set up Taiwan as an amazing country which has made great advances in production, democracy and freedom. That is something that the members of the Australia Labor Party tend to ignore and it was ignored by the Labor Party in office. They were always seeking to favour mainland China rather than Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the bill before the House, this is typical of the Australian government's attitude towards the need to have established relationships with countries in our region that are important to us. I note the comments made by Mr David Hong, Director of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3370"> Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, when he visited the House of Representatives. Mr Hong said that he understood that more than 100 members of parliament are members of the Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time he made remarks encouraging a greater interest in and a greater bilateral relationship between the two nations. He made some very complimentary remarks about the current government and the processes adopted by the current government. He went on to say that our economies are complementary&mdash;that the flow and balance of trade is in Australia's favour by about $600 million, but the total volume of trade is about $4.3 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very significant trade relationship. Therefore, those trade relationships which did result in increased business between two significant countries must be matched with a taxation agreement that fairly affects both nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are changes to subsection 11(zf)(ii) which provide that particular income profits and gains under the agreement may be taxed by Australia in the hands of a Taiwan resident, and then, alternatively, those of an Australian in Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are further amendments which provide in the agreement for each territory to tax ongoing interest and royalties at a limited rate. It also allows the commissioner to amend assessments to give effect to the retrospective operation of article 8&mdash;ships and aircraft&mdash;to the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will take place shortly. The amendments effected by the bill will commence on the date of the royal assent. The agreement enters into force in Australia for withholding tax, income tax, profits or gains derived on or after the first day of the second month following that which the agreement enters into effect. For other Australian taxes covered by the agreement, but generally in respect of income tax, profits or gains for any year of income, they will begin on or after 1 July in the calendar year following that which the agreement enters into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is a changing relationship, one that is reflected in many countries, and one that is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very well due. There are many residents within Australia from Taiwan and they have established thriving businesses. The relationship between Australia and this free country is one that should be fostered and encouraged. It is not one that should enjoy the denigration that it has just received from the member for Prospect, who seeks to score political points rather than putting it in the serious context of a growing relationship and an important trade relationship at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two areas have had a particular growth in education and tourism. It is interesting to note that in 1988 there were only 302 Taiwanese students in Australia. By 1995 the figure had jumped to 3,924&mdash;a great increase of 1,300 per cent. In the comparatively short period of eight years, there has been an increase of 1,300 per cent in the number of students involved in Australian study and Australian universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that the then minister for education, Mr Koo, led a Taiwanese delegation of more than 60 experts to the first bilateral Taiwanese&hyphen;Australian Conference on Vocational Education and Training, held in Melbourne this May, so at a governmental level there is an increased relationship and an increased interest in the exchange of educational opportunities. This exchange in educational opportunities is also a growing area, because many of the educational opportunities provided for people from the Asian area are in private businesses. There is a need for an understanding of what the tax regime is going to be. In the tourist trade there is also the same need. In tourism alone 21,000 Taiwanese visited Australia in 1989 and the forecast for this year is 179,000. This is an increase of 850 per cent. Visitors' numbers are expected by the year 2003 to reach 380,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That volume of exchange is something that really does indicate that a strengthening of formalities and formal links, such as an international tax agreement, is a very significant process. I am delighted that the government has moved ahead with this legislation. It seems sensible and in line with other agreements established between Australia and other countries and territories. There seems <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3371"> nothing exceptional about it and I am pleased at that. I do not think we should be making a distinction between Taiwan and any other country. Taiwan has an active, virile, vigorous economy. It is an open democracy now, and is a place where Australia should have continuing, expanding relationships.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment (International Tax Agreements) Bill 1996 was introduced on 27 June 1996. It sets out to enhance Australian business opportunities in the Republic of China, which country will be described as `Taiwan' in subsequent remarks, by providing a more agreeable tax environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement was negotiated by, on Australia's behalf, the Australian Commerce and Industry Office or ACIO&mdash;which is Australia's de facto embassy in Taiwan&mdash;with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, TECO, which is ACIO's counterpart in Australia. The agreement was signed on 29 May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It binds any taxpayer who is a resident of either Australia or Taiwan and who acquires income, gains or profits from the other's territory. This bill will amend the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953, and seeks to prevent double taxation and tax evasion on the various forms of income flows between the two countries. In that, the agreement is quite similar to the agreements with the government of the Czech republic and, indeed, the government of Spain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were recently reminded in this House that Taiwan is currently our sixth biggest export market and Australia's ninth largest trading partner. In 1995, two&hyphen;way trade totalled close to $6 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Double taxation agreements are supported in principle by Australian tax experts, who acknowledge that such agreements are an integral part of the internationalisation of Australia's economy. I support the bill because it improves the investment prospects for Australian enterprises in Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also very interesting for its political implications, as previous speakers have already inferred. Although it is a bilateral agreement between Australia and Taiwan, our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government formally recognises Taiwan as a province of China and recognises that the People's Republic of China&mdash;not the Republic of China&mdash;is the sole government of China and, therefore, of Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government has tried concertedly to ensure that this agreement does not imply a recognition of Taiwan's sovereignty. However, the reality is that Taiwan's sovereignty is recognised. That is the reality. With Taiwan warranting a separate tax agreement, this is an acceptance of independent jurisdiction and, by extension, independent sovereignty. The very fact that the ACIO and TECO organisations exist and operate as de facto embassies, and even negotiate international agreements on behalf of their respective governments, gives substance to the fact that Australia, in reality, does recognise the legitimacy of the Taiwan government, but does so only covertly so as not to upset the people's republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of the international status of Taiwan has been one of intense interest since 1973 when Australia recognised the People's Republic of China, referred to briefly as China, as the official government of all China, including Taiwan. This recognition of China as the sole representative of the Chinese people on the mainland and Taiwan was also undertaken by most other Western nations in the 1970s. The United States of America did that in 1979. It was a long&hyphen;term patron of Taiwan until then and was one of the last in that decade of the 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whereas in the Cold War most nations recognised two Germanies and two Koreas, such dual recognition has never been applied to China. This was probably because until recently both governments continued to claim they were the official government for the whole of China. As such, the Republic of China was the recognised government of China for many years, just as the communist People's Republic is now the recognised government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3372"> This policy position is described, as I am sure you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the One China policy. It is a policy position most governments have been at pains to maintain, if only at a superficial level. It is a question able piece of foreign policy which recognises only one China to the exclusion of the other. Both deserve to be represented in international forums and both should have fully fledged diplomatic relations with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's long&hyphen;term economic relations with East Asia would be greatly enhanced if we were able to develop closer economic ties with both Chinas. This would especially be the case if the mainland Chinese economy were to continue its current rapid rate of economic growth and Taiwan were to spend, as projected, billions of dollars on major infrastructure projects. However, it should be said that economic factors should not necessarily be the key criteria determining Australia's relationships with China or Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another factor of some importance is the development of democratic processes in both Chinas, and the adherence of those countries to basic human rights. To date, Taiwan has moved, and continues to move, toward a pluralistic democratic state with human rights being given ever greater prominence. It is unjust to deny recognition of a state which has made tremendous progress in basic democratic and human rights over the past decade. Mainland China's human rights record is, of course, less than good&mdash;and that is something of an understatement. From the takeover and oppression immediately after 1949, the cultural revolution, the Tiananmen Square massacre and butchery in Tibet, the Chinese government has shown nothing but a flagrant disregard for some of the most basic of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While on the issue, I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), for planning to meet with the Dalai Lama in spite of China's objections. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) should also seriously consider meeting the Dalai Lama to express his empathy with him and the Tibetan people as they campaign for human rights and sovereignty in Tibet. It is unfortunate that the Chinese communists are so adamant in their opposition to official recognition of both Chinas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate to digress to note that members of the parliamentary group supporting Amnesty International are promoting a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> demonstration outside the Chinese embassy in Canberra on 15 September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past couple of weeks there has been a visit to Taiwan by a senior official from Fujian, which is the province across the Taiwan straits within artillery range of the Taiwanese islands of Xiamen and Quemoy. The head of the Shanghai stock exchange, accompanied by bankers and other financial experts, has been there in the last week or two. Mr Yin Wenlong, President of Air China, China's government owned national airline, and various experts on ports have been among recent visitors. In some sort of reciprocal arrangement China has allowed some 50 Taiwan academics to attend a seminar on cross&hyphen;strait cultural and economic relations, also in the past week or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of those events it is a passing strange double standard adopted by the People's Republic and its embassy here to criticise the present government over the projected visit by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) to Taiwan. That is even more remarkable because it is only a year or two since then Senator McMullan as Minister for Trade visited Taiwan with scarcely a whimper from the embassy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an unappealing situation which Australia faces in that we can either recognise the People's Republic with its totalitarian regime to the exclusion of Taiwan or we can recognise Taiwan with its democratic market based society and population of 20 million to the exclusion of the mainland where, of course, there is a population in the vicinity of 1.1 billion people. Of course, due to China's opposition to dual recognition, any attempt to further formalise relations with Taiwan could result in Australian firms being given short shrift in China along with a downgrading, no doubt, of our diplomatic relationships. That is to be avoided but not at the expense of kowtowing to the Beijing regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date we have managed to maintain official relationships with China without totally isolating Taiwan. The question remains: are these unofficial links satisfactory? Obviously there is no definitive solution to that question. Australia considered China to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3373"> be the more important market until 1983, when Taiwan became its seventh largest export market, surpassing China, then being relegated to ninth position. Since then Australia has been forced to take note of the massive economic growth achieved by Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must be able to take part in the commercial opportunities in Taiwan so that we can partake of the obvious benefits it confers on both our economy and Australian businesses. Australia's trade relations with Taiwan to date are very strong. Australia treats Taiwan on a par with all the other signatories to APEC, yet out of respect to China, and a desire to maintain the status quo, relations are officially `unofficial'&mdash;a contradiction in terms if ever there was one. Relations have been driven by markets and fear; recognition of obvious trade advantages and fear of Chinese reprisals for actively dealing with Taiwan. So far China has not objected to Australia's more recent policy of two Chinas thinly disguised as a One China policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1990 a report by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recommended that Australia establish closer ties with Taiwan. This was followed up with an expansion in unofficial dealings. Direct air services have been established between the two countries, facilitating travel as well as streamlining the visa system for visitors. Australia formally recognised Taiwanese investment in Australia by enacting legislation to protect the right to invest by Taiwanese. In 1992 Taiwanese officials in Canberra were permitted to open the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, a diplomatic privilege normally accorded only to embassies and missions. In Taipei the Australian Chamber of Commerce was just one of many business organisations invited to set up headquarters on Taiwanese soil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to trade, Australia is only too aware of China's reliance on world markets for raw materials. However, so far the USA has enjoyed a privileged position in that trade. In order to diversify and capture other market niches in Taiwan, Australia is seeking to expand into exporting educational and transport services, manufactured goods and equipment for power generation, environmental <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> technology, aviation and telecommunications plus raw wool, woollen products and processed foods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imports from Taiwan consist, almost exclusively, of manufactured goods, 26 per cent of which are computer products. Other items include office and industrial machinery, plastic goods, toys and games, sporting goods, textiles, chemicals, nails, screws, bolts, hand tools, electrical appliances and metal manufactures. Figures for 1993 show that Taiwan enjoyed a minimal trade surplus with Australia. However, this could be reversed if Australia could secure contracts for some of the US$40 billion Taiwanese government initiatives to radically upgrade their national infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also of note are predictions of a flourishing tourist trade, with estimates that Taiwanese tourists to Australia will number around 315,000 in 2000.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As attractive as these opportunities appear for Australia, the politics of trade cannot be ignored. For both Australia and Taiwan, the objective of closer links is, undoubtedly, commercial, but from the Taiwanese perspective visits from Australian ministers, such as those of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, to Taiwan and earlier meetings with ministers amount to effective Australian <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3374"> recognition of, and potential support for, Taiwan's independent status. There is, indisputably, plenty of scope for mutual benefit through trade agreements, and through taxation agreements such as this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it would be naive of Australia to ignore the Taiwanese imperative to gain relatively independent status. Of course, the reality is that once Taiwan gains membership of the international organisations it seeks to join it will be compelled, through financial necessity and other binding agreements, such as those required by the World Trade Organisation, to eradicate any favoured nation trading agreements. That would have very important implications for taxation and this agreement. For these reasons, Australia must look realistically at the future of Taiwan and trade relationships with that country. In economic terms, Taiwan is more important to Australia than many of the ASEAN members because it is now Australia's third largest export market in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point has been made that Australia's exports, although significant, are largely anonymous in that they are not marketable brand names, and there is concern that Australia's terms of trade could deteriorate if we do not succeed in expanding our exports of conservation technology, education services, processed foods and tourism. Currently, the Australian Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei is attempting to push Australian consumer goods as well as opening up new services for Australian businesses there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately there are two positions that Australia can take on future relations with Taiwan, Mr Deputy Speaker. Either we can continue to follow the status quo of maintaining the former One China policy which recognises the two governments, albeit one of those tacitly, or we can go along with attempts towards recognising Taiwan as the independent nation it undoubtedly is. More recently it seems that the USA is beginning to acknowledge the de facto relationship between China and Taiwan and is, itself, moving slowly towards formal recognition of Taiwan's position. I suggest that Australia could very well tag along with&mdash;if not lead in the area, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but at worst tag along with&mdash;the United States in that objective. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (1.31 p.m.)&mdash;in reply&mdash;As we all know, the main thrust of the Taxation Laws Amendment (International Tax Agreements) Bill is to prevent double taxation with Taiwan and Australia. There has been a reasonably extensive discussion and debate on that; I do not want to extend that side of the debate any further. It is important that we have very good relationships with Taiwan. That is what it is about: trade. Taiwan is our ninth largest trading partner which is pretty important to Australia and it is also the sixth largest export market for Australia. It is very significant. The amount of trade between the two countries is around about $5.9 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to establish the right sort of framework for people to operate in regard to trade between these two countries in this region. This legislation will help to achieve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the debate, I do want to refer to some of the comments made by the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) in regard to uranium sales to Taiwan. I am fascinated by the fact that the member has now left. The member for Prospect came in here really just to make an attack on the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and, on the way through, to denigrate Taiwan as a country. That is a concern to us as a government. It is also a concern to us in regard to the sort of comments that were made. I question whether she is in the same party as the now shadow Treasurer and the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Gareth Evans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments which were made do not seem to be coming from the same party. Back in September 1993&mdash;and maybe some of the people who were in government then might like to listen now to what the previous Keating government's position was in regard to uranium and Taiwan&mdash;we had the DPIE and the ASO official visit to Taiwan. What did they go there for? They went to explore the possibility of concluding uranium sales to Taiwan following the announcement by Canada of sales to Taiwan. Under the former <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3375"> Labor government, we had officials go from this country to explore the possibility of uranium sales to Taiwan. Now we have the member for Prospect coming in here giving every indication that the Labor government had nothing to do with it. Now, as the Labor opposition, she says, `Oh goodness gracious me, how horrible,' for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to go over there or make comments that we might entertain the idea of uranium sales to Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 27 October 1993, we had Mr Evans in the Senate question time saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with our interests in exploring all avenues for increasing our bilateral trade, we are keeping under review the question of possible uranium sales to Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA>It shows there was, on 27 October 1993, a very clear position by this opposition to explore trade with Taiwan. Yet the member for Prospect comes in here today giving every indication they had nothing to do with it. It seems to me that there is a lot of division in the Labor Party on this issue.</PARA>

The member for Prospect raised this issue here on the floor of the House. I am responding and summing up on behalf of the government on this particular issue. It may be that offers were under way in this regard, but it was very clear just over 12 months ago that the previous government were indicating that they were trying to negotiate sales in regard to uranium and Taiwan. Maybe the opposition have changed their minds or maybe they are having a big debate amongst themselves as to whether the Left wants to export uranium, or the Right wants to export it&mdash;or maybe they do not have any policy at all on this issue&mdash;but to come in here and raise it on this particular issue I think was rather foolish of the member.</PARA></TALK.START>

It goes on and says there are a range of options. One is to leave things as they are, or you can take a middle course and actively take steps towards finalising draft arrangements for ministers who would subsequently review the package and decide whether or not to conclude the arrangements.

There was no plan. That is what he said four days ago&mdash;and yet here we have all the evidence in the records indicating that the former foreign affairs minister was directly involved in negotiating on behalf of the Keating government the possibility of sales to Taiwan. The shadow spokesman just four or five days ago is out there saying there was no plan to export it using the United States as a front to avoid our international obligations, when in actual fact that is exactly what the opposition when they were in government were doing. And not only was Mr Evans saying when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs that he was doing all this exploring of it but then a couple of days later Mr Brereton, the shadow minister for foreign affairs, says it was explored for a year or so.

<PARA>The opposition does not oppose the provisions in the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1), but we do oppose dishonesty in public life.

We oppose their breach of faith with the Australian people, based on their 1996&hyphen;97 budget. We oppose a Prime Minister who cannot lie straight in bed. We oppose a Prime Minister who, prior to the last election, made promises only to be broken. He made them only to be broken. We oppose tax fraud. This government's revenue collection measures in this budget&mdash;and this particular bill is one of them&mdash;represent wholesale tax fraud: that is, tax fraud across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, on these matters the Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins, Mr Costello has revealed himself to be much more a taxer than an axer. He has done a lot of axing in the budget but he has done a lot more taxing. He showed his form earlier this year, just prior to the Premiers Conference, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3377"> when he wanted to make a $1.5 billion tax grab.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premiers' opposition to the Treasurer's move derailed that particular plan but effectively, by announcing his big $1.5 billion tax grab, the Treasurer wrecked the first Premiers Conference of the Howard government. He effectively set back intergovernmental relations in this country for a number of years. He set back the cause of Commonwealth&hyphen;state relations by a decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was not deterred in his tax grabbing. He was not deterred in his tax fraud. He stood in the House last night, as part of the budget, and presented to the Australian people and the House of Representatives a $2 billion tax grab. Not deterred by his failure at the Premiers Conference to have a $1.5 billion tax grab in the budget, he is actually going for a $2 billion tax grab.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge government members, as they examine this budget and try to understand what the Treasurer has done, to move to page 1.19 of budget statement No. 1 and to examine the table on major revenue measures&mdash;the government policy decisions on revenue. They will notice that in 1996&hyphen;97 this government is giving $362 million in tax concessions, but it is taking away $1.3 billion&mdash;a net tax grab by this government, including this particular provision, of $1 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gets worse. In 1997&hyphen;98 they are giving, through their limited tax concessions for families, $568 million, but they are taking back $2.5 billion. Through the next two financial years that is a tax grab of $2 billion. With one hand they are handing out limited tax concessions and with the other they are grabbing back, mainly through bracket creep, mainly through their failure to index taxation brackets, $2 billion net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who parades himself through the Lyons Forum as representing family values on the government benches, should have a look at the major revenue measures of this government. What it is doing over the next two years effectively&mdash;</PARA>

This, of course, equates to $260 for every taxpayer in this country. Every taxpayer in the electorate of Wentworth, every taxpayer in the electorate of Braddon, on average, will be $260 worse off over the next two financial years as a result of this tax grab.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every taxpayer in the public galleries, every taxpayer who reads the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will know that in the fine print of this Costello budget, the major revenue measures, is a huge tax grab. In 1997&hyphen;98 this government is handing over half a billion dollars in limited tax concessions and then ripping back $2.5 billion. That is a net tax grab of $2 billion that every single taxpayer on average in this country will have to pay to the tune of $260. Of course, the measures in this bill are but a small part of that particular tax grab.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Income tax on individuals in the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year goes up by a whopping $5.5 billion. Where was the low taxing, small government member for Wentworth (Mr Andrew Thomson) when these things were going through the federal cabinet? It goes up by a whopping $5.5 billion. Tax collections from income tax payers in Australia, in real terms, discounting inflation, go up by 6&half; per cent in 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this comes from the hairy&hyphen;chested Peter Costello who, at his first press conference as Treasurer on 12 March, said that he was going to consolidate the budget on outlays. He said he was going to consolidate the budget on outlays as he beat his chest, trying to show that he was a hairy&hyphen;chested Treasurer. He was going to do the fiscal consolidation on outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He announced to the people of Australia that this was the end of the days of waste and sloth. What he really did, in this budget, was to start the days of taxing and tax fraud. He has shown himself to be much more a taxer than an axer. He has shown himself to be someone who is grabbing $2 billion net in tax <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3378"> out of the pockets of middle Australia over the next two financial years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, under this government, in the net tax measures that have been introduced there is all pain and no net gain. Working families across Australia will not be deceived by the promise of limited tax concessions, because they know that, through bracket creep and through the failure of this government to introduce tax indexation, the government is breaking its promises. It was the Treasurer&mdash;then simply the member for Higgins&mdash;who at the Press Club, just prior to the election, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not our agenda to introduce new taxes. It is not our agenda to bulk up currently existing taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>Bulk up? He is a tax hulk. He is turning green and breaking out of his suit, trying to grab that $2 billion from the taxpayers of Australia. This is an act of outright tax fraud. The PAYE taxpayers are paying it to a huge extent. It affects the Medicare levy and the corporations and the small businesses that are part of the $2 billion tax fraud of which this bill is but a small part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of person would break his promises so comprehensively? What sort of person would lie to the Australian people and deceive them so thoroughly on that particular tax promise? No new taxes and no tax increases: that is what he swore to the people of Australia before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just last Saturday, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, we had a pretty good insight into what sort of Treasurer Australia has got. I quote:</PARA>

This is a clear breach of an election promise to the states; the states, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in many cases, have had no choice but to increase their own taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have seen, in several states, the introduction of state Costello taxes. They have suffered a breach; they have been betrayed by the Howard government on their grants. To correct that&mdash;the Treasurer himself said it should be revenue neutral&mdash;they have taken the revenue neutrality to the point of having to introduce state Costello taxes, and who can blame them? Who can blame them when it was the Treasurer who so badly broke that promise? The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was part of it and yet this is the Prime Minister who before the election said that if he were given a choice between fiscal consolidation and having to break his promises, and of allowing the budget deficit to be larger but keep his promises, he would keep his promises. He said he would keep his promises to the states, local government, taxpayers, and every single Australian citizen at any cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate has got to the ludicrous point in public morality where you cannot even believe the Howard government's promise to keep its promises. They have reached a new low in morality in public life whereby we are supposed to be thankful for any promise they keep. If they keep a promise, we are supposed to applaud; if they do something that actually accords with what they promised the people of Australia, they are expecting everyone to be thankful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am afraid that this House should have a different standard. We should expect the Prime Minister to keep his promises. We should expect him to keep his promise to keep his promises. And that, of course, was very clear before the election. This is a budget of betrayal. This is a $2 billion net tax grab over the next two years, and it represents absolute betrayal to the people of Australia and this bill is part of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The promise was made to local government prior to the election to maintain their financial capacity, yet they will suffer financially as a product of this legislation. Local government has been betrayed by the Howard government. Not only the taxpayers who will suffer with the $2 billion net tax grab over the next two financial years; not only the states who have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3380"> had to introduce their state Costello taxes, not only have they been betrayed, but local government has been betrayed because they were promised that their financial capacity would be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those government members who are now entering the House after their assessment of the budget, and the Prime Minister, who is also coming in, should consult Budget Paper No. 1, turn to page 1.19 and examine the major revenue measures of this government, of which this bill is one. What they will find is that in the current financial year this government will, on the one hand, offer $362 million of tax concessions to Australian taxpayers and on the other rip back $1.3 billion. It will rip back $1.3 billion on its own revenue raising measures, in its own budget document. It is a $1 billion tax grab for 1996&hyphen;97 that converts to $2 billion for the following financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a high tax government. It is high tax Howard according to the budget documents. The Treasurer has shown that he is much more a taxer than an axer; he has done a lot of axing in the budget but much more taxing. This is a Treasurer who said before the election, joined by his Prime Minister, that he was going to make government smaller. How do you make government smaller by increasing tax as a proportion of GDP by 0.4 per cent? How do you make government smaller? How do you fulfil that election commitment to the people of Australia by making the tax revenues larger by almost half a per cent of GDP? This is a government which has, with these tax measures, including the sales tax provisions before the House, betrayed the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also betrayed local government with these particular measures by reducing their financial capacity; betrayed the states who have had, in many cases, no choice but to introduce their state Costello taxes; and betrayed the ordinary Australian taxpayer, who, on average, over the next two financial years will be $260 worse off as a product of the Treasurer's $2 billion tax grab. It is a budget of betrayal and, of course, according to this particular bill, a budget of massive disappointment for local government.</PARA>

The pace at which net debt levels, particularly in the Commonwealth government general sector, have been allowed to build up in recent years has been absolutely irresponsible. Commonwealth general government debt rose from around four per cent of GDP in 1989-90 to over 19 per cent in 1995-96. Labor had Australia on a debt path for good. This is a government which has come in and been prepared to do the hard yards. This is a government which has given an opportunity to young people in the future. Your government would have saddled them with debt, not just for the decade but into the next century. Labor was a party of financial mismanagement which was reducing future opportunities for young Australians, a party which had no concern for the people who are going to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3385"> future of this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is no, it does not. The judgment that ought to be made about any government in relation to unemployment, be it a Liberal government or a Labor government, is the judgment that is made after that government has been in for a period of time. That is the judgment that was made about you. One of the reasons why you of all people have no moral, intellectual or economic credibility in lecturing us about unemployment is that, after 13 years in government, you left this nation with an unemployment rate permanently stuck between eight or nine per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way there can be any change at all in the bleak outlook for unemployment in this country that we inherited from you is to bring about fundamental change in the labour market and the removal of the rigidities on the supply side of the Australian economy. Every day that you hold up industrial relations reform, you are striking a blow against the unemployed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has laid down in a quite impressive fashion the fiscal consolidation program. I cannot recall a budget in the last 10 to 15 years which has received a better response from the media, from commentators and from financial markets. I said in relation to the budget that, in terms of keeping commitments, we have seven or eight out of 10. I would say, in terms of economic responsibility, we have 9.99 out of 10. After that Standard and Poor's report, I think it may be entitled to a premium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I very seriously say to the Leader of the Opposition that of course unemployment remains the biggest single social challenge of any government in Australia. You had 13 years to fix the problem, and you failed to fix it. We have been in office for five months. We have attended to a fiscal mess that we inherited from you, we have fixed the budget mess that we inherited, and we have kept the essential commitments that we made on which we were elected. That is a pretty impressive performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a far better performance than the first Labor budget in 1983 when every single promise you made was junked. You made no attempt to keep any of them. You junked all of them within a matter of three or four weeks. That is how disreputable you really were. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if you want to make comparisons in relation to unemployment by all means you go ahead and do so, but remember that the Australian people know your form on unemployment&mdash;you have got a lot of it&mdash;and all of those people behind you have got a lot of form on unemployment.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. This budget is strongly a redistributive budget. This is a budget which delivers important tax relief to families, and it delivers it right down to the lowest income scale. This was an increase in the tax-free threshold to deliver the biggest benefits to those at the lowest end of the income scale. For example, a family with two children qualifying under part (a) and part (b) of the family tax initiative will receive $34 a fortnight. This is a benefit to families with children. It is a benefit to those who needed the help and were completely overlooked under 13 years of Labor administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not end there. For those older Australians that are on pensions, we have funded in the forward estimates&mdash;across the forward estimates&mdash;25 per cent of male average total wages. We have made sure that we have put that down there across the forward estimates to give them security in relation to their pensions. We have delivered to the self-funded retiree and those that have been paying tax at a higher threshold on the same income as those that are on pensions. We have given them tax justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have reduced the provisional uplift factor for small business to six per cent. Under Labor, small business paid tax on income it had not earned because there was an inflator. We are giving small business the opportunity to grow bigger in relation to our capital gains tax changes. This was the government that had the courage to make incentives for high income earners to take out private health insurance&mdash;not Labor.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw the Labor spokesman on Treasury matters saying last night, `We have been thinking about doing that.' They might have been thinking about it; they never had the courage to do it. It was only this side of the House that had the courage to do it. This is the government that will put in place the measures to capture tax from high wealth individuals. We heard the spokesman from the opposition saying last night, `We announced during the election campaign we'd do that.' After 13 years of government you announced in an election campaign that you were thinking of doing something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that had the courage, when it came into office, to attack these redistributive measures, to put aside $20 million to get a contribution from high income earners, to look at the tax concessions, to distribute to low income families and to give justice to small businesses and give them the opportunity to grow bigger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a reformist government. In the context of all of that, it took the mess it inherited and it will fix that too. It will not only do all of those things but also fix the mess that was left by 13 years of sloth and neglect. This is a reformist government. This is a government which is building for the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it entirely clear: putting numbers does not fix the problem and it does not change it, but I will tell you what it does change because we now know.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to say in response to the member for Moncrieff's question that one of the many key commitments of the coalition that was honoured in full in the budget last night was the commitment that we made to older Australians. As a section of the population, older Australians are major beneficiaries of last night's budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, we have delivered in full on our commitment to extend the pensioner tax rebate to self-funded retirees. That is going to be introduced in two stages and will be operating in full during the first three years of the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government. So that commitment, made by the coalition on a number of occasions during election campaigns, is going to be honoured in full. We will no longer discriminate within a particular age cohort of the population against one section of that population; we will treat them all equally under the Australian taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we have delivered on our commitment to maintain the real value of the age pension. The age pension will continue to be indexed twice yearly. For the first time ever, this government has built into its budget bottom line its commitment to maintain the pension at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. For part-time pensioners and self-funded retirees who pay provisional tax, we have reduced the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members of the House will know, many retired Australians on very small incomes still scrimp and save in order to take out private <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3388"> health insurance. One of the most remarkable things about the private health insurance debate when those in the Labor Party deride tax incentives for private health insurance as being handouts to the rich is they forget the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of retired Australians who regard the maintenance of private health insurance as an absolute necessity of life. They go without a lot of other things in order to take it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure that we announced last night is not a handout to the rich; it is a measure to give a small portion of taxation justice to retired Australians thrifty enough to provide for their own private health insurance. I am very proud to say that one of the great groups of beneficiaries of that private health insurance rebate will be retired Australians on modest incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be very interested to know whether the jaundice of the Leader of the Opposition towards the tax incentive for private health insurance extends to knocking off a benefit for retired Australians.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important question, and I want to say at the outset that we have taken a number of broad decisions which greatly help regional Australia. The first of these would be the decision, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> given the $7 billion reduction in outlays, to in fact increase local government financial assistance grants by some four per cent&mdash;that was against the flow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second would be the diesel fuel rebate decision, which provides a real benefit right across Australia in agriculture and mining, and that is one decision which stacks up. Small business and farmers, of course, will get the benefit of the eight per cent to six per cent reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor, which this crazy opposition chose to vote against at the end of the last session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I also say in the broad that the family tax initiatives are steps in the right direction to give a fair go to families in rural and regional Australia. Less pressure on interest rates flowing out of the macro settings of the best budget in 20 years will be a great help as well. There is a range of broad developments which are great for rural and regional Australia. My colleague Minister Moore and I went to Brisbane today, and I can tell the opposition and the House that the budget is selling well in Brisbane and beyond, and there is more to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the specifics, there is a range of initiatives which will be covered in more detail by my colleagues, including the minister for transport, but I will mention some of them. They include the reintroduction of the black spots road program&mdash;something you abolished. Something you could not find the money for, we are bringing back in. The restoration of $60 million of CSIRO funding is part of that equation. The woodchip decision, which you did not have the courage to face up to for year after year, is part of the package that this government has produced, and we will deliver further on regional forest agreements. The FBT is a good battlers from the bush decision.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first and most important thing that should be said about the government decisions that have had a beneficial impact on the regions of Australia is that the decision that this government took in relation to the woodchip industry has had a massively beneficial effect on many regional parts of Australia. I notice that the member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro is nodding; I also notice the member for Page and many other members from regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons why the regional areas of Australia left the Labor Party in droves at the last election is your complete betrayal of them in relation to the woodchip issue. You betrayed them very badly. What we did with the decision on the woodchip industry was to strike a proper balance between concerns for the environment and the recognition that once you destroy industry in some regional parts of Australia&mdash;once it has gone&mdash;it will never return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The path down which you were going in relation to the woodchip industry was a path that would have destroyed the livelihood of thousands of people in regional communities in Australia. Responses that I have had, not just from people in the industry but also from people in the trade union movement concerned with the woodchip industry, have been that they have applauded the balance of the decisions that have been taken by us.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The private health insurance incentives announced last night will do three things. First, they will stabilise the dropout of people from private health insurance. Secondly, they will provide very real relief, particularly to low income people and retired people, of which the honourable member for McPherson has a large number in his electorate. Thirdly, they will take pressure off the public hospital system. I will talk about these three in order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is stabilising the dropout from private health insurance. There was a very interesting article a week ago in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS> explaining why we do not have a stable private health insurance system and why people are dropping out. The article was entitled `Health fund members hit $850m'. Who hit them? You did. It goes into detail and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Between 1984 and 1988 the government phased out a $220 million program that helped fund the cost of members who spend long periods in hospital.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wiped out. It goes on:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In October 1986 it removed a private bed day subsidy paid when patients were in private hospitals, which today would be worth $235 million.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wiped out. It continues:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In 1987 the government cut the Medicare benefit of medical services provided to private patients from 85 per cent to 75 per cent. This forced the funds to pay the extra 10 per cent gap.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The article goes on to say:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Government cost shifting kickstarted a vicious circle for the funds where the rise in premiums caused younger, healthier members to drop out, triggering another rise in premiums, further loss, and so on.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">From budget night, with this announcement, that will come to an end and the level will be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3392"> stabilised. Secondly, these initiatives will provide very real relief to those who already have private health insurance. That is over a third of the population. That is around 700,000 people on incomes under $20,000 a year who at the moment are holding on to their private health insurance. This will make it easier for them to at least have that choice.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing these initiatives will do for health care delivery in Australia is provide very real assistance to the public hospital system. My department estimates that if two per cent of people drop out of private health insurance it puts another 322,000 bed days of demand on the public hospital system. That is like having to have two public hospitals brim full for 365 days a year, just because of the people who have dropped out of private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, public hospitals will be able to charge the funds for a greater proportion of patients who are privately insured. We reckon this will bring about $20 million into the public hospitals that we will not seek to recover. Also, doctors will be able to charge Medicare rather than charge the state governments on a fee for service or sessional basis. We reckon this will cost us $15 million. We do not seek to claw any of that back. In the end, it will lead to a stable system that will give people choice.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was hoping you would ask this. The fact is: you clearly do not understand how public hospitals are funded. In my entire portfolio there were only two things that were saved from an efficiency dividend&mdash;research funding and public hospital funding. The fact is that on the four-year forward estimates public hospital funding is entirely untouched, not just the base grants of public hospital funding but case&hyphen;mix development, quality assurance, infrastructure planning, bonus pool, hospital access&mdash;they are all untouched.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are talking about is a rort. I would like to see you stand up here and defend a rort. I will explain the rort to you because clearly you don't understand it. Under the Medicare system that was presided over by you, states shifted costs onto the Commonwealth. They put patients with their pre&hyphen; and post&hyphen;operative radiology work&hyphen;ups out in the private. They privatised outpatient clinics so&hyphen;called and shifted costs onto the Commonwealth. They put Medicare bulkbilling agencies in hospital casualties&mdash;one that I have seen so-called specialising in plaster removals. This cost shifting was completely out of control. We estimate it is going to cost the Commonwealth $400 million a year. That is the rort you are defending. It is completely unjustified.</PARA>

If you take back a rort that states are not entitled to, that is not a cut; it is sensible policy that will make Medicare sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will look forward to you standing up here in the MPI and seeing if you can justify that rort.

After 13 years of being treated as second&hyphen;class citizens, small business will assume a pre-eminent role in the national economy under this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What honourable members opposite never understood is that it is not an economy driven by fabricated government programs; it is an economy driven by individuals and small companies. All you ever did was market programs. You would repackage, rebadge, refund and remarket programs all to no effect&mdash;One Nation, Working Nation and on and on. You have never understood small business, otherwise you would have tackled the government budget deficit a long time ago so as to bring down interest rates. Small business has borrowed $46 billion from the banks, so interest rates are critical to its capacity to reinvest, to grow, to make profits and to employ people. Your irresponsible fiscal policy crippled many small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have kept our election commitment in regard to the provisional tax uplift factor to reduce it to six per cent. That will inject $180 million into the small business sector. We have kept our election commitment to allow <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> small businesses to defer capital gains tax arising from the sale of their businesses. Your government refused to do this. Again, you have never understood the fact that the assets of a small business are often the only resources small businesses have to fund a new business or their own retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have stopped&mdash;and this has hardly received recognition publicly, let alone from that side&mdash;the very contentious tax law No. 5 which was introduced by the previous government. It would have changed the status of subcontractors creating a horrendous and expensive, not to mention time wasting, burden on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other initiatives in the budget last night which will support small businesses. Our industrial relations package will scrap the unfair dismissal provisions and establish a more flexible labour market. There are incentive payments targeted at small businesses to encourage them to take on apprentices and trainees. Our small business deregulation task force, which will report on 1 November, will set out for us how to improve our already impressive reduction in the paperwork burden on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is finally dawning on the Labor Party, after 13 years of destruction of small business, that they have to do something. We have today a report of a leaked document from Senator Peter Cook, shadow minister for commerce and small business. It was tabled at the Perth meeting a few weeks ago. He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. This is clearly a central part of the government's commitment to Australians. This is a good news budget for families. It is balanced and it is fair and, more importantly, it protects the vulnerable in our community. That was the commitment and that is what we have delivered. Our policies are equitable and they are sustainable both now and in the future. That is critical if we are to continue to deliver social policies that are vital to Australian families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget provides a range of issues particularly beneficial to families. Of course, the central part of that is the most comprehensive and the most significant tax package that has ever been delivered to Australian families in this country by any government. It is the most significant package. We have made a commitment to strengthening families and we have a strengthening families strategy. This strengthening families strategy goes to the very heart of the question that the honourable member has put: that there are many out there in the community who have suffered over the years of the recession we `had to have', which was created by the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These families have found themselves in times of additional hardship and difficulty and this government and this Prime Minister have acknowledged and done something about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3395"> these particular families. In that respect we have set aside $20 million in additional funds for emergency relief. This is to help those families who have fallen on hard times and whom the recession has bitten&mdash;particularly those families in rural and regional Australia. The community welfare organisations that are often the first point of contact for these families have made a commendable effort to respond to the hardships experienced by families. They have done so with great compassion but they have lacked the funds to be able to help to the degree that they need to. So, as I say, in recognition of that the government has set aside an additional $20 million for emergency relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also very deeply concerned about the incidence of suicide amongst our young people. It is a great tragedy that this country cannot afford to continue to ignore. We cannot afford to continue to ignore this problem. In recognition of the need to support communities in preventing the great tragedy of youth suicide in this country&mdash;one of the highest youth suicide records in any OECD country&mdash;we have given an additional $19 million in funding to prevent this terrible tragedy occurring within our communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been an enormous problem over the last several years of a growing number of our young people who have been out on the streets and homeless. As soon as the Prime Minister came to office he announced to the Australian people that we would implement a youth homeless strategy and that we would implement pilot projects across the nation to try to deal with what is a very serious and debilitating problem for young Australian people, that is, those who do not have a home to go to or those who have left home because of difficulties and argument with families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important program. We have allocated $8 million to this pilot project. It is designed to try to reunite young people with their families as a priority. We understand that is not always the case. Where it is not the case, we will seek to make sure that there is continuity in education, that there is continuity in health and that there is continuity in accommodation provision for these young <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people.

They are the real heroes and heroines of our community who look after those in our community who are frail or suffering from chronic and debilitating diseases. These are the people who need our support. These are the people we promised we would give our support to as we came up to the Australian people in the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in recognition of the great difficulties that people who are carers do face in this community, we have also set aside an additional $36 million for respite care. In addition to that, in our strengthening families strategy we have recognised the difficulty for sole parents in this community, and we have ensured that they will receive a fair and decent pension and that they will have job opportunities. That is absolutely critical to strengthening family units in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer delivered the budget last night. We made families the centrepoint of this budget. It is of vital importance to this country.

He has betrayed the low income families who live not just in Penrith, not just in the electorate of Bass, but right across the country, who depend on this basic health care system to make sure that they get reasonable and fair access to good health care in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Worst of all, the Prime Minister has betrayed the retired couples who live in electorates such as Moncrieff and other retirement areas right across the country. He has betrayed the retired people who could even live in the electorate of Cowper, Mr Deputy Speaker. They will now have to pay an average of $26,000 as an up-front entrance fee if they wish to go into a nursing home. On top of that, those retired people will now have to pay an extra charge for being in that nursing home. They will be paying up to an extra $34 a day, depending on a means test. I admit that full&hyphen;rate pensioners will not pay it, but any part&hyphen;rate pensioner or any person whose income means they get no pension will be up for the additional fee because of the new means test on the government's subsidy for nursing homes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3399">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of all these measures, this is a mean budget. It is a mean budget for all of these reasons. Far from it being a budget for mainstream Australia, as claimed by the Prime Minister as he trumpets his press releases and appears on radio, the Prime Minister really knows that this is a budget that hurts ordinary working families. It hurts their parents and it is also going to hurt their kids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's mainstream Australia is still standing behind that white picket fence somewhere in a leafy street, probably on the North Shore of Sydney, where a family is going to get greater benefits than the battlers who are living in electorates such as Lindsay&mdash;the battlers where both parents are working in places such as St Clair. John Howard's mainstream Australia might include a family where one parent is working and perhaps the one bread earner is a professional and he gets a company car. That North Shore family will get a bigger tax cut than the battling working family in the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child care is not essential for that North Shore family, where only one parent is working. Both parents do not need to work just to make ends meet, as is the case out in St Clair. The family that lives on the North Shore may well have parents who have retired up to the electorate of Robertson. They might be living on the water at Pearl Beach in a nice but expensive house, with a reasonable nest egg left over. That family will be able to afford the up&hyphen;front fee if ever any of them need to go into a nursing home. They can afford the new higher nursing home charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parents of a family at St Clair may not be in exactly the same position. They could be living in my own electorate. They might have retired to a town like Wyong. They will now be up for the extra cost of their essential medicines, without any compensating increase in their pension. They will now have to cope with longer waiting lists, not just for hospitals but also for emergency dental care, because this Minister for Health and Family Services has scrapped the Commonwealth's dental health program. They could be living within a very tight budget where most of the super <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> goes to pay off the balance of their housing loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these people attend my morning teas and afternoon teas. They come into our electorate offices. Often the only money they have in the bank is a few thousand dollars that they put aside for their burial. These people cannot afford $26,000 as an up&hyphen;front entrance fee to go into a nursing home. How do you expect these sorts of people to raise these sums of money? For example, what if only one member of the couple needs to go into a nursing home? You don't expect the remaining partner to leave the family home? You don't expect them to sell up their family home to pay that $26,000? Surely, we are not at the stage where the Liberal Party are telling battling pensioner couples that they have to sell their home so one of them can afford the up&hyphen;front fee for the nursing home. In addition, they are going to have to cope with that up to $34 a day cost increase for a nursing home place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not everyone is as badly affected as the battlers out in the western suburbs of Sydney. Page 1 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today says `Big business has been largely spared'. We all know that the farmers and the miners are happy because the diesel fuel rebate was spared in the budget, a budget that was determined by this minister and others who are members of the Expenditure Review Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am afraid to say that working families, pensioners and nursing home residents must just wish that they were as important to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services as the banks and the mining companies. Apparently those ordinary Australians&mdash;the working families, the pensioners and the nursing home residents&mdash;are not part of the Prime Minister's mainstream Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can picture the family at St Clair paying off their home and, if they lived in the electorate of Lindsay, maybe even having entrusted John Howard with their vote at the last election. But if one of their kids has a chronic illness and needs a bit more help from their GP or some special treatment from a specialist or the occasional admission to a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3400"> hospital, then last night's budget is very bad news for them. Depending on their doctor and the treatment they get, the budget rebate cuts which this minister for health announced last night will mean that the gap between the doctor's fee and the Medicare rebate will force that family to pay more for their basic health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In question time, the minister for health made a great song and dance about the fact that the Liberal Party, having finally won government, had the great chance to implement their health policies. For 13 years they have been telling us that the magic wand that will solve every problem in health care is to provide incentives for private health insurance. For 13 years they have been telling us, `If you just give us a go, we will fix the problems.' In fact, this minister for health was running around before the election saying that through his health policy he would get the number of Australians in private health insurance back up to 40 per cent of the population. Remember that, Minister? You did not mention that number of 40 per cent today because last night's budget papers contained the most astounding backdown, a backdown of breathtaking proportions.</PARA>

And it is such a clever measure that it will deliver the grand sum of an extra $20 million for public hospitals right across the country! He is such a generous man that he will let the public hospitals keep that extra $20 million! But what he did not tell you is that in the budget released last night, a budget drawn up in part by this minister for health, Budget Paper No. 3 on page 95 makes it clear that there is a cut&mdash;not of $20 million but of $310 million&mdash;in hospital funding for the states.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A cut of $310 million in hospital funding for the states. This minister claims that while it is okay for the public hospitals to keep the extra $20 million&mdash;that is not a rort; he is so generous he lets them keep the $20 million&mdash;because of changes in the way public hospitals are run, there is this terrible thing that he defines as cost shifting, which has left the public hospitals with $31O million too much and he is determined to claw it back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for health and the Prime Minister must be the only two people in Australia who think state public hospitals have got too much money. Your decision last night&mdash;the decision in this document that was tabled last night&mdash;claws back $310 million from public hospitals around the country, and you know it. That is $310 million that could be used to reduce waiting lists right across the country. We are going to hound you for the rest of this term to ask you to defend the decisions you have made to cut back funding for state hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the decisions that were announced last night; in the Premiers Conference we had the federal government slashing funding to the states by $1&half; billion. Since the health budget makes up about a third of the states' budgets, it is clear that that will have a significant impact on the ability of the state governments to fund their public hospitals. There are a whole series of measures that we are concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says, `What we are trying to do is push a few people into private health insurance, only people on high incomes.' But <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3401"> the truth is that by slashing funding for public hospitals, they are forcing all of us to ask ourselves whether we want to put up with longer waiting lists in public hospitals or be pushed into private health insurance. Any measly $8 a week tax rebate for private health insurance or $7 a week family tax cut will go nowhere near making up for the additional cost of private health insurance&mdash;up to $1,600 a year for a family, and that is nowhere matched by the concessions that you are offering. We will make sure that this party is held accountable for what they are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us on this side of the House say that what we believe in is a balanced form of health system in Australia. Certainly, we are not saying that we are against encouraging people to take out private health insurance, but that needs to be balanced by increasing funding for public hospitals. We say to the minister: here is a challenge for you. If you want us to vote for the concessions you are granting for private health insurance, scrap the $310 million cut to public hospitals and, instead of that, put a significant injection of money into our public hospitals, so that we know we are encouraging not just private health insurance, private hospitals and private medicine, but also all of those Australians who rely on public hospitals for their essential health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the challenge for this minister. If they want the Labor Party and the Labor opposition to support their measures to encourage private health insurance, how about doing something for public hospitals and public treatment? That is the test for you, and it is a test we are sure you will not take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other measure that I want to touch on very briefly before I finish is the outrageous misleading not just of the people of Australia but of his own backbench. When the opposition found out that Medicare offices around the country were going to be closing, this minister for health encouraged a few backbenchers by saying, `Don't worry, the chemist shops will be able to act as agents for Medicare.' What we have learnt is that all of these backbenchers have been conned. We will have some form of what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> document issued last night <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> claims will be a self&hyphen;serve facsimile system which will allow people perhaps to fax away their Medicare application forms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to those government backbenchers who took that line&mdash;hook, line and sinker&mdash;from the minister for health when he told them that the chemist shops would replace the Medicare agencies, let us hear where they stand now. Let us hear where those government backbenchers stand, having received all of those petitions that have been circulated by the chambers of commerce and the mayors right across the country. They know what it means to shut down the Medicare offices in regional Australia. We know what it means when you cut back funding for public hospitals by $310 million. We know what it means for ordinary Australians when you go about cutting Medicare rebates, cutting the funding that is available for a decent public health system in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the last election the Prime Minister said he wanted us all to feel comfortable and relaxed. If last night's budget is meant to make anyone who needs decent health care feel comfortable and relaxed, I would hate to see what would happen if John Howard really took a stick to us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party has got one basic problem, that is, they stopped reforming Medicare 12 years ago, immediately after it was introduced. We get a good insight into the problems of the health system in Australia by looking at two quotes. I would like to read them both to the House. The first quote is this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, again, Labor aren't recognising the big problem. It's still a huge problem&mdash;that people are deserting health insurance at the rate they are. It isn't a problem any of you will worry about tomorrow, but in 10 years time it will be.</PARA>
<PARA>The second quote is this:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3402">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had my go at dealing with that issue, but I think it's a bit of a time bomb for the health system. And we won't keep Medicare if we don't keep reforming it. I believe we've got too many GPs out there in the field ordering up too many services.</PARA>
<PARA>Those two quotes were made by two former Labor Party cabinet ministers. The first one, about private health insurance, was made by Graham Richardson in February this year. The second quote was by Brian Howe, a former health minister and Labor Deputy Prime Minister, in April this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is we have very substantial problems in our health system. If they are not addressed, it means we have a system that we simply will not be able to have in a decade's time. The problems are fairly simple. They are one of costs that are increasing at a rate we cannot afford. The Medicare benefits schedule is a $6.2 billion program. That is more than the entire budget of the state of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we had done nothing on what we found when we came to government, we would have seen that go up 30 per cent over the next four years. So we simply had no option but to do something about it if we wish to retain Medicare, and we do. Similarly, the pharmaceutical benefits system, a $2.2 billion program, is going up 11 per cent compound a year. No government expenditure can cope with that sort of compound increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have tried to do is make a series of reforms that will take health care into the 21st century. I would like to run through the major areas of reform to address the shadow minister's concern. The first is the area of private health insurance. We are not supporting private health insurance for any ideological reason. We are not supporting it because we choose this over the public system. We are supporting it for the very simple reason that unless you have a system where public and private can co-exist our health system will not survive. Again in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> today, the former health minister Graham Richardson says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I steered a package through the Cabinet but resigned before I could sell it to the Caucus. Practically the whole package died when I left as the Labor Party had always been a bit biased against <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> private health insurance. Without a sponsor, any proposal to help the industry was doomed.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem with that is that we have been losing about two per cent of the population out of private health insurance net per year. Some come in, but far more go out. The net effect is two per cent. Every time people drop out, it does two things. It means more people have to use the public hospital system, so there is a greater demand for beds, and it shifts costs from the Commonwealth to the states in that there are fewer doctors drawing on Medicare but they are drawing sessional payments from the states or fee-for-service from the states. My own department estimates that that is equivalent to two big city public hospitals brimful 365 days a year every year compounded just from the two per cent who drop out each time.</PARA>
<PARA>So we are going to put a floor under the drop&hyphen;out. That in itself will take two big city public hospitals full of demand off the system each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware of the 40 per cent figure that the shadow minister uses. I know where it came from. It came from the Access Economics document that we released before the last election because they costed our policy. To be honest with you, I remember it very well because I was angry. Every percentage increase that was estimated meant more money I had to find to fund the initiative. It would have been in our interest to shoot low because it would have cost less to fund. But we accepted what Access Economics said and we funded it to the dollar as they said it. On every occasion that I talked about this&mdash;and the shadow minister can check it&mdash;I always qualified the figure by saying, `This is what has been estimated by Access Economics. We may or may not achieve it.' <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are trying to do is put a floor under it. So I am quite happy with the incentive. I am quite happy that it is going to take demand off the public hospitals. I am quite happy that it is going to give them breathing space and do something to address the issue of waiting lists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that has put Medicare under very great threat is the issue of cost shifting from the states to the Commonwealth. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3403"> This has been an endemic problem. I had a report given to me by the task force on radiology costs. I think honourable members should listen to what the radiology profession has said to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Control of state&hyphen;Commonwealth cost shifting is critical if we are going to contain costs in diagnostic imaging. Cost shifting occurs because federal Medicare is an uncapped program while the Commonwealth health grants to the states are capped. As the states confront their budget realities in the light of ever increasing demand for health care dollars, the temptation to transfer patients into Commonwealth funding streams is overwhelming. Double dipping occurs when state health grant funded public hospital resources are utilised to provide services to private patients which are then charged to Medicare. Cost shifting and double dipping are endemic structural problems that will continue indefinitely unless the Commonwealth acts decisively.</PARA>
<PARA>This has been a problem for the best part of a decade. It is a problem that is accelerating. It is a problem that was discussed by the former Labor health minister at the Commonwealth&hyphen;state health ministers conference in Alice Springs in June 1995. It is a problem that the states promised to stop in June 1995 and yet it has gone on unabated and it is accelerating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to explain to honourable members what the nature of this is. Maybe some of them have had experience of it themselves. At one hospital in Melbourne alone there are 62 so-called privatised outpatient clinics where traditionally people would have seen a doctor at no charge in the public hospital. That hospital has now set up 62 so-called private outpatient clinics and bills the Commonwealth for something that they have historically done. This is completely contrary to the Medicare agreements. It is completely contrary to the undertaking the states gave in 1995. Yet the previous government knew of its existence and was unable or unwilling to do anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a hospital casualty in Melbourne today you can walk in and be confronted by a sign saying: `Bulkbilling Medicare clinic specialising in plaster removal'. So when you go into casualty you had better take your Medicare card with you. Public hospital casualties are billing the Commonwealth under Medicare. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> People who are being worked up for operations or who are being treated post&hyphen;operatively are having the pre-op and the post-op work-ups done out in the private sector, not in the hospital. We know this because the rate of increase in the growth of radiology and pathology in those practices near public hospitals has been going up exponentially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Or we see it in the way hospitals now send people home with two days prescription and say, `Go and see your GP and get another script.' The problem with this is that the states will put $10 of costs onto the Commonwealth to save $1 of costs themselves. This cost shifting threatens the very essence of Medicare. If it is not addressed, we will not have Medicare survive. So I make no apology for addressing it. In the context of overall hospital funding the simple fact is that the entire Medicare agreement is preserved. That is not just the base grants for the hospital but all the add-ons, the bonus pool arrangement, the quality assurance programs. The other parts of Medicare have no cut to them whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very strong argument for actually taking something off in terms of efficiency dividend because, in my own state of Victoria, they have been able to increase unit productivity in hospitals by 30 per cent, and the states have taken the entire productivity dividend themselves. The Commonwealth has kept paying it at the old level. But in spite of that argument, we made a conscious decision to single out two areas&mdash;medical research, because of its importance, and public hospital funding, to preserve the entire funding over the four years under the Medicare agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, as I mentioned in question time, there will be very significant financial gains from the private health insurance initiative that we will not attempt to claw back. I completely reject the proposition that, because we are taking an active proposal to stop the cost shifting that is happening at an accelerating rate, that in any way disadvantages public hospitals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It wasn't Victoria, no. That is the basic problem that we have, and that is a problem that threatens the entire Medicare system. If we are going to give hospitals, let us say, $100 million and they say, `But we're going to take another $10 million out of Medicare that we don't deserve or are not entitled to under the Medicare benefits,' and I say, `Well, I'm going to take a little bit of that back and the net effect is that you have $108 million when you're supposed to have $100 million,' it is in fact not a cut; it means that they are getting additional resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is something that I would have thought members opposite would have welcomed because, if you actually care about the integrity of the health system that was introduced in 1984, the system will not survive unless we stop cost shifting. They are two areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other big area of reform that we have tackled is the area that Brian Howe identified, and that is the issue of unrestricted access into general practice, something that can potentially bring down the entire Medicare system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have 4,000 to 5,000 too many Gps in urban areas; we have 500 too few Gps in country areas. Each one of those additional doctors on Medicare puts somewhere between $170,000 and $200,000 additional costs onto the system each year. In the end, if we want our system to survive, that is a reform that has been long overdue. So we have been prepared to tackle that area as well to ensure the system's long-term viability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The whole budget in health has not been just about dollars. We have tried to put a number of areas of reform together with a number of areas of other particular commitments. We have made a particular commitment to medical research, completely un touched in the forward estimates. Next week, I will be meeting with the Wellcome Foundation in London to discuss how the Commonwealth can meet their offer for additional money for research funding. If we are able to do that&mdash;and I believe we will be&mdash;it will mean the biggest one&hyphen;off increase for biomedical research in this country's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are prepared to re&hyphen;focus the health debate in Australia so that it is not just a health financing debate, as it has been for the best part of 20 years, with a major initiative and commitment to public health. By broadbanding public health, we have given the Commonwealth substantial flexibility. We have made additional significant commitments to diabetes, to childhood immunisation, and to maternal health&mdash;things that have been long overdue, things that will give us a real health debate in this country, not just a debate about health dollars. We also have a public health partnership with the states that recognises that, if we are going to do anything in this difficult federation of ours, we have got to try to do it together rather than us running separate programs, as we have been doing for the past 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got a major and substantial difficulty with rural health. Those members that represent rural electorates will know the difficulties we face in trying to attract young doctors and young specialists into the country. We are not going to fix it in the short term, but we have delivered in this budget on substantial measures that offer some hope with this in the medium term. And in the area of Aboriginal health, we have made a commitment to address the most disadvantaged of Aboriginal Australians, those who have no access to health services whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, we have tried to mix a difficult task with addressing the chronic intractable problems that have not been addressed, and which have been crying out to be addressed, in this country. In the end, what it will give us is a system that is sustainable, and it is the only prospect that we have of having Medicare into the 21st century.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This budget holds no joy for the aged who rely on full or part pensions for their well <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3405"> being. The government has agreed to maintain the Labor commitment to keeping pensions at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings and to maintain twice&hyphen;yearly indexation. It is true that we should be grateful for small mercies. The last time that Howard was in government, he cancelled some indexations and made pensioners lose the equivalent of one year's pension over a year. This time, pensions themselves will stay the same but pensioners will lose at least as much from a myriad of cuts and new charges. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just look at a few of those. Pensioners certainly rely very heavily on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme for the drugs they need for good health. All pensioners will now have to pay 20 per cent more for their prescription drugs. All pensioners will have to spend $26 more to meet the PBS safety net. What will pensioners do in the face of these increased costs? Where will they go? So much for looking after pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dental health: Labor helped to introduce a new scheme for all pensioner health benefit cards so that pensioners could get access to the Commonwealth dental health scheme. What we were trying to do&mdash;what we did do there&mdash;was reduce massive waiting lists that existed in the states. In my own state of Victoria, people had to wait for three years to get basic dental care&mdash;three years for a filling; three years so that you could eat decent food. And what did we see this government do with the dental health program? It completely abolished it. So much for caring about older people who need decent dental care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as home and community care goes, we have had a commitment from this government to maintain home and community care. But how is it that we are going to maintain home and community care? This is what is in the small print. What pensioners are going to have to do, what all older people are going to have to do to get access to home and community care, is to pay for 20 per cent of the cost of home and community care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not going to be funded out of the budget. It will be funded partly out of the budget and, of course, 20 per cent will be out of people's pockets. It is also true that the states have had their grants for home and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community care reduced by three per cent. So the states will have less money for spending on home and community care. That will be another reason for making sure that the balance of the cost comes out of pensioners' pockets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The estimate that we have made of what pensioners will be paying is an increase of $4 per hour for care. If you are a pensioner who has somebody come to your home for a couple of hours a week, that is another $8. On top of having to meet your private dental costs, on top of having to meet the increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals, you will also have to pay about $8 a week on average for home care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nursing homes are where the really serious money comes to pass. Following this budget, part-pensioners are going to have to pay entry contributions for nursing home care. That has never been the case before. It will cost $26,000 to get a place in a nursing home. For those who cannot pay such a huge entry sum, for those who just do not have it, we are told that the government is going to make a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In nursing homes, we are going to end up with something which everybody in this House should abhor&mdash;that is, a two&hyphen;tier system for nursing home care. It will mean decent care for those who have the $26,000 to pay to get a nursing home bed and poor care for those who do not have the money. I would have thought that we had passed those days for nursing home care. This will not just be a terrible thing for the resident facing that sort of poor care but it will also cause grave hardship for families who are trying to do the best by their elderly parents to find the $26,000 to make sure that they get a decent nursing home bed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not stop there. I just want to correct something which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in question time. He suggested that there was only one change in the nursing home arrangements, one change to introduce entry contributions. In fact, that is not the case. I am now quoting from a facts sheet from the Department of Health and Family Services and, as it makes clear, there will be an additional income tested charge of 25c in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3406"> the dollar above the pension free area for nursing home and hostel residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a very significant change, and it is not something the older people knew about before the election. They did not know that they were going to have to pay to get into nursing homes. They did not know that they were going to have to pay once they were in nursing homes. There was no discussion of that whatsoever before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems for older people and the impact on their families does not stop there. The impact on families needs to be looked at from the point of view of children as well. In the time remaining, I will touch on some of the very serious inequities that have arisen with changes to the child&hyphen;care arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no better example than the one used by the government in the budget to laud their family tax initiative. A two&hyphen;income family with two dependent children where the father, a motor mechanic, earns $32,000 and the mother, a sales assistant, earns $35,000 a year attracts a benefit of $7.70 a week. This family is actually going to need almost four times this amount to cover the increase in the cost of child care announced in this budget. Such a family using community child care can expect to lose at least $14 per child per week&mdash;so for two children, $28&mdash;in operational subsidies alone. Before we even start, that family has just gone backwards by at least $20 a week. As I said before, the changes announced by the government reorganise the whole child&hyphen;care system to the detriment of working parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us consider another example. A two&hyphen;income family living in Penrith with two dependent children under the age of five where the father earns $39,000 as a teacher and the mother earns $36,000 as a nurse will receive no assistance whatsoever under the family tax initiative. If this family uses community child care, it can expect to lose at least $28 per week and a further $26 in the child&hyphen;care cash rebate. It has just gone backwards by $54 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Let us contrast this example with the traditional one breadwinner family with two dependent children and a father earning $68,000 a year. Under the family tax initia tive, this family is better off by $17 a week and they do not have any child&hyphen;care bills. So the budget has just put a gap of over $70 a week between these two families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nub of the problem with the government's approach to child care lies with the operational subsidy. I might just point out yet another broken promise. In a letter dated 28 February of this year to the national director of the Australian Early Childhood Association, the then shadow minister, Dr David Kemp, stated:</PARA>

<PARA>The implications for child care around this country are very serious. We will no longer have a community based child-care sector. We will no longer have that choice for parents in our system. We will have parents having to pay between $14 and $20 a week more for child care per child. That is not the sort of increase that this family tax initiative takes into account at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to take part in this debate today. The subject of this MPI is full of hypocrisy because it was the previous Labor government that left us with the Bankcard bill that we have to deal with. We wish we did not have that. We wish we did not have to make cuts. We wish we had money to spread around, but it needs to be remembered that it is never the government's money; it is the taxpayers' money and the people who are voted in to govern this country are really just put in charge of managing the trust of the taxpayers' funds. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3407">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hypocritical also because when I sat on that side of the House and there was ever a debate on health or aged care, it struck me every single time that there was no understanding, no plan, no seeing the whole picture and no planning for the future. Now that we have the opportunity, we do have plans and we will put them in place. They are fair and they will think of everybody. The hypocrisy of the subject of this MPI in claiming that it harms families is really the worst of it, because the worst thing that any government can do for the families of Australia is to leave them with a debt and the interest bill to pay on that Bankcard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody will be denied access to residential care because they cannot pay and there are provisions and guarantees to ensure that this is the case. To say otherwise is just fiddling with the policy and the budget. Funding for public hospitals is maintained and I will argue that it will be increased, because the incentives and assistance that we are providing for private health insurance will not only provide people with greater choice about what care and hospital they are in but also it will put more money into the public hospital system as well as relieve the burden on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it extraordinary that the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) can stand in this place as she did in the full knowledge of her party's record on all these issues. As I said, they never saw the whole picture and they certainly did not plan for it. Recently the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was critical of the incentives and assistance we will be providing for private health insurance. He seems to have forgotten what his own health policy was at the last election. I remember thinking that Labor was pretty smart when it came out with providing some package to assist with private health insurance because it had never done so before. However, what it did was leave people out. Labor left out the elderly, the single, the chronically ill and couples without children. We have not done that and that is what this budget and our health policy and direction for the future is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the member for Fremantle (Dr <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Lawrence), members of the public will have to pay a bit more on the Medicare levy if they do not take out private health insurance. Those who are lucky enough to earn more will pay more. There have been flaws in the system and those flaws have seen inadequate funding for dementia care, inflexibility and funding anomalies at the boundary between nursing homes and hostels, outdated and inefficient funding mechanisms, intrusive monitoring processes and a focus on paperwork not care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June 1994 I spoke in this place on the Gregory report. Professor Gregory revealed the crisis facing nursing homes, the provision of aged care and the quality of it. He said at the time that the upgrading of existing stock may cost as much as $520 million. He also pointed out the lack of incentives to maintain good quality nursing home stock. Eighteen per cent of residents were living in rooms with five or more beds and toilets were not large enough to allow carers or walking frames in with the resident. The present funding system which we have inherited from Labor did not provide sufficient funds and does not attract the applications necessary for placements and upgrading of nursing homes in the voluntary sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are heading for an increasing aged population. Based on the 1991 census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics suggests that currently about two million Australians, or 11 per cent of us, are in the high age user group of 65 years and over and some 400,000 are over the age of 80. Labor gave no long&hyphen;term thought to this section of the community or as to how to sustain aged care as it currently stands. This is a particularly irresponsible state of affairs, with the ABS figures predicting that the over&hyphen;65 population will rise to four million in this country by the year 2021. This has huge implications for public policy and demands both a long&hyphen;term commitment and sincere efforts to deliver equitable and quality services. Labor never addressed these concerns and has no credibility whatsoever to come into this place today and criticise anything that the coalition government is doing or has outlined.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3408">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one speaks to people who work in the provision of aged care, such as nursing home directors, they tell you things like authorities are not prepared or are unable to acknowledge the level of care required for dementia sufferers. Their needs are quite different from the needs of those with obvious physical frailties or disabilities. There is general agreement that there must be some measure of assessment. The emphasis has been on physical rather than mental health. There are about 14 questions which must be answered and they go something like this: is the patient incontinent; what about the skin integrity; what special nursing is required; is there any physical aggression, verbal disruption, behaviour problems, vision impairment or speech apprehension; what is their mobility; what are their toilet requirements; and what are their washing and dressing requirements, eating requirements and their level of independence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This classification for nursing home residents equals nursing home hours, which in turn, up to now, has equalled dollars. This assessment is a funding tool and does not equate to care given. It gives little recognition to dementia. There is no classification either for palliative care, but palliative care is being given in nursing homes. This equals many hours of specialised care. One nursing home patient is on a ventilator. He is not incontinent; he is not physically aggressive; and he is not verbally disruptive. Therefore, he scores few points, few nursing hours and few dollars, but in fact he requires one&hyphen;to&hyphen;one care for between three and six hours per day. Prior to his admission to the nursing home, he received 24&hyphen;hour care which was HAC funded and therefore a cost also to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was the Labor system and now they complain when we want to change it and make things better. The changes that we have put in place in this budget will take place on 1 July 1997 and these changes are in response to the needs and include unifying nursing home and hostel systems into a single residential aged care system. I cannot think of a single better plan to have in place for those ageing Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a real need to recognise that often one is admitted to a hostel that one pays to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> get into&mdash;after all, that is what we are arguing and what we will do&mdash;but you cannot pay to get into a nursing home. Once into the hostel&mdash;and many of them are on the same site as nursing homes&mdash;there needs to be that flexibility and that capacity to transfer from one to the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, in many cases the spouse who will not be admitted to a nursing home might require hostel accommodation. Can you imagine two people who have lived together in a close family relationship for perhaps 50 or 55 years, or even less than that, one being in a hostel one side of town and the other being in a nursing home somewhere else? We need to be able to bring these types of facilities together, because it is showing that we care about the whole person and having some plans for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, in the past it has been okay to pay to get into a hostel but not to get into a nursing home. But the level of care has come closer together. Once those living in hostels were fairly fit, but as the criteria and the lack of beds have become more evident it has become closer. So now you get told quite often that those who were once being cared for in nursing homes are in fact being cared for in hostels. We need to be able to bring those systems together, and we will do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will implement a single residential classification mechanism to assess dependency and allocate funding. We will pay particular attention to the needs of residents with severe dementia. We will slash the red tape, which means more time for care. We will provide incentives for the provision of quality accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those providing accommodation, particularly in the not-for&hyphen;profit sector, will welcome this because they have had a real desire to be able to provide better accommodation. The policies that we have in place&mdash;the plan that we will put into being&mdash;will certainly provide for that. With our ageing population, which we should all be thinking about over the next 30 years, I suppose, there needs&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill makes various amendments to the Defence Act and Naval Defence Act, together with consequential amendments to the Air Force Act and other Commonwealth legislation. All the amendments are associated with ongoing improvements to command and administration arrangements for the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition came to government with a commitment to improving the management of Australia's defence. Central to achieving this commitment is ensuring that the command structure of the Defence Force is appropriate for Australia's present and future national security requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New arrangements for the command of the Defence Force are being introduced in stages. It is an objective of this process to delineate more clearly the responsibilities of the various levels of command and to ensure in particular that responsibility for operations is vested in the proposed Headquarters Australian Theatre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In association with the organisational changes, it is necessary to change the designations and titles of various components of the organisation. This bill introduces new titles for the heads of the three services. The changes to the titles, from chiefs of staff to Chief of Navy, Chief of Army and Chief of Air Force, recognise the continuing role of the service chiefs as commanders of the navy, army and air force with that role set in the framework of the new command structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The Chief of the Defence Force, General John Baker, announced the planned changes to the command arrangements in January 1996. These changes, to be introduced be tween now and the year 2000, will further refine the Defence Force's command capability at the strategic and operational levels. When complete, the revised arrangements will allow flexibility when planning for, and committing, the Defence Force to operations. Importantly, they will also introduce a structure that is identical in times of peace and war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key element of the changes is the incorporation of the navy, army and air force offices in Canberra into the Headquarters Australian Defence Force as component headquarters. This happened on 1 July 1996 when the navy, army and air force offices were retitled Navy, Army and Air Force Headquarters respectively. The title changes for the service chiefs naturally flow from their modernised command role in this new structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second set of amendments deals with the transfer of personnel between the services. At present, there is no legislative provision for the direct transfer of personnel from one service to another. Such a transfer requires formal separation from one service, then appointment to, or enlistment in, the other service. This is a cumbersome procedure and administratively costly. These amendments are designed to streamline the administration of transfers by enabling the direct transfer of personnel between the services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new transfer power is vested with the chief of the service that is losing the member. The consent of a transferred member is required, and the chief of the service that is to gain the member must also agree. An instrument of transfer would specify the rank, seniority and period of appointment or enlistment that are to apply on transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a provision to ensure that any return of service obligation applying to a transferred member will continue to apply after the transfer. A further provision ensures that service in the losing service is counted as service in the gaining service for purposes such as the calculation of leave entitlements. A service chief can delegate a power to authorise or approve a transfer under these provisions, but not to an officer holding a rank below that of brigadier or the equivalent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3410">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third set of amendments is to provisions which require 12 months service by certain officers after they are promoted. Under existing provisions, the service chiefs may reject the resignation of an officer who holds the substantive rank of colonel, or equivalent, or higher where the officer has not completed a period of 12 months service since being promoted to that rank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These provisions are designed to increase efficiency by reducing the posting turbulence caused by officers who accept promotion and then resign shortly afterwards. Curbing this practice facilitates smoother personnel management with less disruption to family life and allows substantial savings in removal and associated costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same considerations apply to officers who accept promotion to the substantive ranks of major, or equivalent, or lieutenant colonel or equivalent. The provisions are accordingly widened to enable the relevant service chief to reject the resignation of an officer who holds the substantive rank of major, or equivalent, and above where the officer has not completed a period of 12 months service in the rank since being promoted to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final set of amendments enables the delegation of the power of the Governor&hyphen;General to make limited tenure promotions. In 1995, defence legislation was amended to enable the Governor&hyphen;General to make promotions for fixed periods&mdash;limited tenure promotions. The effect of such a promotion is that an officer is retired on completion of the period unless offered an extension or, alternatively, further service at the original rank level. These provisions are intended to allow for a limited number of promotions to colonel, or equivalent rank or above where an individual has skills relevant to a particular appointment rather than skills that will enable continued employability at the higher rank level. Limited tenure promotions are for a set period, normally three years, and may be declined by the officers concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Governor&hyphen;General has delegated his general powers to promote officers in the Defence Force, but the current delegation provisions do not cover limited tenure promotions. The amendments accordingly enable the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Governor&hyphen;General to delegate the power to make limited tenure promotions. The delegations may be to only the Chief of the Defence Force or a service chief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated earlier, these rather disparate amendments are linked in that they are all part of the continuing effort to improve the management of the Defence Force. I am confident that the House will support the legislation as part of that effort. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1, item 41, page 14 (lines 11 to 17), omit proposed subsection 8(1A).</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment is to delete proposed subsection 8(1A) from item 41. The reasons for wanting an amendment to this particular subsection of the act are as follows. As indicated in the debate in the Main Committee, proposed subsection 8(1A) would, in effect, make it extraordinarily difficult for the Attorney-General to provide assistance in the case of a request by a foreign country for assistance under the act related to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with or convicted of an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed in the foreign country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As debated in the Main Committee&mdash;I do not want to rehash the entire debate&mdash;this proposed subsection would make it virtually impossible in relation to the prosecution of a person in a foreign country where the death penalty may be imposed and Australian interests are at stake. Let us take, for instance, the country of Thailand, where a considerable number of statutes involve capital punishment as a penalty. The last part of that particular clause states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . unless the Attorney-General is of the opinion, having regard to special circumstances of the case, that the assistance requested should be granted.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the only circumstances in which that assistance would be granted are ones in which the Attorney-General, in accordance with the policy enunciated in the explanatory memorandum, was able to get an assurance that the death penalty, if imposed, would not be carried out or, for instance, where the assistance sought by the request is of an exculpatory nature&mdash;in other words, would be to try and have the person acquitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem in relation to a number of our immediate neighbours is that it would be highly unlikely that they would give an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> assurance of this sort. We have in relation to the United States a similar situation where there are federal and state statutes providing for the death penalty in certain cases and where a similar situation would be difficult, although I have been advised that in the case of the United States that assurance may be easier to obtain than in the case of other countries that are more close in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of my amendment is to remove that requirement&mdash;in other words, that blanket ban which it effectively in practice will almost be&mdash;and to provide for the discretion of the Attorney-General, which is provided for in proposed subsection 8(1B). In other words, even though the provisions of proposed subsection 8(1A) will have been removed by my amendment, there is still built into proposed subsection 8(1B) the provision for the exercise of the Attorney-General's discretion in cases where, for instance, the Australian government may believe the refusal of a request should take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose the nub of this debate over the amendment will be whether or not the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) concedes that proposed subsection 8(1A) may amount to a significant impedance of our international fight against drug trafficking because of the likely imposition it puts in the way of our relations with some of our South&hyphen;East Asian neighbours in particular and, secondly, whether or not he accepts the fact that in proposed subsection 8(1B) that discretion is still built in to provide him the opportunity of being able to refuse assistance where the policy objectives of his government are not met by the country requesting that assistance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this matter was brought on for debate this morning in the Main Committee I was obliged to be in the House on other matters. I am indebted to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) representing the government on the summing up of this bill. I record my thanks for his very professional efforts in putting the government's view on a difficult topic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3412"> The matter raised by the member for Moore (Mr Filing) is really the only point of conten tion. The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act has been in operation for about 10 years. It was the subject of a review, which was very wide ranging, involving consultation with prosecution and investigation agencies, law societies, bar councils, the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Law Reform Commission and representatives of civil liberties groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision in contention, item 41 of schedule 1 of the bill, was given strong support in the debate by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), who spoke for the opposition. The member for Murray (Mrs Stone) is the only other speaker and also supported the provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subclause 8(1A) provides that the Attorney-General must refuse a request for assistance from a foreign country if it relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with or convicted of an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed in the foreign country unless the Attorney-General is of the opinion, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, that the assistance requested should be refused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subsection therefore only applies where charges carrying the death penalty have already been laid or a person has already been convicted of an offence carrying the death penalty. In this situation the request must be refused, except in special circumstances. The subsection creates a general rule that assistance will be refused but an exception where the Attorney is of the opinion there are special circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a matter of practice, the requesting country would be asked to give an assurance that the death penalty, if imposed, would not be carried out. Special circumstances could occur, for example, if the assistance sought may be of an exculpatory nature and might enable the defendant successfully to defend the charges carrying the death penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subclause 8(1B) in the same clause provides that a request by a foreign country for assistance under the act may be refused if the Attorney-General believes that provision of the assistance may result in the death penalty being imposed on a person and, after taking <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into consideration the interests of international criminal cooperation, is of the opinion that in the circumstances of the case the request should not be granted. This subclause applies where charges have not yet been laid in the foreign country and the subsection will give the Attorney-General considerably more discretion to grant assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Moore is concerned that subclause 8(1A) puts a blanket ban on assistance where charges have been laid. He suggested that the only situation, on his reading of the explanatory memorandum, where the request would be granted would be where the foreign country indicates a death penalty, if imposed, would not be carried out. This I think, with respect, is not a proper interpretation of subclause 8(1A).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from the terms of subclause 8(1A) that the subsection gives the Attorney-General a discretion to grant assistance where charges have been laid if there are special circumstances arising in a particular matter. The explanatory memorandum notes that the usual practice will be to require the other country to give an undertaking that the death penalty, if imposed, will not be carried out but this is not written into the subsection and therefore does not constitute the only circumstance in which a request might be granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be, and it is desirable, some flexibility to enable the Attorney-General to grant assistance where an undertaking is not given, as indicated in the explanatory memorandum. A very good example would be where the assistance sought may be of an exculpatory nature. This amendment proposed by the member for Moore is not supported by the opposition and is not supported by the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to enlarge on the matter in response to the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams). The Attorney says that my interpretation of the second part of proposed subsection 8(1A) is incorrect. One can only rely on the explanatory memorandum as a guide. Nothing is written into that subclause to provide a guide in itself. In other words, those special circumstances would presumably rely on the policy of the government of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3413">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view is that, under the circumstances that I suppose I have described earlier, there will be a number of instances when some of our neighbouring countries which have, perhaps,  similar aspirations as do we for combating drug trafficking in our region would find that particular requirement&mdash;as it is practically implemented in terms of policy as enunciated in the explanatory memorandum&mdash;a gross impediment to cooperation with Australia. As we know and as I spelled out in the Main Committee, the drug trafficking problem in Australia is part of an international problem. Drug trafficking by its nature is a transnational procedure involving people from different countries and involving the transportation of illicit drugs from one place to another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear from any reading of the most recent material that, in order to combat drug trafficking in this country, Australia is desperately required to participate as fully as possible in international efforts to overcome drug trafficking around the world but, most importantly, in our region. I am referring particularly to countries in our region. I mentioned in the Main Committee that it is ironic that we provide military training to personnel of the Indonesian armed forces who have killed their own innocent citizens in demonstrations and the like, yet if you have, say, a major drug trafficker arrested in Indonesia&mdash;or, for that matter, in Thailand&mdash;Australia would not provide assistance unless the government concerned provided the assurance that the death penalty would not be carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my understanding that that assurance could not be given in a number of instances. Certainly if the boot were on the other foot and we were the country concerned and we had the death penalty that would be the case&mdash;you could not give an assurance. Therefore, in terms of mutual assistance, we would not be able to fulfil what I consider to be our obligations within the sorts of international cooperative agreements we have with those countries. Bearing in mind that our drug problem is essentially a South&hyphen;East Asian drug problem, if you combine that with the cuts that have been applied in the case of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> AFP, the NCA and the Customs Service, the totality of all that is that we are going to see another impedance in the effort to combat drug trafficking in this country. I would have thought, under the circumstances, that is something that the majority of the community in Australia would be totally and utterly opposed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I am saying is that my amendment would remove the total ban which it almost in essence is. It would provide that discretion in proposed subsection 8(1B). The Attorney says proposed subsection 8(1B) is not relevant to this case but, if you read it, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A request by a foreign country for assistance under this Act may be refused if the Attorney&hyphen;General:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> (a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> believes that the provision of the assistance may result in the death penalty being imposed on a person.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly that would, in my view, cover the situations which I described earlier. I am repeating myself in saying that if, for instance, there were a repetition of the Oklahoma bombing in the United States and there were some Australian connection then one could argue, perhaps successfully, that Australia may well refuse assistance to the United States government in detecting suspects or providing information or evidence that might lead to the apprehension, arrest and prosecution of the persons responsible for terrorism.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is well aware of the implications of the provisions under debate for international cooperative efforts. There has been a similar policy applied for some years and it has not, up to now, resulted in significant impediment to the success of international cooperation. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) should bear in mind that we are concerned here only with the exercise of coercive powers. We are concerned also with the possibility of not only foreign nationals but also Australian citizens being the subject of a charge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not propose to debate the subject of what Indonesian soldiers may or may not have done: nobody suggests that the sort of conduct the member for Moore referred to is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3414"> condoned. The point of this debate is that there comes a point at which Australia has to stand up for the values it proclaims. One of the relevant values is our internationally stated opposition to the death penalty. The point where we should stand up is where there are no special circumstances in a matter where charges which carry the death penalty in the requesting country have been laid and the country refuses to give an assurance that the death penalty will not be carried out. That is a circumstance in which, ordinarily, government policy would require that the request be refused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Moore is no doubt aware, the death penalty has been abolished in all Australian jurisdictions since 1984. In addition, Australia is a party to the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which commits Australia to an anti&hyphen;death penalty position at the international level. I do not apologise in any way for saying that, where special circumstances such as the need for exculpatory evidence do not exist and where the other country will not give an assurance it will not carry out the death penalty, we should refuse assistance. It is entirely consistent with our national opposition to the death penalty to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where no special circumstances exist and the other country declines to give the undertaking, we cannot escape the fact that Australia could be giving assistance which could assist another country to execute a person. I do not say that in the future that assistance, if this legislation is passed in the proposed form, would never be given, but it would be a very rare circumstance. Australia considers the death penalty as abhorrent, and it would be inconsistent with this position for us, indirectly, to assist another country in condemning a person to death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also of some assistance to those involved in the negotiations with foreign countries, in relation to mutual assistance in criminal matters, that Australia is able to state its position clearly. It leaves the countries with whom negotiations are being held in no doubt as to where Australia stands in relation to assistance for offences in those countries <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> carrying the death penalty, at least where charges have been laid or a conviction has been entered. The government in this respect believes that it is far better to be explicit and not to raise false expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the member for Moore's concern about international cooperation. I do not believe the passage of the legislation in the form proposed by the government would represent a significant obstacle to international cooperation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to answer two things. The first thing is that my understanding is that the assurance in this particular form has never been sought before. So I am not entirely sure how one can relate to the experience in some other format under the previous administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing is that there are a number of concerns from some of our neighbours. I recollect very clearly a conference on organised crime in Sydney in 1994, at which delegates from law enforcement agencies in other countries were very strident in their criticism of Australia. These were countries that we would rely on very heavily in drug trafficking investigations and information exchange. That is a serious concern. It is serious enough to the extent that I would have thought it would amount to an impedance of some note. They certainly felt it was and, in the discussions in Sydney, they felt that it was something that Australia should deal with. I say to the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) that I am pleased that he is endeavouring to codify it in the act, because my understanding was that under previous circumstances it was an informal policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3415"> The other aspect of his argument was that he said it is a clear enunciation of Australia's position for the purposes of foreign countries making requests or considering requests. In actual fact, if you read carefully, the enunciation is not clear. The special circumstances are only described in the explanatory memorandum and, presumably, they would change when the government's policy changed. So, in essence, a country that is endeavouring to seek assistance from Australia is going to have the same problem. It will rely, obvious ly, on whatever the policy is at a particular time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the argument that it is explicit&mdash;in other words, a country would be in absolutely no doubt as to Australia's position&mdash;is not entirely accurate as, of course, it would rely on the position at the particular time of the Australian government in order for a foreign government to be able to establish whether or not its request for assistance is likely to succeed. Under those circumstances, I commend the amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not often that a government breaks promises both before and after the election. Before the March election, the coalition promised there would be no new taxes and no existing taxes would be bulked up. After the election, on 12 March the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said that the fiscal consolidation would be by way of outlay reductions. He said that it was the end of days of waste and sloth. What he really meant to say and what is reflected in the budget is that it was the beginning of the days of higher taxing in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a measure of the government's betrayal of its promises before and after the election to note that, under its major revenue measures for 1996&hyphen;97, there is no less than $1.3  billion in revenue raising measures. For the following financial year, 1997&hyphen;98, that increases to $2&half; billion. Who in this country will ever believe a single word that John Howard or Peter Costello say? Before the election they promised no bulking up of existing taxes and no new taxes. We now have a budget, including the measure before the House on sales tax, that includes $1.3 billion of new revenue raising measures in 1996&hyphen;97 and $2.5 billion new revenue raised off the tax base for 1997&hyphen;98&mdash;a budget of betrayal, a budget of absolute gross deceit.</PARA>

The National Party has pulled down the shutters on the idea that the Commonwealth has any legitimate or constitutional role in regional development. It makes you wonder what role the National Party itself could play in the Commonwealth parliament. If they don't believe in regional development what do they believe in? We have a National Party that does not believe in regional development from the Commonwealth!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that the abolition of flood mitigation funding is a major burden now that local government will need to meet in its own right. The employment programs, the new work opportunities program, LEAP, and the Greening Australia programs are another diminution of local government resource capacity. The loss of operational subsidies for long day care is a burden on local government and the abolition of building better cities is a burden on regional Australia and local government in general. So local government has not fared well out of the Treasurer's attempt to grab half a billion dollars of extra revenue. That was blocked by the Premiers and it has led to the measure now before the House, which is undoubtedly in breach of coalition election promises on two fronts. The first, the promise not to bulk up existing taxes, has been broken because this is a bulking up of the sales tax regime in Australia. The second promise, not to touch local government financial capacity, has been broken as well. It is a double whammy of deceit and betrayal of core coalition election promises. What assistance did local government receive from the member for Bass, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith)? Very little assistance indeed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3419">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked a question on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, which he has now answered, on the role he took with the cabinet decision to apply all sales tax to local government. With regard to representations to prevent the Treasurer's announcement, he said, `It is not my position to prevent any government policy nor to act on behalf of one particular sector against government policy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he is not a minister for local government acting on behalf of local government, he is taking his pay every month under false pretences. What sort of minister is it who doesn't see his role around the cabinet table as being to try to stand up for his part of the Commonwealth sector?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very poor performance and excuse by the minister, Warwick Smith. The truth is that the Howard cabinet made a decision to grab half a billion dollars of financial capacity off local government. The minister for local government said it was not within his role to prevent that, to oppose it, to stand up for the local government sector. So all of those 800 councils around Australia will be dismayed that they have such a weak and ineffective minister representing their interests in the federal parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have further cause for concern, not just because of the budget and the loss of financial capacity, but because of the spectre that hangs over their heads from the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit. That is the audit report that the government still has under active consideration. That is part of the budget documents. Do not let anyone around the Commonwealth, the states or the local government sector think they have seen the last of the National Commission of Audit; no way in the world. It is still under active consideration in the budget papers. We will be receiving, as a parliament&mdash;and I think the public will receive&mdash;reports on an ongoing basis over the next 12 months. The worst, I fear, is yet to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For local government, the recommendation was to abolish the residual local government development program. Not only has the government halved that program, but the audit commission has recommended its full abolition and, beyond that, to integrate local <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government financial assistance grants into revised state government payments&mdash;that is, to end direct Commonwealth assistance for local government. So with a government that made a cabinet decision to rip half a billion dollars off local government without compensation and to do it through the sales tax regime, one would not be surprised if they were to adopt that audit commission report to roll local government financial assistance into payments to the states. The Baulkham Hills council, local government in Tasmania or local government in the City of Brisbane would have no guarantee that they would see a single dollar of those grants once they were handed on to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The direct grants should remain. The minister, far from rolling over to the Treasurer and the dries around the cabinet table, should be in the business of standing up for local government. If he had stood up for local government, the sales tax impact of this provision would not be felt, the cabinet decision would not have been made, the audit report would have already been dismissed, and none of those harsh impacts on local government in last night's budget would be before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is cause for concern on every front in this legislation, as is noted in the amendment I have placed before the House. There is cause for concern that a government would so wilfully break its promises so soon after an election. The Prime Minister said that he would reverse what he saw as the decline in standards in public life in Australia and that he could be trusted. He tried to promote the label of `honest John'. He has been shown as nothing more than `dishonest John'&mdash;totally dishonest. He made promises with no intention whatsoever of keeping them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation is part of a government package. It was part of an assessment done as an audit by a specially appointed team. It has been the government's decision that there will be an amendment to the sales tax act with a view to placing on state and local governments&mdash;all governments, in fact&mdash;a sales tax in respect of certain vehicles and parts of those vehicles purchased by governments or government authorities where the vehicles are wholly or partly for private use as part of an employee's remuneration.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me respond. I understand and accept your ruling. I did not in any way attempt to designate a person as trying to mislead. I indicated that the opposition will continue as a body, as a group, each shadow minister playing his own role, to misrepresent the views of the government. That is the attitude and tactic of the opposition. From when they first went into opposition they disclaimed any responsibility for their past actions, any responsibility for the $8 million black hole and all the mess and chaos and unemployment they created. They then proceeded to blame the government for their own actions. That process of misleading is a corporate effort. It is not one individual; they are all the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole process of endeavouring to mislead the Australian public has been part of the strategy of attacking the budget. It has been part of the strategy here in the House with this sales tax legislation, which is doing nothing more than putting into place the proposals put forward on 11 June and then further refined by a subsequent process on 14 June, a press release by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). The measure is expected to raise between $50 million and $100 million&mdash;not the huge amounts that the opposition spokesman has used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what I say is part of an opposition approach to mislead the parliament, the Australian people, in an endeavour to frighten them and change their minds by what the government has done. But it will not wash because the Australian people trust John Howard. They know the mess that you have created as a Labor Party. They know that it is going to be hard to fix it up. When we try to fix it up they say: `They have to be given a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chance to fix it up.' So all the attempts to claim that there are lies and broken promises just will not wash. The attempt to say that the amendments to the sales tax law are a broken promise or a lie is not true. It is just an attempt to mislead on your part. The Australian people will not wear that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the amendment proposed by the opposition says that the provisions are part of a series of broken promises. I refute that and reject that completely. It is completely untrue. This is a fair and strong budget that the government has brought down. The changes to sales tax laws bring in only a marginal amount of money to the government but are necessary to prevent the abuse of the sales tax exemptions given to state and local authorities where an individual, as part of their remuneration package, can buy a car through the state or local government authority, take it on board, resell it and take advantage as part of the resale price of an increase in the value of that vehicle because sales tax then comes back onto the vehicle or is implicit in the retail price of the vehicle. Surely to goodness the opposition is not proposing that we condone that process&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to move on to that point next. I would like to see the opposition justify its attitude because there is every prospect that there has been abuse by local authorities, government authorities and state governments of a sales tax exemption granted by the federal government where an individual may take advantage of a sales tax free vehicle as part of their remuneration, and then in the resale process gain the personal benefits of that resale process. I would like to see a spokesman from the opposition come out clearly and say that they do not support rorts and that, if there is any rorting process in the abuse of sales tax, they will join the government in clamping down on it. But no, they have not chosen to do that. They have said that the bill is part of a process to reduce fiscal capacity. There is nothing of that whatsoever. It is the extension of the Sales Tax Act to draw in tax that should be paid and tax that is eligibly paid by governments <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3422"> where it is part of a remuneration package for individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a broader issue about the mishandling of the Premiers Conference. I thought it was a successful Premiers Conference and one in which all states for once agreed that there needs to be fiscal restraint on the part of the Commonwealth. Despite previous Premiers Conferences, the Commonwealth for once has come out and said that there are problems, there is a deficit, there is unemployment, we have to regain our credit ratings and we will only do that if we take the lead as a Commonwealth. For the first time the Commonwealth has taken the lead in its own budget and has cut its outlays and managed to present an example which, judging by the quick response from Standard and Poor's, has gained a result that was never possible under the previous administration of the country. Standard and Poor's never responded to any of the budgets of the Australian Labor Party the way they have responded to this budget. We are building a record that we are going to be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of last night's budget and the response by the markets it is going to cost less to run government in Australia. By a change in credit ratings we are going to be able to reduce the costs, the premiums, that have been raised against the Australian government because of our poor financial status. The honourable member opposite shakes his head but that is the fact of the matter. The dropping of the AAA rating down to the AA plus rating means it costs the Australian taxpayer extra money to have its government exist. This is part of the process. This sales tax collection is very much in line with the philosophy and intentions of the current government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer the House in particular to a press release put out by the Treasurer on 14 June, where the application of the wholesale sales tax to general purpose road vehicles is clearly spelt out. The press release says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wholesale sales tax will apply to general purpose road vehicles&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It will not be to any other sort of vehicle, just vehicles that are used for general purposes on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the road. That would include utilities, station wagons and cars. The press release continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . provided wholly or partly for private use&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It is for private use. We are not talking about a vehicle that belongs to the local authority or the state government. We are talking about a vehicle that is provided partly or wholly for the private use of an employee of the state or local authority. The release goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as part of remuneration by Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments to take effect from 11 June 1996. Further details will be announced as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has undertaken not to proceed with the withdrawal of the WST exemption in relation to other items canvassed in its offer of 11 June and the Treasurer's associated press release.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely and perfectly clear. The press release continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will protect the integrity of the wholesale sales tax system without affecting most government activities. The Government will continue to monitor exemptions in this area.</PARA>
<PARA>What could be more responsible than the Commonwealth taking a proper interest in the way in which advantages and exemptions from the wholesale sales tax are applied?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), may be interested to know that on the day this was announced I had a call from the mayor of Baulkham Hills&mdash;and the Treasurer knows this&mdash;who said that this was a great move. The mayor said, `I have called my financial officers together. We are going to do a whole restructure in the financing of our vehicles, and we are going to make money out of that process because we are going to do a lease&hyphen;back arrangement. It is all in place. It is the best thing that could have happened to our council because we are now thinking responsibly and using our resources effectively. We are not granting exemptions and opportunities for employees in a way they should not be granted. We are doing the whole thing properly.' He concluded by saying, `I want to thank the Treasurer for the lead that he has shown in proper and responsible financial management.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you knew the mayor of Baulkham Hills, you would know that he is a man who will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3423"> express his view whether he agrees with you or not. In this instance, he agrees with the decision taken by the minister and the impact it will have on local government. He thinks it is responsible and will be beneficial in the long term to local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposition members can argue all they like about whether or not this is a broken promise. The fact is that it is not a broken promise; I refute that completely. There was never any promise made that we would not slightly extend the wholesale sales tax to take in instances where individuals may be rorting the system&mdash;let us hear opposition members say that they support people who are rorting the system&mdash;and taking an advantage as part of their personal remuneration package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have looked back over the files, and I have thought about the claim the Labor Party made today in the House about broken promises. I thought my memory was good, but I checked and found out about the list of Labor broken promises. One Labor pamphlet said: `Labor's tax promise. What I am promising is not to put up tax'. That was what Paul Keating said in 1992. What happened after that promise? In 1992 there was no increase. In 1993 taxes went up by three per cent. In 1994 they went up by 10 per cent. In 1995 they went up by 12.2 per cent. What a promise. The greatest promiser of all times the most promising Prime Minister of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Paul Keating promised so much that, when the Labor Party went to sell him at functions, nobody would take him up. You wanted to sell him for $20,000 a night to anybody who would take him for a function, but he had made so many promises at that point that you did not get any takers to buy him. He is the most easily acquired Prime Minister this country has seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at tax reform. Included in the policies of the Australian Labor Party for the 1993 election was this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's commitment to removing all age and service pensioners from the tax system by 1995 will benefit pensioners paid at the part rate as well as providing some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut out point.</PARA>
<PARA>That was one of your promises. I have pages of your promises. That was part of your <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commitment, but you never kept it. You had no intention of doing it. You broke the promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about excise and the commitment related to that? I will come to excise and indirect taxes, because one of the delights I have is looking at what the Labor Party did with excise and indirect taxes on petroleum. When Labor came to power in 1983, there was a 6.1 per cent per litre excise on petrol. At the beginning of 1996, the excise component of petrol represented almost 36.5c a litre. That is a jump since you guys in the Labor Party came into office from 6c a litre to 36c a litre&mdash;that was in 13 years. What a rip-off. Those are the promises you made&mdash;`We won't increase taxes'&mdash;but look at that amount. It is a sixfold increase on the grab out of the motorists' pocket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about new home owners? Remember the building materials wholesale sales tax. That was not a new tax, was it? That was a commitment specifically given not to increase taxes. Labor has refused to rule out, even today, a 12 per cent sales tax on currently exempt building hardware and materials. That is the Labor Party for you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about new taxes? Ralph Willis, even during the election campaign, refused to rule out the prospect of new taxes. In a debate before the March election he said that, if the Labor Party were re-elected, he could not say what new taxes would be introduced. In contrast, the coalition has guaranteed no new taxes, and there have been no new taxes since we came to office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the Keating slug for the true believers and the EPAC analysis of taxation that the Australian Labor Party applied to superannuants? How did the Labor Party go about correcting the processes of superannuation and the problems they had created? They set in place a scheme where they gave a five per cent tax advantage on superannuation to low income earners and a 35 per cent advantage to high income earners. The Australian Labor Party supported their rich mates through superannuation rorts, something that has been rectified by this government in its first budget and something that should be applauded by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3424">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is that not a new tax, by the way? Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure there would be people in your electorate who, if they wanted to or felt tempted to, would say this is a new tax. It is the same logic the Labor Party is trying to apply today to wholesale sales taxes where they are calling extending a tax to an area that was not previously taxed a new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are they not up here today saying that the budget decision on superannuation for wealthy superannuants who were gaining a huge tax advantage under Keating tax laws&mdash;that is, the government's proposed increase in the budget of 15 per cent&mdash;is a new tax? Is it because it is the wealthy? Do you agree with the concept or were you not prepared to introduce it yourself? Are you throwing off the Keating favouritism for the wealthy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to know from the Australian Labor Party the logic behind the fact that they are not prepared to nominate the reduction of the 15 per cent income tax advantage for high income earning superannuants. Why are you not prepared to brand that as a new tax? You are not branding that as a new tax, yet you are branding this extension of the sales tax on individual vehicles, which is a proper way to collect sales tax, as an extension or a new tax. It just will not wash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to close by saying that this government will stick to its promises. It really does believe that it is time for a change in the ethos, a change in the way in which things are done in Australia. We reject the amendment moved by the opposition spokesman. We regard it as typical of the misleading tactics that are being adopted by the opposition, the lies that they are prepared to tell in order to break down the credibility of the government. The government is not going to have its credibility broken down by people making blatant assertions that are so falsely and completely wrong.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in favour of this sales tax bill and support the contentions of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who, in my opinion, is fast becoming one of the foremost authorities on tax matters in this place. A little earlier this year, the people of Australia were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> given a sneak preview, at that notorious June Premiers Conference, of the fondness of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) for performing financial tricks with smoke and mirrors, as the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) has alluded to. That smoke and mirrors trick was an ability that he displayed so eloquently in last night's budget, as well as he displayed his enormous ability to land himself offside with his own side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I continue to refer to that June Premiers Conference, which the member for Mitchell described as successful. When the Treasurer waltzed in on that occasion to show the state leaders who the boss was by dumping on them the proposal to abolish the sales tax exemptions, the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, led other premiers in making it very clear&mdash;if I can use canine parlance&mdash;that Mr Costello was barking up the wrong tree and that, if it was his idea to foster a close working relationship with the states, the Treasurer ought to be brought to heel on that initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Costello said before the election that he would not bulk up existing taxes, yet that is exactly what occurred in last night's budget. Existing taxes have been&mdash;in the pre&hyphen;election words of the Treasurer&mdash;bulked up. There is no doubt that this rather paltry bill that is before the House is all that could be salvaged from the Treasurer's ill-fated foray into his own world of mismanaged financial diplomacy which he inflicted on us all but, in particular, upon the state premiers at that conference back in June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa has in some detail outlined some of the broken promises that have been perpetrated on the Australian electorate by the Howard government in its first few months, and I suggest we were presented with many more such broken promises in last night's budget. I could go into some of those at length. I could go into those which go to child care, education, older Australians, health and labour market programs&mdash;all of which, it was claimed pre-election, would be maintained by the current government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any detailed examination of the rest of those promises, I am sure, will be saved for another day and gone over with a fine toothed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3425"> comb by my colleagues on this side of the House. However, I would like to allude briefly to and highlight a few instances to show that the government's proposed amendments to sales tax laws are not so much an example of one-off errant behaviour, but rather compelling evidence of the government's pathological inability to keep its word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states, as I have mentioned, will have to bear a fairly overwhelming legacy of the Treasurer's fiasco at that June Premiers Conference through the loss of more than $1.5 billion in payments to states through the allocation of financial assistance grants over the next three years. That will no doubt be a legacy that will impact very heavily on the lives and opportunities of ordinary Australians. There is no doubt that most states have had to consider introducing a range of new taxes to offset their own funding shortfall&mdash;the impost which was forced upon them by the government at that charade and shambles of a Premiers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, cuts to specific purpose payments to the states will also impact most severely on the services most utilised by ordinary working men and women of Australia. I refer to the HACC scheme, the home and community care scheme, which provides programs for both the elderly and the disabled in our community by incorporating within its programs and services Meals on Wheels, the home maintenance program, community transport arrangements, and home help services. For a government to claim that it was elected on a platform of caring for the needy and the poor, the cut to the home and community care program is indeed another example of what is a very clear breach of an equally clear and explicit campaign promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways our supporting this bill is not the first occasion when my colleagues and I have been willing to support the government's fairly convoluted and disjointed efforts to reform the tax system. Not long ago the opposition did the government a favour and, in fact, I was one of the speakers&mdash;as was, again, that notable tax authority, the member for Werriwa&mdash;on the issue pertaining to another coalition broken tax promise, that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being their refusal to amend the provisional tax uplift factor for further out than one year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the coalition's policy launch statement of February this year&mdash;I think it was page 21 of that document&mdash;the coalition's promises and approach to small business were set out again quite explicitly. Included on that same page 21 was this clear promise which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent at a one&hyphen;off cost of $180 million.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition, of course, during the campaign at that time made great play and put great emphasis and weight on its promise to change the provisional tax uplift factor from six to eight per cent. In many ways it led us to believe that that was something that would be done in perpetuity; that it would be achieved this year and implemented in forthcoming years&mdash;certainly well on into the mid&hyphen;term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This  would have been, of course, a great boon to self&hyphen;funded retirees and provisional taxpayers, not to mention the small business sector on whose behalf the coalition claims to act and which, it claims, is its primary constituency. But both the Treasurer and Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the question of small business had publicly stated at that time that an essential and core part of its package during the campaign was the revamp of that provisional uplift factor, and the positive impact, it alleged, that it would have on small business. That was made perfectly clear in both the Prime Minister's and Treasurer's statements, as well as the coalition's policy document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That reduction in the provisional tax uplift rate from eight per cent to six per cent was, as I say, to be a permanent measure. Nowhere was there any mention of the significant component of their campaign strategy, particularly as far as small business and self&hyphen;funded retirees went. Nowhere was there any mention of that occurring only in the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year. The coalition's position as far as the perception that it keenly fostered for itself amongst its beloved small business community was clear and unequivocal: it would be changing the provisional tax uplift factor in perpetuity. There was no mention of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3426"> one year; this was something that was to be done on a permanent basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we were presented with a bill which altered the uplift factor for the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year, but made no mention of the change to the uplift factor in future years. Nor did it reset&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YK6">Mr WILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. Nor did it reset the default rate at a lower figure than is presently the case. So what we had then was an attempt by the government to have it both ways: to have a bit this way, and a bit that way on this particular promise. On the one hand, it claimed to have honoured its promises to provisional taxpayers to reduce this uplift factor and simultaneously, on the other hand, it had found a convenient way to weasel out of its commitment by legislating that change for one year only. And then it had the audacity to claim that that was its policy all along.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We claim that that was a hoodwinking of the Australian electorate. It was a fairly deceitful act that was perpetrated on the electorate at that time. I made the point then&mdash;and it still appals me now&mdash;that this government's priorities are all too clear. Both its proclaiming of its Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996, and workplace relations bill are two examples of its keeping of its promises. Both of these policies are highly destructive, and highly divisive within what has hitherto been a fairly cohesive Australian community. We have seen just how divisive its policies have been this week in respect of the industrial relations bill  when there was a very peaceful and effective demonstration, for most part, conducted some 100 or so metres from the front steps of Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it seems that issues of fundamental importance, such as maintaining the availability of quality education, are those on which the government seems to have no qualms about in going back on its word. There has been considerable comment also from the government throughout its short life of the need to reform our taxation system. Those on my side, contrary to what the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Mitchell may have said, have a fine history and a fine track record of reform in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When in government, through the introduction of both fringe benefits and capital gains taxes, we sought changes to the taxation of companies and, simultaneously, a decrease in tax rates, particularly as they apply to PAYE taxpayers. As I have alluded to, in opposition we have already supported a number of bills aimed at further reforming and refining our taxation system. We shall do so again by accepting this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about reforming our tax system we talk of genuine reform. We do not talk about doubling at the margin. We do not talk about superficialities or perfunctory amendments, many of which the government has sought to impose on the tax system. We seek genuine taxation reform. It is fair to say that when the coalition talks about tax reform it talks in code. It does not talk about genuine tax reform; it is tax reform in code.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 was introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 27 June. It sets out to remove the wholesale sales tax exemption currently enjoyed by all levels of government in connection with motor vehicles and parts where they are provided wholly or partly for private use in the pursuance of the employment of employees of government bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vehicles which are infrequently or irregularly used for private purposes will still be sales tax exempt. This affects most government cars that are part of a pool or are government plated. Although the federal government is at pains to highlight that all levels of government will be affected by the measure, the reality is that it is a blatant attempt by the government to squeeze additional revenue from state and local governments. The government estimates that this measure will provide additional revenue of some $50 to $100 million in 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the method by which this decision was arrived at and its ramifications which lead, naturally enough, to a range of issues which also need to be resolved. Amongst them is the process of the Premiers Conference, the need for a thorough review of the taxing powers and the split of revenue between Commonwealth and the state, and the ability of the states to continue bailing out to some large extent&mdash;admittedly, a greater extent under the previous Labor government than under the present one so far on present indications&mdash;the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process surrounding the last Premiers Conference was, to most people who observed the goings on, a complete and utter farce. The Treasurer (Mr Costello), prior to the conference and without any consultation with the states, proposed an extraordinarily ridiculous scheme to lift the exemption of state and local governments from sales tax right across the board. To do so, they employed a much used tactic of their Labor predecessors and announced their intentions and intended to write tax law by press release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was announced in the first place would have resulted in public schools and hospitals having to pay sales tax also. I am sure there are members in this House who are only too well aware of that. Not only would that have impacted on state government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3428"> budgets but it would also have resulted in further cost cutting in essential areas by the states. Poor quality education and health services arguably would have resulted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obvious now&mdash;it should have been obvious at the time&mdash;that the Treasurer's position was not thoroughly thought through. He totally misjudged the political consequences . Amongst other things he gave the premier of Victoria an opportunity and a reason to get into the tax debate. I know there is a bit of animosity between the premier of Victoria and the Treasurer, and the premier of Victoria was not too slow to arrive at the conclusion that if it is good enough for the Treasurer to propose treating the states in that particular way it is good enough for him to get involved in the debate on tax reform and the adoption of a value added tax of some sort or another. So it is no surprise that the Premiers, led by Mr Kennett, got stuck into the Treasurer's plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only thing the Treasurer's statement seemed to achieve&mdash;I am being kind enough to assume that there must have been a strategy behind his approach to this matter&mdash;was the bringing together of the premiers to devise an alternative method of saving the Commonwealth $1.2 billion a year. Unfortunately, the end result was that the states have yet again been forced to come to the federal government's fiscal rescue. Every year&mdash;under Labor it was never more evident&mdash;we have witnessed the Commonwealth squeeze the states even further. I must say that I had hoped the coalition would act in this area with more integrity, though what we have seen so far is not promising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that the federal government has started tinkering with the tax system, and in the way that it impacts on the states, it cannot easily resist calls for a review of the tax system and the sharing of government tax receipts. As Mr Ian Davis reported on the Premiers Conference when he wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 15 June 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Howard government's failed attempt to extend sales tax to state, territory and local governments at this weekend's premiers' conference ensured tax reform would be an issue at the next federal election," Victoria's premier, Jeff Kennett, said after yesterday's meeting. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Commonwealth had put it on the agenda by raising it going into this week's premiers' conference and could now remove it," he said.</PARA>
<PARA>The Premier of Victoria and the Western Australian Premier have some justification in asking for a review of the tax system, and the action of the Treasurer was undoubtedly the catalyst. The states have, over the past 13 or more years, been constantly undermined by the Commonwealth government of the day, reducing the ability of the states to raise taxes and fund their own programs. The federal compact has, in the process, been continually undermined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The revenue raising and revenue sharing arrangements of the states and Commonwealth do need to be reviewed as does, most importantly, the allocation of responsibilities. At the time of the drafting of the constitution, the states agreed to a division of the powers between the Commonwealth and the states. Some powers were to be the exclusive preserve of the Commonwealth, some were to be concurrent, and the residual powers were to be the preserve of the states. The so-called federal compact to which the states originally agreed was a very different arrangement to that which now prevails. There has been no significant change in the constitution itself to warrant that, so we have to look in other places for the reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Change over almost 100 years is certainly inevitable, but the continuing march of the Commonwealth to increase its powers at the expense of the states has been relentless&mdash;more relentless, I might add, over the past 13 or so years. At various stages in our national history the pursuit of increased powers by the Commonwealth has been a deliberate policy objective. The Commonwealth's grab for a uniform income tax system during the Second World War, using the wartime powers of the constitution, was a sensible decision in a time of war, but it laid the foundations of the current vertical fiscal imbalance that we witness in Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition purports to support a federal system in which federal and state powers are distributed to encourage participation and to act as an effective barrier against centralist and remote control. The problem arises when <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3429"> state governments do not have the means to tax on their behalf and meet their own expenditures entirely or largely out of revenue they raise themselves. This is the problem the states are currently suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states are reliant on tied Commonwealth grants, which are continually being cut, for a large part of their revenue. They were cut yet again at the most recent Premiers Conference, and they are the figures in the budget that we saw brought down last night. A position paper of the premiers and chief ministers dated May 1992, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth-state financial arrangements</EMPHASIS> states, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The negative impact of the reduction in Commonwealth payments to the states cannot be overemphasised. Since 1982-83, Commonwealth own purpose outlays have increased by 35.5 per cent in real terms, compared with a reduction of 1.7 per cent for the Commonwealth payments to the states. Until 1989-90, the effect of this financial squeeze on state budgets was cushioned by revenue growth resulting from the one-off speculative boom in asset prices. Only since this speculative bubble has burst has the underlying financial position of the states been exposed.</PARA>
<PARA>That was back in 1992 and not much has changed since then. Increases in federal own purpose outlays reveal the budget surpluses of the mid-1980s for what they actually were. They were not the result of the then Labor government's cutting back its own outlays, but were the outcome of a fiscally lax administration that passed on all cuts in Commonwealth government expenditure to the states by reduced grants. That was the main reason they were able to get into surplus. The states paid for the budget surpluses of the 1980s, of which Labor was so proud for such a short time, and redemption of debt by the states was thereby delayed. Now the coalition appears to be adopting the same or a very similar approach to that of Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easier for the Commonwealth to cut grants to the states rather than to reduce the amount of its own outlays&mdash;it is much easier. This passes the problem for cutting net government outlays onto the states. The states thereby have to cut their outlays to meet the falling level of federal grants or raise taxes and charges. Of course the states have the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> most limited opportunity of raising taxes because they suffer from a narrow tax base which is gradually diminishing but, above all, is extremely regressive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only bright spot for most states is the increasing revenue from casinos and gaming machines. I know there is no such thing as a moral tax but if there is a more immoral tax than that which is raised from casinos and gaming machines I can only think of one or two examples and I will not mention them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To highlight the impact of the Commonwealth's slashing of grants to the states, Claude Forell in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 26 February 1992 wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And if the Keating government had been willing to allocate grants to the states on the same formula as the Fraser government used in the early 1980s, Victoria would have been $2 billion the richer and finished the year with a budget surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Keating government has been deliberately slashing state funding for more than strictly economic reasons. In the name of national priorities and with the arrogant assumption that Canberra knows best, it has been trying to reduce the states to little more than agents or contractors of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>Subsequent to that, Premier Goss made statements along the same lines. It is obvious that Labor was furthering its central agenda by depriving the states of the means to pursue new programs or even to maintain current levels of service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the reason the coalition seems to be following suit, though? It may not be a centralist agenda, but it is a thoroughly unprincipled grab for additional revenue and cost cutting at the expense of the states. The position of the Australian states compared to that of other states in federations in other countries is worth examining, if only briefly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The special Premiers Conference of October 1990 initiated a review of the financial arrangements between the levels of government in the Australian federation to determine whether existing arrangements could be changed to enable governments to govern better in this country. This report is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxation and the fiscal imbalance between the levels of the Australian government</EMPHASIS>. I think it was released in October 1991.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3430">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to this report, Germany and Canada have both achieved near vertical fiscal balance. Whereas in Australia the states only raise 40 per cent of their outlays by taxation, in Canada and Germany this figure is 90 per cent and in the United States it is 130 per cent. In other words, the states that comprise the United States of America raise 30 per cent more of the total tax they need and they subsidise their central government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conversely in Australia, the federal government raises 130 per cent of its outlays with the figure being 100 per cent in Canada and Germany and 90 per cent in the United States. In Germany, the laender, the equivalent of states, are entitled to a constitutionally guaranteed share of income tax and have agreement with the federal government on a set share of consumption tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian states deserve similar treatment but at the very worst much better treatment. The fact is that better administration occurs where governments raise the money they spend. Kenneth Davidson on 26 March 1994 in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complexity of the federal system, which obscures which level of government is really responsible for various services, confuses the electorate and promotes irresponsible government.</PARA>
<PARA>An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 24 February 1994 which discusses state taxation powers states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But there is also a powerful logic in the argument that if we want the states to be more responsible and accountable, they should not be so constrained by a big brother approach.</PARA>
<PARA>John Stone in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  of 8 August 1992 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is raising more than 50 per cent above its needs. That is then transferred to the states often with strings attached. This detachment of  spending from revenue has caused a failure by both federal and state bureaucracies to behave responsibly. If raising money and spending it were done by the same government, the government would be more responsible.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Other respectable analysts have made like&hyphen;minded comments, of course. Clearly there is a need for the states to have secure access to a source or sources of revenue which they can outlay as they deem fit and proper. This could occur either through some form of tax shar <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ing, as in Germany, by the states increasing existing taxes or, possibly, by the Commonwealth giving the states access to, say, excise and sales taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever the answer, it is not desirable for the states to try to bridge the gap between current receipts and outlays only by increasing the taxes now available to them. The current tax bases of the states are too narrow and inelastic and will not grow as rapidly as the economy grows. They will lag behind growth in the economy as a general rule. State taxes are also highly concentrated on business inputs which distort business decision making and competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time for the national tax system to be reviewed, notwithstanding the jibes of members of the opposition who want to raise and reraise the bogy of a goods and services tax or a like tax. They have got a bit of gall, really, when you think about it. The previous Prime Minister and the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), as Minister for Finance, were to financial responsibility what Yasuo Hamanaka is to price stability and the orderly marketing of copper in international markets. The Treasurer, though, and his government cannot and should not continue to look to the states to provide their expenditure cuts. That has happened all too frequently in the immediate past. Commonwealth expenditure is where the cuts must be found and I am pleased to see in the budget brought down last night that at least a start is to be made in that direction, although there is still an element of cuts in states'&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.10 p.m.)&mdash;in reply&mdash;First of all, in winding up this part of the debate, could I say thanks to those people who have contributed to the debate: the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a few comments in regard to the speech given by the member for Curtin. Obviously the member for Curtin is a person who is well respected in this parliament for his comments on taxation. There are just a couple of areas which I would comment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3431"> on. I am sure that the people involved in the processes and methods of discussion and preparation between the federal government and the states are conscious of the need for a process which advances discussion between both the states and the Commonwealth in regard to taxation matters. I am sure that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is conscious of the importance of those processes taking place in an orderly and constructive manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member also referred in particular to state and Commonwealth relationships, the different levels of taxation which exist between the Commonwealth as compared with the states and the need for vertical fiscal balance. Again, I am sure that in that area the government is conscious of the need for discussion and the need to look at taxation generally. Certainly I think the contribution by the member for Curtin to the debate was very constructive and other people learned from his contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to make some comments about the members of the opposition who have used this debate to bring forward an amendment which we as a government disagree with. Really, they do have a hide to come in here and talk about broken promises&mdash;an absolute hide. Last night we had a budget brought down in this place. Nine months ago the then government was saying that we were going to have a surplus of $718 million. This is what we found when we opened up the books: first of all, on 12 March we got information from Treasury of $7.6 billion and, of course, now we know that has stretched out to over $10 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Treasurer said, we did not cause this problem. We did not cause the problem that Australia is faced with, but what we can tell the opposition is that we will take the responsibility for fixing the problem. The member for Werriwa comes in here and spends time lecturing us about broken promises and all the rest of it when there is a great litany of broken promises by the former government. I remind people about some of those broken promises. Maybe the problem was that the previous Prime Minister spent too much time hiding in the Prime Minister's office. You <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were the people who were behind him and created him as the leader.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to look at the receipts of the last four years. In this budget, the increase in receipts this year is the lowest for the last four years. It is something that is quite distinctive. I guess this follows on from what the member for Curtin was saying; that is, one of the things which this government has done is, in a Commonwealth sense, cut expenditure itself. Whereas the previous government, when it was in power and wanted to get things into balance, increased taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings us to the point which was made by the member for Mitchell&mdash;that there would be no new taxes. `There will be no new taxes' is what we were told by the Keating government. We were told not only that but that it was l-a-w, that is, it was written in law. The previous Prime Minister went to that extent. Maybe he was on ginseng at that time and bouncing on the trampoline when he thought it out; maybe that is what it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said there would be no new taxes. What did we find in regard to no new taxes? Instead of cutting taxes by $14 billion, which he committed himself to do in the 1993 election campaign, what did he do? He subjected us to a $13.4 billion increase in taxes. That is what he said. There were increases. For example, wholesale sales tax increased by two per cent. It went from 20 per cent up to 22 per cent. There was an increase in petrol taxes. Remember? Taxes on leaded and unleaded petrol increased by 7c and 5c respectively. He said there were not going to be any new taxes. He said there would be no new taxes, and he put up taxes on tobacco.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go back to the budget for 1995-96, again, what did he do there? He increased the Medicare levy from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent. He increased taxes on motor vehicles by six per cent. They went up to 15 per cent and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3432"> then up to 21 per cent and then up to 22 per cent. He increased company tax and tobacco tax. Of course, he also tried to impose a tax on the family home through a hardware tax. That is the record of the previous government, yet you come in here and talk to us about taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the particular matter which is before the House, basically what the opposition is saying is that it is all right for people who are employed in government positions, in local government and so forth, to have cars and to use them fairly freely so that government bodies can actually buy them wholesale sales tax free and for them to get the benefits of it. That is basically a rort. It is like so many areas which the previous government had in the taxation system&mdash;complicated, difficult and riddled with rorts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one way in which we can deliver to ordinary Australians a fair balance in regard to this area of taxation. Not only that, of course, this taxation measure which we are debating here today is one which was agreed to by the state governments and the Commonwealth. It is a measure which is important for the government to earn its revenue and so forth. As I said right at the beginning, we did not cause this problem, but we are taking the responsibility to fix it as a government. You created the problem. You left us with massive financial problems in this country. Of course, now you are trying to back and fill when the people have rejected you as a possible government again. They totally rejected you back on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose in some sense the way in which the Labor government managed the financial situation of Australia over the last three or four years is a bit like the ACTU managing the rally out there on Monday. It is very similar&mdash;totally out of control and with no real idea as to where it was going. That is exactly what happened on Monday with the ACTU. To a large extent, the opposition ought to be called the ACTU opposition because that is what they largely are&mdash;people out of the ACTU union movement. That is the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in regard to this particular legislation, we do have the national interest at heart, and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we do have the national interest in focus. We will be taking action so that the taxation measures, which are needed for this country to make sure that the budget has come back into surplus and back into balance in a reasonable period of time, will be achieved. This is one of the measures which will help achieve it. We oppose the amendment which has been put forward by the member for Werriwa and we support the original motion.</PARA>

<PARA>This bill, like the Costello budget, reflects a litany, an absolute multitude, of broken tax promises and betrayals in the eyes of Australian taxpayers. It is interesting to listen to government members talking today about the way in which the budget has been received in their electorates. It is interesting indeed to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) talking about the so&hyphen;called family tax package. It is interesting indeed to compare that rhetoric and the reception the budget will really receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Budget Paper No. 1 at 4&hyphen;28 shows that on income tax this government and this Costello budget will collect $5&half; billion additional tax compared to the last budget of the Keating government. That is a 9.1 per cent increase. Where is the family tax relief in an additional $5&half; billion collection of income tax? Where is the family tax relief for a 9.1 per cent increase in income tax revenue collection? The truth is that, for every $100 the taxpayers paid in their tax to the Keating government, they will be paying $109.10 to the Howard government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the truth regarding the impact of taxation policy and broken tax promises on the Australian public.

There is no relief, no gain, just all pain and betrayal on those taxation broken promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government has shown and what this bill reflects is that this is a government much more of taxes than axes&mdash;a lot of axing but a lot more taxing. The Treasurer has shown he is much more a taxer than an axer. We do not oppose the provisions in this legislation, but we do oppose dishonesty in public life.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> My amendment lists them, chapter and verse. It lists the detail of these broken tax promises. It lists the change in the tariff concession system so that businesses will have to pay higher taxes on a greater range of their inputs, raising $300 million in revenue. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tour ism (Mr Moore) said that those changes reflect a tax, and the tax is an increase in collections of $300 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment reflects the broken tax promise by way of the increase in the Medicare levy&mdash;the fact that this government said it would not change Medicare. It said it would not introduce new taxes, but here is an increase in the Medicare levy that introduces in Australia a two&hyphen;tier health system, just as the government has introduced a two&hyphen;tier higher education system. One rule for the rich and one rule for the poor. For the rich, private health insurance in the private system; for the poor, the public system and the running down of public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment reflects the government's failure to reduce the uplift factor on provisional tax for more than one year, for more than 1996&hyphen;97 alone. It is surprising indeed that the government is not reflecting in its budget estimates the legislation of the parliament, because we had a lengthy debate just a few months ago about the uplift factor on provisional tax. This House, through Labor Party amendments in the Senate and here, introduced the formula by which, for the out years, provisional tax could be estimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see on page 1&hyphen;19 of Budget Statement No. 1, regarding the major revenue measures, that the uplift factor on provisional tax is $180 million revenue forgone in 1996&hyphen;97. But for the out years, 1997&hyphen;98 and beyond, there is nothing but a dash in the budget papers. That reflects a broken tax promise, because this was a government that said, with regard to the uplift factor on provisional tax, that it would go down to six per cent; not six per cent for one year only, but six per cent across the term of the parliament. It was a promise of six per cent full stop, not a promise of six per cent qualified, for one year only. Yet we find in the budget papers that the funding for the uplift factor is for 1996&hyphen;97 alone&mdash;$180 million. That is an outright betrayal of the government's tax promise.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt whatsoever that, with regard to the uplift factor on provisional tax, despite all the things said in question time today, the government is not delivering on its full promise. It is not delivering the $180 million benefit for three years. It is a sunset provision&mdash;one year only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth broken promise that is listed in the amendment, which relates directly to the bill, is the decision to levy a 15 per cent superannuation surcharge. This is not necessarily a measure that the Labor Party opposes or which, when it is introduced into the House, we will necessarily be voting against. We do not oppose the provision as much as we oppose the dishonesty, the betrayal, the deceit behind the provision itself. It was the Treasurer, supported by the Prime Minister throughout the election campaign, who said, `It is not our agenda to introduce new taxes.' Every single coalition person sitting in this House supported that commitment&mdash;no new taxes. He went on to say, `It is not our agenda to bulk up currently existing taxes.' Yet here <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we have the superannuation tax being bulked up with a 15 per cent surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a blatant broken promise, a clear instance of betrayal of the people of Australia, who thought that the Howard government would be true to its word. For all of those people who voted on tax measures, for all of those people who thought this government would implement its policies, they have been betrayed. They have been betrayed because the government is constantly bulking up currently existing taxes. It is bulking up on superannuation; it is bulking up on income tax&mdash;$5&half; billion in extra collections in 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is bulking up on the indirect taxes, bulking up on the Medicare levy, bulking up across the board with each of these tax measures. Of course, the Australian people should not have to tolerate that, because if there was one thing the Prime Minister said that he would do above all else it was that he would keep his promises. You can imagine their disappointment with this budget and this particular piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gets worse. The fifth item in the amendment notes increased tax collections in 1996-97. They are up by $8.6 billion or 4.5 per cent in real terms, and then a further $7.8 billion or 3.4 per cent in real terms in 1997-98. The increased income tax on individuals is $5&half; billion or 9.1 per cent, approximately 6.4 per cent in real terms. There is an increased tax revenue from 23.9 per cent GDP in 1995-96 to 24.3 per cent GDP in 1996-97. Where is the tax relief? Where is the family tax relief when tax revenue collection as a proportion of GDP is going up by almost half a per cent? There is no tax relief when tax collections are growing as a share of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sixth item in the amendment notes the introduction of major revenue measures in the 1996-97 budget, with a net impact of $979 million and a further net impact of almost $2 billion in the financial year 1997-98. That impact, on average for the Australian taxpayer, is more than $260 over the next two financial years for every single Australian taxpayer&mdash;a clear instance of a broken tax promise. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You promised smaller government. You have got tax collections going up by 0.4 per cent of GDP in your first budget. Then they go up and up; and, on the projections, they stay there. The Chief Government Whip, the member for Mitchell, has spent a lot of time out of the chamber today. I look forward to the revolt on the government benches against this big taxing budget really taking hold. I look forward to the revolt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those people who think that there are votes in smaller government, if that is the case, should be going back to their electorates and finding out the level of discontent by talking to income tax payers about the $5.5 billion extra, talking to taxpayers who have to fund the $8.6 billion increase in tax collections in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier today, the Prime Minister in question time was waving around a few newspaper headlines. The truth is that, when it comes to taxation matters, there is only one headline that matters, and that is `Up Up Up'. Tax is going up for income; tax is going up for the Medicare levy; tax is going up on superannuation; tax is going up on the sales tax regime&mdash;tax is going up across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board. That is the lasting message of John Howard's performance on tax&mdash;up, up, up; betrayal, betrayal, betrayal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message on these matters will take hold. It normally takes a few weeks for the press gallery to get a true picture of a budget and for these measures to start to unravel. All those government members who wander through their electorates saying that there is family tax relief will understand, and their constituents will understand, that that is not the case. That is not the case when income tax is rising so savagely, when tax promises are being broken hand over fist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I would like to see the House support the amendment. I would like to see government members have a serious look at the amend ment and actually read their budget documents. I refer them to just one page in Budget Statement No. 1, page 1-19. They should have a look at the major revenue measures of this government, at the things they promised before the election and what they have delivered on the major revenue collections of the Commonwealth. Those members will be ashamed of the level of deceit and betrayal that this first Costello budget reflects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some other important issues need to be raised in debate. They concern some of the detail of this legislation. The government promised before the election to increase the exemption amount on FBT to $100 for small items. That is a measure, a promise, that thankfully the government is keeping&mdash;one of the few on taxation measures. It is an initiative that the Parliamentary Labor Party is pleased to support. But our job on these things is, as you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, to keep them extra honest. A government that takes so trivially its own mandate needs to be kept honest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair indeed to see that exemption on FBT indexed. If $100 is the appropriate amount in 1996-97, why should it not be indexed against movements in inflation? If $100 is good for 1996-97, then the $100 plus CPI is good for 1997-98 and beyond, financial year after financial year. If this government is serious about its rhetoric for small business it will support that amendment. It is a positive initiative of the Labor Party to say if the exemption on FBT is to be applied then let us apply it year after year, indexation period after indexation period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with interest that in the budget papers that promise of relief for small business on the FBT is not even quantified in the budget documents. There is nothing in here that talks about revenue forgone to the Commonwealth, nothing in Budget Statement No. 1 that identifies any revenue forgone. So maybe this is only a minor matter. The government certainly cannot argue that the Labor Party is being fiscally irresponsible if it cannot quantify in its own budget the amount of revenue that we are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is a sensible amendment. I commend it to the House along with the second reading <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3438"> amendment that I have moved. I will be seeking the call at the consideration stage to further examine the FBT provision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). Amendments to taxation bills are very commonplace in this chamber. Bills which makes things better, simpler, fairer and less complicated for individuals, families and business of all sizes, particularly small businesses, must be supported. As I travel around the electorate of Petrie and speak to many small business people, I find that compliance costs, fringe benefits tax and taxation are areas of great debate and interest. Many complain of a somewhat complicated system, the Australian taxation system, and wish that it would be a lot simpler. However, when I speak to those who want to make a go of it out there in the community, I believe that this government is taking the right direction and certainly will continue to do so in favour of business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been discussed, the bill amends many areas which have become fundamental parts of business&mdash;commercial debt and the extended use of tax file numbers for superannuation purposes to further streamline superannuation administration. The bill also examines offshore banking units. Labor has for many years managed to sink small business into a sea of red tape and paperwork. In the bill the repeal section 261 will simplify loan documentation for the banking industry. More particularly, the area which I wish to address, schedule 5 amendments of the Fringe Tax Amendment Act 1986, paragraph 58P, deals specifically with fringe benefits tax exemption for small benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key points of the fringe benefits tax adjustment need to be noted and understood. The bill will in effect double the FBT minor benefits exemption. The amendments will allow for fringe benefits of less than $100 to qualify for exemption under FBT as long as they meet the conditions as set aside and as mentioned and relate to compliance costs. The amendment will also ensure that employers who provide irregular minor benefits of less <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than $100 will avoid paying FBT all together. Now employers can assist further in ensuring the spirit and harmony of the workplace by acknowledging special achievements such as long-term value, productivity and contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before the House is another instalment in the government's ongoing strategy to streamline the operation of the taxation system with strong focus on providing small business with a less onerous regime and will enable incentives to invest and grow. It is true to say that FBT exemption to $100 will ensure that the compliance burden of this tax will ease on small business. Small business is the prime generator of jobs in the economy. It is a very important sector for the people of Petrie and for their community spirit and expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous government we had a system that was all mixed up and that had the wrong elements. FBT was a system that was costly to administer, time consuming and costly to comply with. I had the privilege of coming to Canberra some years ago when the government introduced a fringe benefits tax to the restaurant industry. It devastated that industry. Nowhere in the world does one have to calculate fringe benefits tax on entertainment in such a complicated way as we do in Australia. One gets a headache just working out the fringe benefits component of a meal where clients are taken to lunch. It is one of the things we have to thank the previous government for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment has left small businesses battling for very long hours with pen, paper, calculator and a bundle of forms just to provide some benefit to employees and to keep their heads above water. When it comes to small business, time is money, and more time sweating on paperwork can mean lost opportunities out there in the marketplace. The costs of the FBT have been disproportionate to the value of the goods and services provided and the revenue flow to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most important measures of the new government has been the small business deregulation task force. Lynda Dean, a small businesswoman who is a very valued member <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3439"> of that group, has described the fringe benefits tax as an `absolute nightmare of complexity' where, at times, the cost of compliance far outweighs the amount of tax to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, these changes are part of the government's platform. Small businesses for so long struggled under the pressures and burdens placed on them by the previous government, and now the Howard government's initiatives are giving them a second chance. They are being given a second chance to make their businesses viable, to employ people and to provide quality, competition and cost-effectiveness to our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is in its first six months, and it has already made some substantial inroads into providing avenues of sustainable management and opportunity&mdash;something that the previous government could not achieve with such complicated business measures. Furthermore, this government, through the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, will pursue the issue of aligning the FBT and income tax years. That is a very rational and commonsense option and one that the government is prepared to review and propose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Small Business Deregulation Task Force was established by the government to examine compliance costs and the impacts on small business of government regulations and statistical requirements. It has been known in some instances for compliance costs for some taxes to be as high as 10 per cent of the total revenue collected. This government wishes to rectify this situation, and it is at last placing the pieces into place. The work of the deregulation task force is yet another election commitment enforced and a key plank in getting businesses working again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is looking forward to the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force&mdash;which is due on 1 November 1996&mdash;for its recommendations on revenue neutral measures which will ease the paperwork and compliance on small businesses. The task force is consulting widely in the community at the moment, and I expect they will deliver some very sound recommendations for a more equitable and cost-effective tax regime. As part of the government's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy initiatives before the election, we also highlighted simplifying the rules in relation to entertainment and parking, and this will certainly come under the jurisdiction of the task force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also established a micro business consulting group which will network and advise the government on the specific policy requirements of this very important section of the small business community. These moves will take the pressure off small businesses&mdash;businesses which are still reeling from the gut wrenching interest rate rises throughout the early 1990s under the previous Labor government. The people of Petrie and the businesses of Petrie deserve to have some optimism put back into their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I sat in the chamber today, I was quite astounded at some of the comments made by the opposition, particularly by the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) when he referred to the `peaceful demonstration' that occurred two days ago at Parliament House. I must be living in another country. If that was a peaceful demonstration, what does Bosnia look like? It was absolutely amazing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Isaacs also spoke about economic reform and how the Labor government was much better at economic reform. Where is this economic reform that he spoke of so freely? It certainly was not administered in the previous government. Also we had the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) talking about broken promises. He sounded very much like a broken record himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government was in power in 1993. Do opposition members remember that year? It was a very good year for broken promises and increased taxes, including wholesale sales taxes and petrol taxes. A number of members have outlined them in detail, and I will not go through them again. I am sure it is very painful for you to remember that particular year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 amends the taxation and superannuation laws in a number of significant ways. It was introduced into the House by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). I commend him for his fortitude today, because he seems to have been in the House for most of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill gives effect to a coalition election promise concerning the fringe benefits tax. It also deals with some outstanding legislative matters from the previous parliament which need to be addressed to relieve uncertainty in the business and taxpaying community. The bill deals with several matters, including forgiveness of commercial debt, extended use of tax file numbers for superannuation purposes, an exemption in the fringe benefits tax for minor benefits with a value less than $100, offshore banking units, the repeal of section 261 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, pooled superannuation trusts and deductions for gifts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 1 of schedule 1 amends the ITAA 1936 to extend the scope of the offshore banking unit&mdash;and I will refer to that as OBU&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concessional tax regime and exempts from interest withholding tax gold fees paid by OBUs as part of gold borrowings. This amendment also allows the borrowing and lending of Australian currency between related OBUs and denies an income tax deduction for foreign tax paid by OBUs where a foreign tax credit is also available because of the operation of a double tax treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax act provides tax concessions for income derived by an OBU from offshore banking activities&mdash;and I will refer to that as OB. These concessions have the effect that the income derived by an OBU from OB activities is taxed at an effective rate of 10 per cent. These tax concessions are designed to facilitate the growth of Australia as a viable offshore banking centre, and thus the development of Australia as a significant international financial centre. These amendments relating to OBUs are beneficial to the operation of OBUs and will actually result in a minimal cost to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 2 of schedule 1 of this bill will allow complying superannuation funds and complying approved deposit funds&mdash;ADFs&mdash;to claim deductions for expenses relating to investments in pooled superannuation trusts and life assurance policies issued by life assurance companies and registered organisations. Part 4 of schedule 1 repeals section 261 of the ITAA 1936, as I have already mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 261 operates to make void any covenant or stipulation in a mortgage which has or purports to have the purpose or effect of imposing on a mortgagor the obligation of paying income tax on the interest to be paid under that mortgage. Some offshore loan agreements provided for the complete protection of lenders against withholding tax and other taxes which affect the return to the lender. Typically, gross&hyphen;up clauses are included in such agreements which provide that, if taxes are required to be deducted, the borrower is obliged to pay additional amounts so that the lender receives the full amount due to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 261 has had the unintended consequence of applying to make void typical gross&hyphen;up clauses in offshore loan agreements. Therefore, it needed to be repealed. Like the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3441"> offshore banking unit provision, this measure is beneficial in terms of reducing the costs associated with offshore banking activities. This is essential if Australia is to grow further as a viable&mdash;and I emphasise `viable'&mdash;offshore banking centre and as a significant international financial centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Singapore is considered to be Australia's largest competitor in that regard. However, Australia is starting behind the eight ball, as it were, because several factors are against us. Singapore has a more competitive tax regime. For example, dividends paid to residents from OBU activities are tax free. Singapore is better located in terms of its time zone&mdash;unless you are from Western Australia, of course, as I am&mdash;so it is better able to facilitate a 24&hyphen;hour market by conducting business when the Hong Kong and Tokyo markets have just closed and the London market has not yet opened. Finally, Australia has probably entered the field too late to become a major player, though some growth should be expected and the potential of that growth should be encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As usual, Australia moved too slowly in the 1980s, which happens to coincide with the term of the previous Labor government, in freeing up the operating environment of offshore financial activities. In the early 1980s, Labor deregulated the financial markets&mdash;and most of us supported that&mdash;yet did not have the foresight to place Australia in a competitive position to promote Australia as a major financial centre for the Asia-Pacific region. We are labouring, if you will excuse the pun, as a result of that. Labor acted too slowly and only realised its mistake in the last few years with measures such as those in the One Nation and Innovation statements that it issued without very great effect, I am sorry to say. By this stage the competition had already left us miles behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 1 of schedule 2 deals with the forgiveness of commercial debt, and I might say more about that in the detail stage. This matter was originally covered in Labor's Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1995, which lapsed on the dissolution of the last parliament. The present law contains no specific rules relating to debt forgiveness, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thereby creditors are entitled to a tax deduction or capital loss for the amount of debt forgiven and debtors have no tax consequences. These amendments will not treat the debt&hyphen;forgiven debt as a taxable gain, but will apply the forgiven amount in the reduction of certain amounts otherwise taken into account in calculating the debtor's taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another measure in this bill which has come from the Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1995 is schedule 4, which deals with the use of tax file numbers&mdash;another acronym: TFNs&mdash;by superannuation funds. These provisions are aimed at streamlining and reducing the costs of the administration of superannuation generally and funds in particular. Super funds will have the authority to ask all their members who have not provided their tax file number to do so. However, there is no obligation under these proposals on the members to provide TFNs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the super funds want their members to provide TFNs is that there are many super accounts over which the funds cannot locate the beneficiary. That is part of the legacy of Labor's slothful approach to superannuation funds. Even the multiplicity of amendments never quite came to terms with that and many other problems with its compulsory superannuation scheme or schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 5 deals with a pre-election promise made by the coalition to ensure that fringe benefits with a value less than $100 can qualify for the exemption from fringe benefits tax for minor benefits. In the detail stage, I shall be moving an amendment in that connection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current situation is that the Taxation Office has issued an advice that a benefit of less than $50 only qualifies for this exemption. The coalition promised the measure now proposed in its small business policy at the last election, and, as far as it goes, it is entirely supportable. The reason the coalition targeted the FBT for reform is that the cost of compliance is out of control by any measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made the point, Mr Deputy Speaker, in this place on many occasions&mdash;I suspect that you have had to suffer me doing that; and you do not have to nod agreeably!&mdash;that the fringe benefits tax needs radical reform so <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3442"> that it is simplified and so that the cost of complying with the law is reduced, not abstractly but simply to reasonable levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, no doubt, should include a complete review of the FBT so that it is restricted to doing what it was first intended to achieve and what, by any reasonable analysis, a taxpayer, an employer and an employee would expect of it&mdash;that is, to reduce the provision of non-cash remuneration to employees so as to limit the incidence of tax avoidance. No-one has argued with that, but, of course, it has gone much further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doubling the FBT minor benefits exemption goes some way, if only as a signal that it is crazy at the level that it is now at, to achieving this. However, it does not go nearly far enough. Even my proposed amendment does not go nearly far enough, in my opinion, but it is far more sensible than that which the government now envisages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So many of the coalition's promises to small business which are now being implemented have been half&hyphen;measures with more regard for protecting the government's revenue base than providing small businesses with a much better environment which they so earnestly deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the June 1995 Senate Economic References Committee report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A question of balance: the tax treatment of small business</EMPHASIS>, the committee recorded, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . FBT policy and the benefits to revenue from collecting the FBT from the smaller end of the scale should be weighed against the costs incurred by small businesses in preparing and lodging returns relating to small business liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Figures supplied by the ATO and the Treasury reveal that in the year ended 31 March 1994, a total of 71,506 private companies and `other business taxpayers' remitted $696 million in FBT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just over 20,000 of these taxpayers remitted less than $1,000 each, totalling $10 million, representing 1.42 per cent of revenue collected from this group of taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the extraordinary complexity of the FBT, and the very high relative compliance costs associated with their collection from small business, the committee considers that a threshold exemption should apply to the collection of small amounts. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the least, this threshold should reflect the cost of employing a large accounting firm to prepare an FBT return.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee then proceeded to recommend:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that small businesses be exempt from annual FBT liabilities of $200 or less.</PARA>
<PARA>And what could be more reasonable?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. He agrees with me, but he is bound by his government's approach. That does not deny his genuineness in his response to what I propose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for this reason that I will be moving an amendment in the consideration in detail stage to increase this amount to a miserable $200. If it was good enough for the committee to say it and if it is good enough for almost everyone in this chamber to be nodding in agreement at the moment, then it is good enough for that amendment to receive not only careful consideration but also the blessing of the government. Even the member for Braddon could not argue with that, and he is a very austere and frugal man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's election promise on the provisional tax uplift factor, to reduce the rate from eight per cent to six per cent, was arbitrary. I do not think they deny that. It had no justification in logic. It paid no attention to projected growth, income growth and the consumer price index. The setting of the minor benefits threshold that I am suggesting is just another example of an arbitrary figure with no means of justification&mdash;it is just something plucked out of the air&mdash;so my figure is no better or no worse in that sense than that of the government except that mine is more generous and, I submit, far more sensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Economics References Committee has made a logical case for this figure being raised to $200. It is this amount which should be used as the threshold. It is a small <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3443"> step for mankind, as I think someone said in another context, but it is far more of a gesture than the $100 proposed in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noticed with great interest the use of compliance cost impact statements in the explanatory memorandums. This was something trumpeted by the previous government. They and the present government&mdash;so far; admittedly it has had only a short time&mdash;have a long way to go in that regard. These statements were introduced by Labor and are supposed to give a good indication of the cost of complying with a new tax measure. If you look at the statements for the measures contained in this bill, you will see that they fall a long way short of providing a useful guide to the changed cost of compliance. No dollar amounts are mentioned. Why would you have in the explanatory memorandum a cost of compliance proposal and no dollar amounts mentioned? I know why&mdash;because you do not know the answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is difficult to quantify the cost for compliance for individual businesses because of the different sizes of firms, the nature of their businesses and every other variable you could think of; however, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is able to estimate the cost or gain to the revenue, so they should be able to estimate the compliance cost to the economy. If they cannot, they should learn how to very quickly. From this figure they can work out the compliance costs of the average firm. It is one thing to explain how each new provision will impact on compliance costs, but it is largely a waste of time under present circumstances. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to draw to the House's attention the very tragic situation that has occurred in Cyprus in the last two weeks. We had a disgraceful situation occur, caused by the Turkish forces on that island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members of this House will be aware, Cyprus was invaded by Turkey in 1974. There were tens of thousands of refugees dispersed from the northern part of the country by the invading Turkish troops. A number of people disappeared and have not been seen since. The island was divided between the occupied Turkish north of the country and the Republic of Cyprus in the south of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia&mdash;previous Liberal governments, the previous Labor government and the current Liberal government&mdash;has recognised the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus and the government of the Republic of Cyprus is recognised by Australia as having sovereignty over the whole island. What people have tried to do over the years is draw the attention of the international community to this very tragic circumstance. That has been done in a number of ways, both in this parliament, by people in international forums, and particularly by the Greek Cypriot community, both here in Australia and around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the ways looked at in August this year to raise people's consciousness of the Cyprus issue was to have a motorcycle cavalcade from Berlin through Europe, arriving in the occupied city of Kyrenia in Cyprus. That was to be a peaceful drive. There were to be some hundreds of people involved and it was to highlight the Cyprus problem throughout Europe. Unfortunately, the Turkish invaders planned a massive counterdemonstration. They brought in reinforcements from Turkey and there were a number of extremists who have been involved in a terrorist organisation called the Grey Wolves, who were imported by the Turkish invaders, to counter this peaceful demonstration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of the Turkish organisation was to create havoc and give the impression that Turkish and Greek Cypriots could not live together on the island. The problem with that would have been that it would have created this international view that you have violence in Cyprus, you have Turkish Cypriots pitted against Greek Cypriots and the Turkish invaders and the Turkish government would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3444"> have been able to say, `That is the reason we should be there.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, what one would have hoped might not have occurred did occur. The Greek Cypriots were at a peaceful demonstration in the zone between the Turkish occupied part of the country and the republic occupied part of the country. In that area on 11 August there was a peaceful demonstration by Greek Cypriots and the response by the Turks was that 40 people were injured and one young man Anastasios Isaak, a 24-year-old Greek Cypriot, was killed. He was beaten and clubbed to death by people in front of the world media. These are the people who say that Turkey should be admitted to the European Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make matters worse, a few days later on 14 August in a funeral procession for this young man there was once again an incident where another young man, 26-year-old Solomos Solomov, was shot by Turkish troops. A number of peacekeepers were shot by Turkish troops, and a number of other people who were at a demonstration were shot by Turkish troops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an outrageous arrangement and the unfortunate thing is that when the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) condemned this issue he tried to say that this was an intercommunal problem, and it is not. The problem with Cyprus is that the Greek Cypriots are responding to an invader. The Turkish invasion of Cyprus is an international issue; it is not an intercommunal issue in Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Turkish Cypriots have voted with their feet. If the Turkish army was there to protect them, why then have 24 per cent of the Turkish Cypriot community in Cyprus left the island? They don't even feel safe with the Turks who said that they came there to protect them. Indeed, there have been a number of Turkish Australians who have expressed that fear this week. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

In bringing this issue to the parliament, I make no apology for the fact that I am half Greek, on my mother's side, and make it clear that I am speaking out not only on behalf of the Greek Cypriots but also on behalf of the Turkish Cypriots who have lived in harmony in the past as one great nation&mdash;the nation of Cyprus.</PARA></TALK.START>

Patience with the Turkish government is nearing an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I attended a recent protest rally in Sydney commemorating the 22nd anniversary of the invasion of Cyprus. I attended in my own right and was honoured to represent the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. John Howard MP, who asked me to read a message from him to the Australian&hyphen;Cypriot community, which I repeat in this parliament for the record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this anniversary of the invasion of Cyprus in 1974, I offer my best wishes to the Cypriot community in Australia and to the Coordinating Committee of NSW Justice for Cyprus and join with them in commemorating this sad occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After more than two decades of division and suffering, my government wants to see a reunited Cyprus, in which the rights of both Greek and Turkish Cypriots are fully respected and the Cypriot people live in harmony as one nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government supports the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus, including the withdrawal of Turkish forces. We also support the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General, the United States and the Commonwealth to achieve a just and lasting settlement on Cyprus. As a step towards restoring trust, Cyprus should be demilitarised as President Clerides has proposed. Australia has supported the Cypriot people through the contribution of Australian Federal Police to the United Nations peacekeeping operations on Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that Australia's Cypriot community, Greek and Turkish, join with me in hoping for an early end to the division of Cyprus and a spirit of reconciliation which will reunite the Cypriot people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(John Howard) <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3445"> </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, only days after this commemorative service two young unarmed Greek Cypriots lost their lives while protesting against the Turkish government's occupation of one-third of the island of Cyprus. These acts of wanton brutality stand in conflict with the image that the Turkish government is seeking to portray to the world as a civilised, compassionate and democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I extend condolences to the families and friends of the two young men who were murdered. I refer to Tassos Isaak, a 24-year-old man whose wife is pregnant with their first child and was savagely beaten to death, and Solomos Solomov, who was shot dead in cold blood by the Turkish military. The United Nations, in a statement dated 14 August 1996, strongly condemned the killings and, in the words of the UN Secretary&hyphen;General, `the indiscriminate use of force which has caused two men to be killed and many more to be injured, including UN peacekeepers'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to this, the UN representative in Cyprus Mr Gustav Feissel described the killings as `totally unwarranted and inexcusable'. He stressed that, although the Greek Cypriots had broken into the buffer zone, the UN was in control of the situation and was in the process of getting them out when&mdash;and I quote again from Mr Feissel&mdash;`out of the blue the Turkish soldiers started firing'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The frustration which must have been felt by these two young men is indicative of the frustrations felt by all who have watched the island of Cyprus invaded by the Turkish government and it demonstrates the horrific costs that the continued division of Cyprus is inflicting on both the Greeks and the Turkish communities of Cyprus. The Turkish government should not be allowed to continue these unwarranted acts of aggression without the free world condemning their actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members are well aware that this month marks the 22nd anniversary of the Turkish government's occupation of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, TRNC. I am heartened by the fact that the Australian government repudiates that assertion and recognises the Republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island. In <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other words, Australia does not recognise the so-called TRNC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United Nations Security Council has reiterated UN resolution 1062 of 1996, that the status quo is unacceptable, and in fact the UN Security Council has also expressed concerns about the build&hyphen;up of military hardware and foreign forces on the island, including the 35,000 Turkish government military personnel. One of the most important steps we can take in this parliament is to put this issue on the agenda and keep it there, because unless we and other freedom loving nations of the world do so the problem will escalate and that would be in no-one's interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major initiative that must be taken is the insistence that the fates of the missing 1,619 Greek Cypriots and 803 Turkish Cypriots be determined without further delay.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard positive responses to the budget from a wide cross&hyphen;section of people and different interest groups. But tonight I am going to present to the House the responses of two young women from my electorate of McEwen&mdash;Sarah McColl from Upper Plenty and Melanie Coort from Maindample.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two young women are here in Canberra as a result of winning an essay competition I conducted for senior students in McEwen. The topic of the competition was: `As we approach the year 2000 what policies should the federal government adopt for young Australians?' They were present in the gallery when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) delivered the budget speech last night and I am very pleased to say that they are here in the gallery tonight. I have great pleasure in presenting their responses, as young people, to the budget. In their own words, they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The youth of Australia are the future of Australian society, and we believe that it is vital that the Federal Government recognises this and makes a conscious effort to listen to the ideas and concerns of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of last night's Budget, if not all, directly effects young people in Australia. The Budget shows new initiatives and new ideas for our nation. Even though these will not be agreed to by certain interest groups at least they show courage to try new things and move this country into the twenty first century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The traineeship initiative is exactly what many young people need to get them into the workforce. In last nights Budget the Government announced that it is going to provide almost $207 million to employers who take on apprentices. Not only does this aid young people who will obtain apprenticeships, but it will also boost the business community and the economy in turn.</PARA>
<PARA>They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the responsibility of the Government of Australia to convince our country's youth that they have the potential to achieve, and the power to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3447"> influence the direction in which this nation is travelling. The rhetoric that, `the children are our future,' may be overused, however, it is very true. Young people need to know that their opinions are important to decisions which the Federal Government makes.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Sarah, in particular, wanted this House to know this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important and exciting aspect of my trip to Canberra has not been the trip itself, nor is it having dinner in the dining hall with the people who are in charge of running my nation. It is the fact that I have been able to express my views on Australian Society and tell you, my government, what direction I believe this country should proceed in.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the Australian Government has to continue to ask young Australians their opinions on key issues so that they know their voice is being heard. Many young people feel alienated from the political process, partly due to a lack of knowledge of the functions of their Government, but mainly because they do not realise that politicians are there to represent them. The Australian Government must recognise that although they have been given their mandate to govern by the voting population of Australia, they also have a responsibility to represent the great number of Australians who are not yet of voting age, and I believe that Mr. Costello's budget succeeded in terms of this challenge and I was pleased to hear his concerns for the young people in Question Time today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is hope in the foreseeable future most young people won't feel the need to turn to drugs or rebel against their society. Most, if not all young Australians, would be grateful for employment, no matter what the sceptics may say, and I believe that initiatives like the Green Corps are a start on the road to re&hyphen;motivating the young people in this country. Australia's youth will act in a more responsible fashion only when they see clear acknowledgment of their perspective's through Federal Government Policy, and the opportunity that I have been given has allowed me to see this and to gain a better understanding of my government and country.</PARA>
<PARA>Melanie said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This trip has been an inspiration to my life. I have certainly never achieved anything of this standard before. As a Mature Age Student in a small rural town, I find that students do not get enough incentives to stay at school. As announced in the Budget, the Government is offering four thousand new Higher Education scholarships.</PARA>
<PARA>Melanie sees this as an opportunity for the future. In conclusion, might I say that I am <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proud to stand here tonight and speak the words of these two young women.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.46 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight because, like the previous speaker, the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), I too have received a couple of letters in the last couple of days. One was a very urgent letter faxed from the Fairfield City Council which, I will place on record now, is not a Labor controlled council. It came directly from the office of the mayor, who had expressed serious concern on behalf of the Fairfield City Council on a number of issues which were going to be undertaken in cuts in the budget. Of course, after the disastrous budget last night, we now know what they had read about and heard about and how it was going to affect their particular community, which is my city. This is the first opportunity I have had to express their concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mayor has gone on about how upset they are and how the Fairfield city will be adversely affected by the cuts. They talked about the labour market programs&mdash;bearing in mind that the unemployment level of Fairfield city is approximately twice the national average, which is currently at 19 per cent. The letter then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Council has been notified by the National Family Day Care Centre and Community Child Care that changes will be made to operational funding of Children Services.</PARA>
<PARA>We now know that is a fact. The council is very concerned that any cuts that take place would affect English as a second language services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The home and community care program, which has helped so many aged in our community, is almost going to user pays. They then mention the youth activities service, which is a fully funded program providing recreational and educational programs for disadvantaged young people aged between 11 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3448"> and 16. These activities are held on a regular basis throughout Fairfield city. They say they are concerned because there have been rumours that this program will be axed. We now know that is a fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have certainly voiced my concern and I will do it again, because the council raised the urban flood mitigation program and what the cessation of money coming from the federal government is going to mean to an area like Fairfield city. They have been involved in this program from the very onset in a 2 to 1 relationship as far as the funding program goes. Clearly, with the federal government pulling out of this, it will now mean that all mitigation works that had been undertaken&mdash;or were planed to be undertaken in the future&mdash;instead of now taking 15 years to complete, may go on the never-never plan. It is estimated that something like $33 million worth of work is yet to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are concerned about the Commonwealth-state housing agreement; the better cities program; the regional development; and the foreshadowed, as it was then, reduction in the resources of the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. We now know, after the budget, that we haven't got to worry about the reduction in it, because we just will not have a Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are very concerned about the cuts to the University of Western Sydney. Fairfield City Council&mdash;which, I reiterate, is a Liberal controlled council; there is an independent mayor there at the moment&mdash;has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fairfield City Council seeks a commitment from the government that:&hyphen;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the planned cuts will be put on hold until there has been an independent assessment of their impact on regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> there will be ongoing consultation with Local Government about proposed changes in government policy which will affect local communities . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> there will be an undertaking that the Federal Government does indeed have a role in regional Australia and this will be reinforced through provision of adequately funded services.</PARA>
<PARA>I have put that on record because I found it quite extraordinary that I had received that type of letter from my city council.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that was followed up by a copy of another letter that has just been sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) from the Fairfield Community Resource Centre. It is marvellous when you realise that these community groups are now all coming out expressing their disquiet and concern because of what has come out in the budget. They are certainly expressing their concern, as a community resource centre that works particularly with non-English speaking people, about the employment orientated programs conducted through our community in Fairfield, about what it has been able to do for the community through skillshare, the AMES and the new enterprise incentive schemes, and about how now these schemes are going to be affected because of what the budget has spelt out very clearly to the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That community resource centre has also asked me to raise the cuts to the migration program and how they are being reported from all levels within the community: the reduction of the humanitarian program, the introduction of the extra points for the English language proficiency, and the restriction of sponsorship ability under the preferential family for Australian citizens only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They said that another area of grave concern to them as a community relates to the proposed industrial relations bill being considered by the parliament. Of course, we know where that is and we know what is happening there in the Senate. It will give me great satisfaction to write back to them and say that possibly the government of the day may have bought off a particular senator up there and may have, as part of a deal, tried to get an extra vote in that way. We do not know, but we just hope commonsense does prevail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that a community group like this that has worked at close hand with the local people wrote to the Prime Minister and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are outraged by the current attack on migrant and refugee communities who are being used as scapegoats for the country's present deficit. The Government's push for the introduction of a 2-year exclusion period of newly arrived migrants to access most Social Security benefits negates the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3449"> considerable financial and human contribution that migrants have made&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and will continue to make, in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amended legislation will clearly make migrants second-class citizens with no equal basis rights as the rest of the Australian population.</PARA>
<PARA>I fully endorse that comment from the Fairfield Community Resource Centre.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.51 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to impress upon the House this evening the importance of establishing the Natural Heritage Trust Fund. The current budget, which was so ably introduced last night by my colleague the Treasurer, Peter Costello, is a fair and reasonable budget. It gave an undertaking that $158 million would be spent over four years for the environment related initiatives, on top of the planned Natural Heritage Trust. I can assure honourable members that that money was extremely well received in my electorate. The allocation for this year's budget was $30 million. I received a very welcome announcement in my electorate, which is part of the Murray-Darling catchment basin. The money, which was quite substantial, was introduced into a number of areas. The importance of the Natural Heritage Trust, with an input of $1 billion into the revival of our environment in Australia, can never be underestimated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation is over in another place at the moment. It is dependent upon the sale of one-third of the shares in Telstra. It is interesting to note that the claim that we made prior to the election, that the former government had done a deal with the sale of the information technology group out of Telstra to IBM&hyphen;Lend Lease and that that was a fait accompli before the election, was proven to be the case. The very heart of the Telstra organisation&mdash;the information technology group&mdash;was all wrapped up and signed, sealed and delivered before the election. The government kept that under wraps. It is important that the sale and the public subscription to one-third of the shares in Telstra go ahead to enable us to push forward with the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A week is certainly a long time in politics. During the last few hours and earlier this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> week there have been some exciting and interesting developments in another place. The change of logistics and complexion of the Senate have been rather interesting to watch to see what is happening over there, with Senator Colston becoming the Deputy President of the Senate. I congratulate him on his election to that position and his elevation to that office. It certainly has changed the whole complexion of the Senate chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I implore members of both sides of the parliament to support the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust. It is extremely important for rural areas throughout Australia and also for the urban environment. My good friend at the table, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), also has some interest in this matter and would certainly be interested in the green corps, which will be involved not only in rural pursuits in the environment but also in urban pursuits. The honourable member had quite an amount of input into that scheme. I look forward to the implementation of that scheme because I can see some tremendous possibilities under that Natural Heritage Trust for the expenditure of money, which will be a capital investment in the environment of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There could be no better achievement for our young people&mdash;we have some of them in the gallery with us this evening&mdash;than to be able to participate in putting something back into a capital project in an environment based activity. We have already triggered a certain amount of money in this budget, but more money is required. We have all sorts of problems. The salinity impact in my area is of huge importance. We need to arrest the degradation of land and water quality. It is particularly important to the Bendigo electorate, and I am sure for many members in their own electorate, to do something about improving the environment for our young people and for the future of this country.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.56 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I decided to visit Halls Creek when I got news of the riot there. I was accompanied by Mark Nevill, the Western Australian state member for this mining and pastoral region. As inexcusable as the riot was, it pales into <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3450"> insignificance when put alongside the behaviour at Parliament House here on Monday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went to Halls Creek because we were keen to ascertain what really happened, not just what was reported. Events in a town which develop into a riot completely out of control are not new. There have been several incidents in recent years where the police have just been able to contain the situation and avoid the large&hyphen;scale publicity that ensues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The worrying thing is that the recent riots involved young people. Our investigation shows that there was no element of payback, as reported in the media. A review of the charge sheet shows that the participants came overwhelmingly from desert communities. The disturbance did not start in the pub. The police did not trigger the event by arresting anyone in the pub. The publican's staff say that the crowd had been drinking before the pub opened at 4 p.m. It appears that they had had access to fortified wine that may have come from the bottle shop. It is also clear that there was no participation in the riot by local Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Policing is difficult in country areas where there are large numbers of Aboriginal people and particularly where there are people living in outlying communities in considerable numbers. By and large, the police do a good job and provide a visible service that goes far beyond law and order issues. Their dedication is even more remarkable when the widespread demoralised state of the force is considered. A large part of the problem is caused by the actions of a few overzealous senior officers, who have now left, particularly ex&hyphen;Deputy Commissioner Les Ayton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Policing areas such as Halls Creek, Fitzroy Crossing, Leonora, Laverton, Carnarvon and Broome, et cetera is different as well as difficult and requires people with special training and attitude. These people are available and their skills and leadership should be cherished and nourished by the police force. Policing these areas, where there is a high component of Aboriginal people, is overwhelming community policing and it requires police to be able to get to know the people on an individual basis.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The police are already providing services that should be provided by other government departments&mdash;ATSIC, health, education and welfare&mdash;and other agencies. The provision of a police presence in all major communities will improve all facets of service delivery for these agencies. It is quite clear that the police force cannot provide this necessary service out of its own budget. This should be recognised and addressed. Instead we see examples of waste and incompetence in these areas. ATSIC has decided to cut funding by 20 per cent over the next five years in remote areas and direct these savings to cities, largely Sydney and Melbourne. This is an inequitable decision and will compound problems in the bush and literally drive people out of the communities to impact mainly on country towns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Police resources must be increased. This would be a very good use of ATSIC funds. However, they could not and should not be expected to do it all. Other departments must be made to play their part. I am hopeful that the appointment of John Standing to the northern division&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports wholeheartedly the Australia Law Reform Commission Bill and the Australia Law Reform Commission (Repeal, Transitional and Miscellaneous) Bill. It is particularly pleasing for me to support these bills because, in the last parliament, I was the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which inquired into the Law Reform Commission of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) was also a member of that committee. It was obvious throughout the hearings that the Law Reform Commission had cross&hyphen;party support. We undertook the first comprehensive review of the commission in its 20&hyphen;year existence. It is really pleasing to note that our review showed that the Law Reform Commission was a dynamic organisation that was producing quality reports and was giving quality independent advice to government. It is essential in a democracy like ours that we have something like the Law Reform Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government had picked up, as I understand it, most of the recommendations of my parliamentary committee. This current government has also done that. I think that is testimony to the cross&hyphen;party support that the Law Reform Commission rightfully enjoys. The one sad aspect is that budget cuts will affect the operation of the Law Reform Commission because, in the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS>, the coalition admitted that cuts would affect the commission. They will result in a small reduction in the number of reports produced by the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission's budget of $3.9 million per year will be cut by $0.5 million per year, or 12.8 per cent. That was announced during the election campaign and was administered in the budget yesterday. That is a small hiccup and I am sure that a dynamic organisation such as the Law Reform Commission will be able to make the necessary adjustments. What worries me in the current climate is that it is going to be very hard for some people to say, `No, this is not the way to go.' That is why we need an independent Law Reform Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the Attorney&hyphen;General, in his usual courteous fashion, is here today, paying us the courtesy of listening to this debate. I appreciate that. I have said it a number of times&mdash;and I cannot say it enough&mdash;that, while I do not agree with everything that the Attorney&hyphen;General is doing because obviously we do differ on a number of things&mdash;and I respect and understand that&mdash;I must say that he brings distinction to his position.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3455">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position of Attorney&hyphen;General is one that, in a cabinet, needs to be a challenging position and one that is understood to be so. The Attorney&hyphen;General cannot be a yes&hyphen;man or a yes&hyphen;woman. He or she is the first law officer of the Crown, who needs to take on the cabinet at times&mdash;and the cabinet needs to understand that. The Attorney&hyphen;General is there to provide proper advice in relation to the existing law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General has really the same role and function as the Australian Law Reform Commission, which is there to keep us all honest and not to pander to prejudice in the community or to the lowest common denominator, nor to advise politically or in a partisan fashion. It is there to assist us as law&hyphen;makers and to provide the Attorney&hyphen;General with independent and proper advice. It is not there to have all its recommendations picked up, but it is part of the equation. It is part of the jigsaw, as is the Attorney&hyphen;General's office. The Attorney&hyphen;General made an outstanding contribution in the last parliament to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is interesting that, on each occasion that he has had the opportunity in government, he has attempted to build on the recommendations and the views that he expressed when he was on the backbench.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The downside is that we should not get carried away with all this backslapping and bipartisanship, because we need to continually be on our mettle. I am fearful that, in the current climate of the push for law and order, tougher sentencing and a whole range of so&hyphen;called reforms in the legal and justice area, we are being driven by the lowest common denominator, the redneck radio commentators, the ill&hyphen;informed and the prejudiced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 10 years as a practising solicitor and barrister in New South Wales, I never had a case accurately or properly reported by the press. It was always sensationally reported. The Law Reform Commission and advisory bodies like that bring us, as politicians, back to heel a little. What we need are considered, informed debates and an independent, vibrant, Law Reform Commission to give us non&hyphen;partisan, non&hyphen;political advice. What we are about is good law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the American way of doing things, I do not think that is the path to go down. That is why I wholeheartedly support what the Attorney&hyphen;General has done, and so does the opposition as a whole. We are pleased to give our support to this bill. It is a bill about which we can say, `We laid the foundations for it, and the ball has been passed to this government and, in effect, they are running over and scoring the try.' That is the case. It has been basically a partnership in the implementation of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not that way when we started our inquiry into the Law Reform Commission. It is fair to say that there was a view around that we could probably do without the Law Reform Commission and that it, in some areas, had not been up to scratch. There is no doubt that the dynamism of the people who have headed the Law Reform Commission has impacted on the sorts of reports that the commission has done, and that it has evolved. There is no doubt that occasionally its emphasis has not necessarily been endorsed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting throughout our inquiry that there were a number of professionals within the legal profession and a number of people within the business community who were prepared to donate their time to assist in the compilation of reports and to provide professionalism to the reports that the Law Reform Commission was providing for this parliament and the nation. They were able to do that because of their sense of professionalism, and the high regard in which the Law Reform Commission is held. A parliamentary committee cannot do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there was a view around that maybe we could do away with the Law Reform Commission and set up a parliamentary committee that has those particular functions. I do <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3456"> not agree with that. The less the politicians are involved in areas like this, the better, because what we do, in a number of instances, is that whilst we are well&hyphen;meaning we do not have that experience, that professionalism, on the ground. We have changed; we may well have thought we were good lawyers before we entered parliament, but the truth is that you do lose that contact on the ground. That is something that the Law Reform Commission can do&mdash;as an independent, statutory body it can reach into a whole range of professional communities and produce quality reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The title of our report to the parliament was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Law reform: the challenge continues</EMPHASIS> and I think the Law Reform Commission is taking up the challenge, especially in the current climate. This is particularly so because, as a centralist&mdash;and I do not apologise for that&mdash;I think it is absurd in a nation such as ours, as we are heading to the centenary of Federation, that we have six state jurisdictions and two territory jurisdictions so that, but for an accident of birth or depending on where you are in Australia, you are subject to different penalties and different rules apply. That is why with the Law Reform Commission, arising out of the reports and arising out of this bill, there is some flexibility. What we are looking for is a national approach to coordinate the states so that there is no division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are a Queenslander, why should you be dealt with differently by the law than if you were born in New South Wales and dealt with in New South Wales? This is where the Law Reform Commission assists us because it is able to overarch, to reach into those state instrumentalities, to find agreement&mdash;and it is not easy&mdash;and bring down a proper perspective. So I commend the bill to the parliament. It has the wholehearted support of the opposition. Indeed, it is fair to say that our fingerprints are all over it&mdash;and proudly so. But so are the Attorney&hyphen;General's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to acknowledge that, in terms of the reference that the last parliament dealt with, it was the current Attorney&hyphen;General who was the driving force behind the reference and was enthusiastic about our doing the reference. I know he is a supporter of the Law Reform Commission&mdash;as he should be because, on any proper analysis of what it has done over the last 20 years, it really does get the big tick. And what it again shows is that, in the Law Reform Commission, a lot of the people involved are committed to public service in the true professional sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also shows that there are those in the private professions who are prepared to work with the Law Reform Commission and who, instead of charging the thousands and thousands of dollars they quite rightly can command in their own professions, donate many of their services for free, from a sense of public duty. We found that it was just token travel expenses that were being met. That is the benefit of the Law Reform Commission. It is part of the equation. It is part of that partnership that the parliament has with the community. So I commend the Attorney for picking up most of the recommendations in our report and carrying them through in the current climate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say it is somewhat humbling to follow the member for Banks (Mr Melham) who was chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when the report which is the basis of this legislation was handed down. I also note that the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), who is in the chamber today and was a member of the committee at the same time, indicated in his second reading speech that he was pleased to be able to implement, in his role as Attorney&hyphen;General, substantially the bulk <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3457"> of the recommendations of the committee which were contained in the report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Law reform: the challenge continues</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Attorney&hyphen;General, Michael Lavarch, indicated that the overriding principles, as he saw the government's role in terms of the legal system, were threefold. Firstly, all Australians should have equality before the law. Secondly, Australians, regardless of their place of residence, should have similar rights and privileges. Thirdly, Australians should have equal access to legal services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, if obtaining justice is prohibitive for ordinary Australians, the legal system becomes all but irrelevant to them. If our legal system does not remain both relevant and accessible, it will have repercussions for our legal system itself and, of course, for the principle of the rule of law, which we all cherish so dearly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in that context that the role of the Law Reform Commission can be particularly worthwhile. It is my experience that the cost of access to the law is not only a result of the costs of the participants, the lawyers, the transcript fees and the filing fees, but also results in large part from legal complexities which can necessitate litigants requiring the services of those specialist lawyers. So any steps that can be taken to make the law more relevant and accessible and to simplify it will ultimately be of benefit to our legal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the thrust of these bills is not only to give the Australian Law Reform Commission a new title and to update and modernise the drafting of the former provisions, but also to affect three other significant areas. The legislation will require the Law Reform Commission, as it will be reconstituted, to consider proposals for complementary laws between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories; to have regard to such of Australia's international treaty obligations as are relevant; and to take into account the implications of its recommendations on lowering the cost of justice. It is those three issues which I would like to address today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to speak firstly in terms of complementary laws, perhaps not only because it is topical but also because it is very relevant as part of the make&hyphen;up of our society today, about the efficient functioning of our industrial relations system. If I can give one example of the complexities that exist, it is in respect of the provision which is proposed in the Workplace Relations Bill for the disamalgamation of trade unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We exist, under the federal system, in a position where trade unions are usually registered under that federal system and also under state systems. Quite frequently, the trade unions which are registered under the state systems are, in effect, the same as the branches of the federal body. It is usually the case that the membership is duplicated. Yet, under those separate state systems, it is frequently the case that the legislation purports to give a separate corporate identity to that state union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is faced with a position and, indeed, the trade unions are faced with a position of trying to identify, literally, who is who in the zoo. With respect to the disamalgamation of trade unions, it will not only be a question of unscrambling the egg in terms of the division of assets and the division of members but also there will be the question of identifying which chicken the egg came from and then allocating the chicken to the appropriate jurisdiction, whether it be state or federal and whether that can be done at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the amalgamation was the result of, say, a federation of those state registered trade unions, it may be that the federal legislation cannot have any impact on them at all. I do not wish to discuss the federal industrial relations legislation. I am merely pointing out that great <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3458"> complications arise every day as a result of our federal system and hence the need to reform. It creates complexities in trade unions and it creates complexities for any enforcement agency trying to work out who is responsible for a particular conduct, or against which body some particular award or penalty could be enforced. Similarly, the same thing would apply to employer organisations which wanted to seek some redress. The inconvenience and dislocation apply across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not suggesting that the government has created that dislocation or uncertainty. The problems were first demonstrated in 1972 and it resulted in the Sweeney inquiry, as it was then known. But, regrettably, the federal and state legislatures have seen fit to do very little about it in that 24&hyphen;year period. Hopefully, with this new and specific direction, the Law Reform Commission can roll up its sleeves and look at issues that permeate our everyday lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area that the Law Reform Commission has an obligation to consider is Australia's international treaty obligations, as they are relevant to Australia. This is an increasingly important area. The significance of treaties has been underlined by the fact that the federal parliament has, as I recall, with bipartisan support, established the treaties committee&mdash;it is now the second largest joint standing committee&mdash;to look at international treaties before they are made and to review treaties that are already in force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In more recent times, the High Court has referred to Australia's international treaty obligations in considering the development of the common law which, fortunately, continues to live, grow, adapt and mould itself according to society as we know it. We have now come to a situation where the High Court recognises that Australia is part of an international community and that what happens in that international community will affect the very fabric of our own society and the infrastructure of laws itself. That is, in my opinion, a highly desirable eventuality and trend. It is one which I believe will continue, largely irrespective of which government is in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a middle order power on the world stage, and we have two choices: we can participate in an international community where there is a developing and growing international rule of law, or we can return to the days of the 1950s, 1960s and into the 1970s, where we were substantially beholden to the respective calls made by the superpowers. It is in our interests, I would submit, that the influence of the five or six superpowers, as they are known, be tempered by a mutuality, established between all nations and existing and developing the international rule of law to which I have referred; and Australia can play a part in the development of such mutuality through negotiating, developing and reviewing treaties. This is an appropriate role, as I have indicated, in which the Law Reform Commission could look at not only what has happened domestically but also what has occurred through our attaching and linking ourselves to the international community and, indeed, to the international standards as set by international treaty documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third and final area which is highly significant is the obligation cast upon the Australian Law Reform Commission to have regard to the costs of justice. As I have earlier noted, the cost of justice is itself significant, in terms of the access that the ordinary Australian can have to the legal system&mdash;and not only the ordinary Australian but also the business community. I must say that, in my former employment as a solicitor, I was involved in one or two pieces of litigation on a personal basis; and, even though I had the resources of a legal firm supporting me, I spent a few hours awake during the night worrying about the possible consequences of the legal costs and, indeed, the all but disaster which would befall if the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3459"> litigation were lost. I can well imagine how much more accentuated those costs would be for an ordinary Australian who did not have such resources. When we have come to that situation in life, we clearly have to take stock and have a look at the lie of the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In that context, I note some concern that there is a trend to recoup, if you like, the cost of justice by the court registries themselves. That is something which applies in the states, and I note that there is presently a draft bill&mdash;which I will not discuss, because it is quite inappropriate here&mdash;to raise the filing fees of federal tribunals. I would ask all those involved, however, to recognise that there are not only up&hyphen;front costs of litigation, in the sense of paying for lawyers, which is but one aspect of the legal costs, but also the costs of filing fees&mdash;which, in some instances in the Federal Court, may well increase to $1,600&mdash;to be added to the cost of transcripts, for instance, which currently would cost a litigant approximately $750 per day, in addition to what they are paying for the barristers and for the solicitors. Even where there is supposedly a cost free jurisdiction currently, such as under the Industrial Relations Act 1988, those hidden costs still apply. Each litigant still has to meet the costs of that $750 per day transcript.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these hidden costs have to be factored into any equation when we are considering access to justice. Again it is entirely appropriate that the Law Reform Commission looks at those matters and other matters it may have regard to in terms of the cost of litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another significant area on which I would hope the Law Reform Commission would focus in its independent role is access to legal resource materials. In this parliament we are very fortunate indeed in the access we have through our computer network system to a wide range of resources through the Parliamentary Library, including access to High Court cases, state cases, legislation and the like. It has to be a fact that, if that resource base becomes more accessible throughout the community, the reduced cost of finding the law or researching the law will bring down the costs of law. So I hope that is one area to which the Law Reform Commission will consider it appropriate to give further consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one negative aspect. While I give due recognition to the support of the Attorney&hyphen;General for the Law Reform Commission which was commented on by the member for Banks in his speech before mine, I am concerned that, in the context of the complexities and the developments to which I have referred, the government has seen fit to reduce the funding available to the Law Reform Commission. That is something which I regret and, indeed, the Labor opposition regrets. We hope that, as this newly constituted&mdash;if you like&mdash;Law Reform Commission undertakes its task, the government may well reconsider the question of funding that body. I think it will be found that with its new charter the Law Reform Commission will become even more effective and deserving of support. I support the bills before the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your guidance. This particular bill largely implements the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and is yet another indication of the success of the House of Representatives committee system. The future of the Law Reform Commission was referred to this committee after the Law Reform Commission had been in existence for some 20 years. This is largely a housekeeping bill. After the Law Reform Commission has played a role for 20 years it is sensible to review the legislation; it is appropriate to review the functions of the Law Reform Commission. In effect, it is important to take a stocktake to ensure that the Australian taxpayer is receiving value for dollar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had, I think, some 61 submissions, and we made 40 recommendations. The new Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), having succeeded his Labor predecessor, has considered the recommendations of the committee and has brought forward this bill. The Attorney&hyphen;General, I believe, is very well qualified to consider matters in the area of law reform, having been the chairman of the Law Reform Commission of Western Australia when he was in private practice in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does a number of things. It formally changes the name of the commission to the Australian Law Reform Commission. It requires the commission to consider proposals for complementary laws between the Commonwealth and the states and territories, to have regard for such of Australia's international treaty obligations as are relevant, and to take into account the implications of its recommendations on lowering the cost of justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also enables the commission to appoint consultants, it clarifies the role of the deputy president and provides for the appointment of an acting president in the president's absence or when the office of president is vacant. It also provides for the establishment of a board of management comprising the president, deputy president and full&hyphen;time members. It confers chief executive officer powers on the president or the president's delegate and confers appropriate powers on the full commission or a delegate of the full commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, the bill also provides members and staff with immunity from civil action, the cause of which necessarily or reasonably arises in the course of duties being honestly undertaken before the commission. In these days of financial stringency, no doubt it is a very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3461"> great relief to see that there will be no additional financial obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found the evidence before the committee to be very thought provoking. The committee was able to attract a large number of submissions from a very broad range of people involved in the law reform community throughout Australia. One of the things the committee did was to review the situation in individual states and it was quite interesting to see that the law reform process is approached quite differently in different parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agreed substantially with the results of the deliberations of the committee; however, in the report I registered an expression of concern in relation to a number of areas. I did not elevate the expression of concern, to the chairman's relief, to that of a dissenting report, but I was concerned particularly about three issues. I was convinced by the arguments of the Premier of Western Australia that the Law Reform Commission ought to, in fact, be referred to as the Commonwealth Law Reform Commission because that would indicate a clear demarcation of the work undertaken by the commission. I took the view, and mentioned in the report, that the designation `Commonwealth Law Reform Commission' would be a more appropriate manner in which to describe the Commonwealth body responsible for federal law reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people would say that the Australian Law Reform Commission has a facilitating role in relation to law reform beyond the area of Commonwealth responsibility and that it has liaised quite successfully with state bodies and, I believe, bodies across the Tasman with a view to attaining, to the greatest degree possible, uniformity of law. It is obvious that the new government has accepted the recommendation of the committee that the name be changed from the Law Reform Commission of Australia to the Australian Law Reform Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had, however, a more major concern in relation to the preparation of draft legislation accompanying the reports of the Law Reform Commission. The former chairman, who is sitting opposite, would well remember my views on this matter. I recall that, on many occasions, the Law Reform Commission would bring down reports which would be sent to the Attorney and government of the day for consideration. The government would take a considerable amount of time to decide what its response was going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rarely would the government agree to implement the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in full. The draft legislation, which was prepared by the Law Reform Commission, would often languish and be unused. Even if the government accepted partially the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission, by the time it came forward with a response the draft legislation, prepared at great cost to the Australian taxpayer, was entirely out of date. In fact, there was some evidence before the committee that the preparation of draft legislation was a delaying factor in the production of reports of the Law Reform Commission. I remain very concerned about this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for the government to consider reports of the Law Reform Commission as expeditiously as possible. I have no doubt that the current Attorney will not permit the delays which have existed in the past to continue. I just do not really see the point in preparing draft legislation when there is no certainty at all that there will be a change in law. I personally feel that the time to prepare the draft legislation is when the government says what it wants the new law to be. However, I am in a minority on that issue and I presume that the Law Reform Commission will, when it deems it appropriate, continue to prepare draft legislation to accompany reports passed on to the government for consideration.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3462">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of international treaty obligations is a matter that has concerned me for a very long time. I outlined in the report the hypocrisy of the Labor government. One thing that did concern me greatly was the way that this country could sign and ratify a treaty by the Governor&hyphen;General sitting in Executive Council with any two ministers. It could be binding on Australia even though the particular subject matter of that treaty had not been referred even to the cabinet, the ministry, the government party, either house of the parliament or the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the coalition has a more effective treaty making process. It has more appropriate procedures and these will progressively be put in place but, nevertheless, one of the problems that we have as a nation is that we have entered into some 2,000 treaties concerning a broad range of areas. No&hyphen;one would object to some of those treaties but there are others where from time to time the collective values of the Australian community may change. If there is no provision for withdrawal from a treaty, either set out in the terms of the treaty or able to be implied from the terms of the treaty, then my understanding is that the only way that this country can withdraw from such a treaty is to go back and renegotiate with all of the other contracting parties to that treaty. Sometimes more than 100 countries sign a treaty and, therefore, there could be some treaties from which this country could never escape, should the values of the country no longer be represented by that treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International law is becoming increasingly important. Many people in my electorate would say, `Well, what we should do is simply tear a treaty up if we don't agree with the terms of it'. But, of course, that could put Australia out of step with its international obligations and we would not want Australia to be an international outlaw.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I largely support the report of the committee. The government, naturally, supports this bill because it is a government bill. I am pleased that the opposition is joining with us in endorsing this particular piece of legislation. It will give, after some 23 years, an even more efficient Law Reform Commission to serve the people of Australia very well into the next century. I commend the bill to the Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The government is very grateful to the opposition for its support of this bill, and I also would like to thank the member for Banks (Mr Melham), the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) and the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) for their contributions to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mention has been made by all speakers of the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in the previous parliament. I think that committee will stand as a model for the development of legislation in the national interest. I would like to think that there will be in this parliament and in future parliaments committees that will operate on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe its success was attributable to a number of things; its membership among others. The chairman, the member for Banks, was instrumental in its achievements because of his willingness to commit the committee to examination of issues on their merits. Most of the material that came before the committee was dealt with on a bipartisan basis and the selection of references has something to do with its success. But at the same time, under the chairmanship of the member for Banks, the issues were fairly and squarely addressed, and I congratulate him on his record in that respect. Other members of the committee made a significant contribution. The member for Fisher was a conscientious member, as were the former member for Holt and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3463"> among others. I think the work of the House standing committees is important. It has been under&hyphen;utilised and underestimated as a resource, but I think the selection of references is an important part of the success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the reference to that committee on the Australian Law Reform Commission as it is to become, that was a very thorough piece of work, reviewing a body which has functioned for many years and attained significant successes itself. The report is, in basic terms, a set of recommendations on the structure and operation, as well as the functions, of the commission. I think it will set a new direction for the commission in its operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks suggested that the fingerprints of the previous government were all over it. I do not really agree with that. I think the fingerprints of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs are all over the report. While he suggested that the present government was going to score the try, I would see it as being a triumph for that previous committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Barton made some comments on a number of matters referred to in the report and in the bill. In particular, he referred to the proposals for implementing complementary state and territory laws, the proposal that in performing its functions the commission have regard to relevant treaty obligations and finally the obligations of the commission to have regard to the costs of access to justice. In the latter respect he particularly referred to court and tribunal fees proposed in yesterday's budget. I will not say anything about that; I will save comments for the appropriate time and the appropriate forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also mentioned the reduced budget. In that respect, let me say the budget reductions to the ALRC were a component of clearly signalled policy in pursuance of the government's program of savings measures and were set out in its election document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our Commitments</EMPHASIS>. It is true that the savings will to some extent reduce the commission's capacity to undertake several major references at once but I have been assured by the commission that it will be able to progress all its current references as planned and it will be able to undertake a further major new reference commencing in the current financial year. It will still be possible to give the commission additional work. In particular, the commission will be able to take on additional references on issues where funding is provided, in effect, by a client department specifically on a direct reference basis. The savings will to some extent reduce the commission's extracurricular activities but the resultant strategic planning will mean that the commission will be more focused on its primary task of reporting and advising the government on priority areas of law reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Fisher mentioned his expressions of concern, which are in the report of the House Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Commonwealth Law Reform Commission suggestion was not picked up by the other members of the committee. In fact, the recommendation that the committee be called the ALRC is merely a reflection of common parlance. It has for many years been referred to as the Australian Law Reform Commission or the ALRC, despite the statute naming it the Law Reform Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subject of draft legislation was debated at length within the committee. The views of the member for Fisher are well known on the subject. My personal view expressed repeatedly in those debates was that, in many instances, a commission would use the mechanism of drafting legislation as a means of identifying issues for consideration in the course of a reference, whether the draft legislation was sought by the actual reference, and whether that draft legislation was appended to the report.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3464">
<PARA> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Finally, in relation to treaties, I think that the member for Fisher can rest easy because the coalition's policy has been effectively implemented. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Downer) and I on 2 May, the second sitting day of this government, introduced a number of measures and, subsequent to that, we have had the formation of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. COAG, at its meeting in June, established a Treaties Council, involving the state and territory governments. The commission will, under the bill, in performing its functions have regard to all relevant treaty obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing the debate, I submit that the proposed legislation is a demonstration of the government's commitment to having a viable law reform agency which is able to advise it on keeping Australia's laws up to date. The government agrees with the committee chaired by the member for Banks in its recognition of the importance of having a permanent and separate agency to provide detailed policy advice on law reform matters to the Attorney&hyphen;General and the parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, we have a situation where the opposition supports the bill before this committee and the House. I think that it needs to be acknowledged that the reason that this is happening often in the early part of this session&mdash;and I will give the background to this&mdash;is that one needs to acknowledge that the current government has picked up virtually all of the previous government's bills. We need to acknowledge the tremendous work that was put in by the previous Attorney&hyphen;General, the Hon. Michael Lavarch, and the previous Minister for Justice and the current member for Denison (Mr Kerr) in relation to a number of bills that we have debated in this session of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a testimony to the work that they have put in that most of those bills have been picked up by the present government and have been championed in the same form as in when they were introduced into the previous parliament. That shows that in a lot of areas there is cross&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3465"> party support for these proposals. That is not to say that there has not been vigorous debate behind the scenes or differences of opinion on either side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I acknowledge the tremendous commitment to law reform of the previous Attorney&hyphen;General, the Hon. Michael Lavarch, and the current member for Denison. It is true that in the last parliament&mdash;and, again, it needs to be acknowledged&mdash;many of the reforms were reforms championed by another previous Attorney&hyphen;General, my good friend the Hon. Michael Duffy. The contribution that he made when he was Attorney&hyphen;General was not acknowledged enough, unfortunately. That contribution carried on after he left that office because many of the reforms that others picked up and ran with were reforms that he initiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill follows an exhaustive review of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, held in consultation with the private profession, representative civil liberties groups and interested government agencies. The terms of approval by the new government are almost identical, except for minor technical differences, to the terms of approval of the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In August 1994, the former Attorney&hyphen;General, the Hon. Michael Lavarch, approved the circulation of an issues paper to all federal, state and territory prosecution and investigation agencies, law societies, bar associations, the Law Council of Australia and representative civil liberties associations. All but two recommendations in the issues paper were accepted by all respondents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In mid&hyphen;1995, the previous Labor government approved the introduction of legislation to implement the recommendations in the review paper, plus a number of additional technical matters and two additions specifically requested by the previous Attorney&hyphen;General, the Hon. Michael Lavarch. This needs to be acknowledged. There was the specific death penalty refusal ground which is in the act. It is currently clause 41, and I will come to that shortly. That provision, I might add, was also supported by the member for Denison, the previous Minister for Justice, and that has been picked up by this government. So what my good friend the Hon. Michael Duffy used to call `the hangers and the floggers' have not had their way in relation to this act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other provision was to enable a defendant to apply to a foreign country for assistance. That was something that the previous Attorney&hyphen;General championed. It has been picked up in this bill because that legislation was not introduced before the election. But this bill, certainly as introduced, implements the policy agreed by cabinet in May 1995, as I say, including the clause in relation to the death penalty and the one on access to defendants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I want to talk about item 41, subclauses 8(1A) and 8(1B). Basically, it is worthwhile reading on to the record what is in the explanatory memorandum, because I think that sets it all out. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">59. This item inserts 2 new subclauses after subsection 8(1) relating to refusal of assistance in relation to offences carrying the death penalty in the requesting country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">60. Subclause 8(1A) provides that the Attorney&hyphen;General must refuse a request for assistance from a foreign country if it relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with or convicted of an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed; the subsection allows the Attorney&hyphen;General limited discretion to grant the assistance sought if there are special circumstances in the particular case. Such circumstances would arise if the evidence sought could be exculpatory. Normally assistance would not be granted unless the requesting state gave an assurance that the death penalty, if imposed, would not be carried out. However it would not be appropriate for Australia to insist that an assurance be given in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3466"> all cases. For example it would not be appropriate for an assurance to be required where the assistance sought by the request is of an exculpatory nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">61. Item 41 also inserts new subclause 8(1B) which provides that, if the Attorney&hyphen;General believes provision of the assistance may result in the death penalty being imposed on a person, the Attorney&hyphen;General may refuse the assistance, after taking into account the interests of international criminal co&hyphen;operation, if the Attorney&hyphen;General is of the opinion that in the circumstances of the case assistance should be refused.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">62. Subclause 8(1A) will apply where charges carrying the death penalty have been laid in a foreign country (or the person has been convicted of an offence carrying the death penalty); in these circumstances assistance must be refused except in special circumstances. Subclause 8(1B) applies where charges have not yet been laid in the foreign country. In such requests it is intended that there be more discretion available to the Attorney&hyphen;General to grant assistance. In the exercise of the discretion the Attorney&hyphen;General may take into account the interests of international criminal co&hyphen;operation (including the desire to maximise possibilities of reciprocal assistance by the foreign country to Australia and of the general international interest in cross&hyphen;jurisdictional assistance in serious criminal matters) and the surrounding circumstances of the case.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what is in the explanatory memorandum. It adequately encompasses a description of what that section is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly something that I endorse. It is Labor policy and it has been introduced in this bill. The Labor Party supports its inclusion. I, in particular, support its inclusion. I do not describe myself as part of the `hangers and floggers'. I think it is right and appropriate that this bill contains these clauses. I commend this government for putting that clause in. It is one of the reasons that the legislation has cross&hyphen;party support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not one who believes in the death penalty; I say that here and now. There are many instances where it has been shown that, if the death penalty had been carried out, many innocent people whose convictions were subsequently quashed would not have been around to see that. You only have to look at the `Birmingham four' and the `Guildford six'. You only have to look at the number of commissions around Australia today, and the reports to the parliament, to see the level of corruption that exists and has now tainted some&mdash;not all&mdash;convictions. I am not a proponent of the death penalty&mdash;of state&hyphen;induced death&mdash;and I commend the government for putting that clause in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is proper and appropriate to acknowledge that it was the previous Attorney&hyphen;General, the Hon. Michael Lavarch, and the previous Minister for Justice who championed this clause going into the drafting instructions. It certainly enriches the legislation. It is the way it should be, and there should be no apologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not to say that there is not the odd critic or the odd person who does not believe in that clause. We are never going to have unanimous agreement. But I think it has been a considered discussion paper and it has been considered legislation. That is the way legislation in this area should be dealt with: it should be open to scrutiny. We, as a parliament, should be inviting public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be achieving cross&hyphen;party support where possible. These issues are above politics. These issues are important, and it is important that they be dealt with in a cross&hyphen;party manner. I commend the government, in this regard, for bringing this legislation in, and I do not apologise for that. Too often there is a misconception in the community that we are always fighting with one another and scoring cheap political points. The reverse is true. The tragedy is that the modern&hyphen;day reporting of parliament&mdash;indeed, the only reporting that the media are interested in doing&mdash;consists of the clashes that we have, because it is popular television stuff. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3467"> They are only interested in confrontation and not in consultation or conciliation. They are not interested in showing pictures of peaceful demonstrators, or whatever. The only good television, for them, is where an incident takes place, and that is not the way to deal with sensitive legislation such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we, as an opposition, are consistently getting up and supporting these pieces of legislation. It shows that, in this area, there has been cross&hyphen;party support, and that the legislation which we introduced was not bad legislation, because it has been picked up by the current government. They deserve the credit for that, and we will give credit where it is due. With those remarks, I commend the legislation to the committee and to the House. The opposition will assist in giving it speedy passage.</PARA></SPEECH>

Known criminal organisations and networks in Australia and other countries have increased in size and power. The technology they use is more difficult to log and monitor. Many criminal organisations have developed interests beyond their countries of origin. Organisations and networks based in other countries are now represented in Australia or have links with Australian&hyphen;based networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, in particular, has provided invaluable assistance to the Australian law enforcement authorities&mdash;including the federal and state police forces, the National Crime Authority and the Australian Customs Service&mdash;in the conduct of transnational criminal cases, particularly on crimes such as drug trafficking. The key to the amendments to the act provided for in this bill is the improvements which have come about as a result of consultation with law enforcement, legal and civil liberties organisations. I speak in particular of the measure that the member for Banks (Mr Melham) referred to at length. This is the critical measure which includes the provision that the Attorney&hyphen;General must refuse assistance from a foreign country if it relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with, or convicted of, an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This provision is extremely important because in practice, before, we were allowed avenues of refusal in respect of these circumstances if the matter was non&hyphen;specific to the death penalty. This provision will reflect Australia's policy, given that the death penalty has been abolished since 1984 in all Australian states and that we are party to the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This amendment does, however, allow the Attorney&hyphen;General discretion to grant assistance sought, if there are special circumstances in the particular case: for example, where the assistance sought is exculpatory in nature and establishes the innocence of, or else exonerates, the defendant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another key amendment allows for a residual non&hyphen;specific refusal ground where, in the opinion of the Attorney&hyphen;General, it is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case that the request for assistance should not be granted. Previously, assistance could only be granted to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3468"> countries to which the act applied by regulation, and regulations would only be made where Australia had faith in the criminal justice system of that particular country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously, a request for cooperation from a country not mentioned in our regulations could encounter a delay of at least eight weeks while regulations were made by the Federal Executive Council. Such a delay could considerably undermine the effectiveness of the act for investigative and prosecution agencies. Assistance can now be provided and requested much more expeditiously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments also deal with court applications by the defendant, restrictions on the use of information received, court&hyphen;to&hyphen;court applications to take evidence and other amendments mostly of a technical or mechanical nature. All will improve the operation of the act which has proved absolutely necessary for Australia to counter transnational crime, including drug trafficking and other forms of organised crime, and will also show us, in the international arena, as jealous of civil and political rights, which we hold most dear in this country. I therefore commend the bill to this committee and ask that it receive wholehearted support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 I would like to commend the substance of the majority bill as an obvious improvement in the development of our criminal justice relations with other nations. I have a number of concerns I would like to address in relation to aspects of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I want to answer a couple of the points made by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) when he talked about `hangers and floggers' as being the axis on which this bill rotates. Of course, there are some other issues related to the provisions of 8(1A) and 8(1B). The clause which concerns me is 8(1A) which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A request by a foreign country for assistance under this Act must be refused if it relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with, or convicted of, an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed in the foreign country, unless the Attorney&hyphen;General is of the opinion, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, that the assistance required should be granted.</PARA>
<PARA>The difficulty I have with that is that it effectively places a blanket ban, with very few exceptions, on the exchange of information in a particular circumstance relating to what may have been, for instance, a particularly heinous offence. It may relate to drug trafficking offences, for instance, in the case of some of our neighbours in South&hyphen;East Asia. In my view, it effectively puts an untenable restriction on some valuable exchanges of information in relation to our own criminal justice objectives&mdash;in particular, of course, the war against drug trafficking within our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can just make an observation, we are effectively losing the fight against the importation of illicit drugs. That has been acknowledged by a number of experts around the country, including the previous chairman of the National Crime Authority, Mr Tom Sherman, and a range of commentators whose expertise and knowledge is not in question. We have an extraordinary problem with the importation of drugs in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of Western Australia it has been calculated that each year up to $1 billion worth of illicit drugs comes across that part of the frontier that is Western Australia. There was a statistic a couple of years ago that, within a radius of 100 kilometres of Geraldton, $300 million worth of illicit drugs entered in one year. These are mind&hyphen;boggling statistics. When one considers the damage, the social effects and the dire necessity to combat this with the absolute maximum resources available to us, then quite clearly when we look at our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3469"> relationship with other nations, particularly those in our region, this bill starts to take a pivotal importance in that relationship and section 8(1A) then has significance and importance in our dealings with our neighbouring countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to acknowledge that the vast proportion of illicit drugs are coming from our immediate neighbourhood. They are essentially entering our shores from our own particular region. Our regional neighbours, in many instances, are making significant attempts to combat organised drug trafficking&mdash;a highly profitable and, of course, corrupting influence&mdash;within their own countries. Obviously, this is something that troubles them, as it troubles us. It seems to me that it makes it extraordinarily difficult for Australia to be able to participate fully in a cooperative arrangement within its own region when it introduces legislation that puts a blanket ban on assistance, which includes the exchange of information, matters to do with extradition, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act says that assistance must be refused `if it relates to the prosecution or punishment of a person charged with, or convicted of, an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed in the foreign country'. The reason for that is that a large number of countries, not only in our region but elsewhere, still retain the death penalty on their books. Some of the states of the United States actually impose a death penalty as part of their criminal justice processes. In relation to section 8(1A), clearly this should be amended in the interests of greater international cooperation in the fight against drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some aspects of this that may relate to the question of war crimes. As I have been advised, in relation to war crimes being dealt with by the United Nations, there are specific provisions that take away the death penalty for war crimes being investigated and subsequently prosecuted by the War Crimes Tribunal. But, as we know, that tribunal has a limited life. There are attempts to establish a standing war crimes commission but I believe that at the end of the day&mdash;I am sure there are a number of people who would agree with me&mdash;it is more likely that nations will use their own criminal justice systems to investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible, if convicted, for war crimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of countries in our region that are important in the fight against organised crime and drug trafficking. They include Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea&mdash;although it is abolitionist de facto&mdash;Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. There is also the United States of America and, in eastern Europe, Bosnia&hyphen;Herzegovina. There are a number of others on the list but I want to deal specifically with our immediate region, for obvious reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a conference held in Sydney in 1994 on organised crime in Asia, organised jointly by the National Crime Authority and the Australian Federal Police, there were a considerable number of complaints raised by representatives of agencies from our regional neighbours that this particular restriction&mdash;which has existed de facto up until now, and I commend the Attorney&hyphen;General for attempting to codify this in the act&mdash;has impeded better and more effective criminal investigations within our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the observation that our attitude is governed, to a certain extent, by our federal government's policy in relation to capital punishment. Of course, Australia is an abolitionist nation. Whatever one's view of capital punishment may be, the fact of the matter is that a number of our neighbouring nations have a different view. They have a view, of course, that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3470"> in cases of serious drug trafficking offences capital punishment ought to be available on their statute books. It is being made available most notably in Malaysia and Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That effectively means that, in the case where a person has been arrested and prosecuted in relation to an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed, the Attorney&hyphen;General must refuse assistance. That is, in my view, a blanket ban that not only is not conducive to better and more effective criminal justice investigation relations with those neighbouring nations, but also effectively makes the Attorney&hyphen;General's position more difficult. Of course, it provides for that `unless the Attorney&hyphen;General is of the opinion, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, that the assistance requested should be granted'. In other words, the requirement is that the circumstances should be sufficiently strong for the blanket ban to be overturned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter of some importance in the debate on the question of organised crime and drug trafficking. It is something that I think is a contentious issue. It is an issue that deserves a fuller debate. In my view, it deserves a debate in the main chamber of the House of Representatives. I believe it is important that the community sees that we are treating this matter with seriousness, that we are exploring its complete ramifications and, if and when the decision is made to amend the bill or to carry the bill in its current form, that it is made at the conclusion of a thoroughgoing and informative debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I for one would like to listen to the Attorney&hyphen;General's expanded views on this particular provision, so that he can explain them to members of the community, many of whom are disquieted about the international drug trafficking problem that exists in relation to our own country. I recently made a visit to Interpol and the National Criminal Intelligence Service in Britain, and know that international drug trafficking is a matter of growing concern and a matter that many leading criminal investigators from various agencies concede is causing extraordinary concerns around the world. The transnational nature of its activities makes it extraordinarily difficult for an individual nation to be able to stamp out or stop it within its own territory. That is why international cooperation and the exchange of information and evidence is absolutely critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, no&hyphen;one would expect the Attorney&hyphen;General to permit assistance in the case where, for instance, a country with a criminal justice system that is highly questionable was involved: where, for instance, the standards of evidence and other standards might be completely below what we would consider the acceptable minimum. Clearly, nobody would expect that to be the case. I believe, in the circumstances I have described, that with the amendment that would still be provided for. It is just that, in this particular instance, the `must' in line one of section 8(1A) is a blanket ban. It remains then for the case to be put that the special circumstances of the case are so overwhelming that that blanket ban should be overturned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many people around the country who very are concerned about our problems with drug trafficking. It is safe to say that drug trafficking is at the base of much criminal activity within our country. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine in June commented that you are more likely to be burgled, robbed or assaulted without a weapon in Australia than in the United States. For instance, in my state the statistics show that in some of the leading criminal activities the rate is almost twice the average of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one concludes that at the base of much of our criminal activity is drug trafficking, and I suppose the associated activities in relation to drug trafficking, if we do not make the fight against drugs our number one objective we are going to see some extraordinary problems in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3471"> the future&mdash;problems that will make our current situation seem small beer in comparison. Recent statistics that have been shown to me in the case of European countries show that they have seen a mushrooming of drug trafficking to an extent that is almost mind&hyphen;boggling, where criminal justice police agencies have little effect on being able to stop it or stamp it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know, for instance, even where one considers changes to the law to provide for the decriminalisation of marijuana or similar proposals that some people sincerely believe will help alleviate our drug problem in Australia, that the people responsible for trafficking drugs will cynically manipulate the market to provide cheaper, more pure, other drugs&mdash;for instance, heroin. The other day we saw in Western Australia the recovery of a bag of a substantial amount of an illicit drug&mdash;believed to be cocaine&mdash;on an inbound British Airways jet that had arrived at Perth. We are now faced, along with a number of other nations, with an explosion of drug trafficking. We are faced, in the case of the prevailing budget as of last night, with very substantial cuts to the Australian Federal Police, cuts that I believe will have a deleterious effect on our fight against drug trafficking and cuts that come in conjunction with cuts in other areas in recent times, particularly the Australian Customs Service and the National Crime Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In totality, these cuts are going to impede our fight against organised crime, but in particular our fight against drug trafficking. We have seen reported at the Wood royal commission the corruption of police, corruption of the judiciary, corruption of politicians and corruption of business people, and often at the base of this is the profit making that is available in the trafficking of illicit drugs. So it has a tremendous social effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a situation where, at this very point, we are prepared to let this particular bill travel through the Main Committee as a non&hyphen;contentious piece of legislation when section 8(1A) provides for a blanket ban on the assistance available in cases where we are dealing with a number of the nations in our region which have, in some instances, an equally strong commitment to the fight against drug trafficking. I make my case that this will impede rather than help that relationship and will not contribute to better cooperation between our countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drug trafficking is an international menace. Anybody who thinks otherwise ought to think again. It is transnational. It is, in many instances, a chain that stretches around the globe. If we believe for one minute that this particular section is going to assist our opportunity to participate in an international fight against drug trafficking then we really ought to think again. And if we believe that this is non&hyphen;contentious&mdash;in other words, should travel through the Main Committee without demur&mdash;then we also, I think, are failing the community. This ought to be back in the House of Representatives main chamber and, Mr Deputy Speaker, at the conclusion I intend to move that further proceedings be conducted in the House in order that amendments may be considered.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments on behalf the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) will not be long but I do, on his behalf, apologise that other commitments in the House have required him to be absent from the further consideration of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On his behalf I thank those who have spoken: the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone), and now the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). We welcome the support that has been offered by the opposition for the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act has been in force for almost 10 years. Clearly, as with any initiative, it is appropriate that its effectiveness and efficiency be reviewed and in that context we have this bill before us. There was wide&hyphen;ranging consultation in the review with the government, the private sector, law enforcement agencies and civil liberty groups. At the end of the day, this process has ensured that we have the best possible solutions in the form of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General is particularly grateful for the support of the opposition and the honourable member for Murray regarding the death penalty issue. The honourable member for Moore has, however, foreshadowed some concerns that he has in relation to this matter. I want to make it very clear that I do not think anybody in the parliament would demur on what he has had to say about the importance of fighting drug trafficking. The questions are: in what way do you deal with these particular issues and what impact might they have? This matter has been discussed with the Attorney&hyphen;General and I am informed that he is not prepared to agree to any amendments. Obviously, if this means the bill needs to be considered in detail in the Main Committee, that is an issue which will be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would, however, point out to the honourable member for Moore that section 8(1A) deals with the position specifically where charges have been laid and where a person is charged with or convicted of an offence in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed. His concerns about assistance in cases where charges have not been laid are dealt with in clause 8(1B) where there is a far broader discretion to provide the assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note also that I understand the Attorney&hyphen;General, in relation to 8(1A), has a discretion to grant assistance sought if there are special circumstances in the particular case. Normally assistance would not be granted unless the requesting state gave an assurance that the death penalty, if imposed, would not be carried out. I think there is a basis for dialogue where cooperation is sought. Cooperation would only be denied if a state were not willing to give the assurance that even if the death penalty was imposed it would not be carried out. To those who are interested in this question of what the role of the state ought to be in these matters that, to my way of thinking, does not seem to be an unreasonable basis upon which to deal with this difficult issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has considered the issues raised by the honourable member for Moore. It considers that it has the right solution and would ask that he reconsider his approach in relation to this matter so we can have the legislation. If he intends to persist with his amendment obviously he will seek the referral.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to see this particular instance becoming a debate between whether one supports the death penalty or otherwise; it is a question of whether or not the blanket ban imposed on subsection 8(1A) proposed by clause 41, as the amendment to the principal act, would in fact impede our relations with countries where the death penalty is still on the statute books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know, from having read the explanatory memorandum and from having had the opportunity of a briefing from officers of the department, that an assurance may be sought from the nation which has the particular penalty on the books that the death penalty will not be imposed. That would then be the basis on which assistance may be given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I am saying is that, in this particular instance, the blanket ban is the problem here. In my view, that should be changed from `must' to `may' and the last clause of section 8(1A), that is, `Unless the Attorney&hyphen;General is of the opinion. . . ' continuing until the full stop, should be deleted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, were this to be more widely debated in the community, many people around the country would have some serious problems with it. At the end of the day, we still have the provision allowing the Attorney&hyphen;General to refuse assistance; in other words, the Attorney&hyphen;General has the discretion available to him or her.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond briefly. The comments I made in relation to subclause 8(1A) were that the Attorney, under that subsection, does have a discretion to grant assistance sought if there are special circumstances and normally assistance would not be granted unless the requesting state gave an assurance that the death penalty, if imposed, would not be carried out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those circumstances, we are in a situation where, notwithstanding the use of the word `must', there is a basis upon which cooperation can be sought, and the government considers it reasonable that the condition of the offer of that assistance is not that the country concerned changes its system of law, but that it simply gives us an assurance that the death penalty, if imposed, would not be carried out. That does not seem to be an unreasonable requirement. And if the issues that you are saying are as important to those who are investigating these matters and have brought charges, it seems to me that that cooperation, if it is important, should not be difficult to obtain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in that context that we believe that this is a cooperative arrangement which can be operated to give assistance but which does not leave us in a situation where we are a party, in effect, to the application of a death penalty to people when we are in a position to aid the prosecution in relation to a particular matter. I am surprised that what is, in fact, a matter that has been the subject of very long consideration and consultation still worries the honourable member.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Moore)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.42 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason for the concern is the onerous requirement that, when requesting assistance, a nation that is in the process of prosecuting someone is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3474"> required to provide a guarantee that the death penalty will not be applied. In other words, Australia is asking that nation to adjust its criminal justice system to suit us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony is somewhat rich. We actually helped train the troops from a neighbouring country that has recently been responsible for killing innocent citizens of its own nation. Yet here, in the case of, say, a drug trafficker who is responsible for drug trafficking, we would impose a requirement that that nation provide a guarantee that the death penalty would not be applied in that particular case. In my view, that requirement is too onerous and it is an impediment to better cooperation in our region. And let's face it, on both sides of the political process both the previous government and the current government have obviously expounded on the greater relationship with our Asian neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I am saying is that this provision has in it an implication that we are asserting that in the case of, say, Malaysia or Singapore, aspects of their criminal justice system are so abhorrent to us that we would not cooperate in the investigation of a very serious offence. We are talking about offences ranging from murder to war crimes, and all the way through to, in some instances, very serious drug trafficking offences. My view is that at the end of the day, that would be seen to be a stumbling block in the way of better cooperative efforts at a time when we need cooperation. We do not want to put impediments in the way; we should be removing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, the Attorney&hyphen;General still has a discretion available in the amendments that I propose to move. We are not taking away that discretion. It is not a very onerous requirement to make a guarantee in relation to the prosecution of a person who has been arrested and charged with an offence in that particular category. That is all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) raising subsection 8(1B), I have no problem with it at all. It is just this particular section that I believe would attract a fair amount of interest and opposition from around the country from those who believe, as I do, that any of these sorts of impediments ought to be removed and that, at the end of the day, a blanket ban is not in our best interests.</PARA></SPEECH>

They are more concerned if, in your dealings with them, you leave them in some doubt as to where you stand in relation to these matters. And the purpose of this bill is to leave other countries, within the region and elsewhere, in no doubt as to where we stand in relation to assistance. We do not want to create false expectations. We think it is far better that we be explicit about the circumstances in which Australia will assist. In that sense, the proposals that we put are ones that we would insist upon.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Moore)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.48 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to answer a couple of those points. Firstly, I understand that the comments by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) are correct; I understand to what object this particular clause relates. I am just saying that, in this instance, I believe there should be discretion for the Attorney&hyphen;General in order to be able to consider the matter. If you look at it carefully&mdash;the wording says `unless the Attorney&hyphen;General is of the opinion, having regard to the special circumstances of the case'&mdash;there is no provision in there, in fact, for there to be a guarantee. It just mentions having regard to the special circumstances of the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The guarantee is a policy matter. It is a matter of international relations between Australia and whichever country is applicable. It does not codify there exactly what is required for the Attorney&hyphen;General to be satisfied of the special circumstances. But, from the explanatory memorandum, we know that that is in fact a guarantee by the nation concerned&mdash;the prosecuting nation&mdash;that the death penalty would not be applied in that case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand also that it relates to prosecution or punishment. The punishment is a secondary issue, and that is why I would still give the discretion to the Attorney&hyphen;General. It is a question of prosecution. I add that, as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs would know, in some of these cases during the prosecution evidence of the activities of accomplices is revealed. These might be accomplices within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that where there is a transnational conspiracy there is going to be the revealing of evidence that would perhaps give rise to, if the person were available, the prosecution of an Australian citizen. In that case, there is a clear provision there for the Attorney&hyphen;General to exercise his discretion. But there may also be evidence that Australians hold, or may be able to provide, that may facilitate the breaking of an international cartel of drug traffickers. It is my view that the onerous requirement imposed, not necessarily by the actual wording of the bill but by the policy statement in the explanatory memorandum, is too onerous. As a consequence, I propose the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not disagree with the minister. If one were to put it to a referendum, perhaps most Australians would support the abolition of the death penalty. I am sure they would support Australia's general policy to support its abolition wherever it can. But, at the same time, I think that there would be many in the community&mdash;I believe it would be the majority&mdash;who would also see an impedance like this as being outside that particular objective.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3476">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, this bill is designed to be a bill on mutual assistance in criminal matters, not a policy of Australia on trying to further its own particular conviction that capital punishment ought to be abolished. This is where we are endeavouring to arrive at agreements with other countries as to assistance relating to criminal investigation and criminal prosecutions. I repeat: all I am saying is that the blanket ban and the onerous requirement in the final clause of that particular section are an impedance. I am yet to be convinced by the minister at the table.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear that the honourable member is not convinced, and I am not endeavouring to join issue on every point that he makes, because I think I dealt with most of them before and there is a degree of repetition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other sections, as I indicated, in which cooperation can be sought. In relation to the conspiracy argument possibly involving Australians, section 8(1A) would not arise. We are dealing with a situation in which people would then be dealt with under our law. The application of our law in relation to the use of the evidence and information that we might have would be in relation to a prosecution of people here. So I do not understand the connection that the honourable member is trying to make regarding the argument of conspiracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will contain my remarks, save to emphasise that the honourable member is seeking to use discretionary words in relation to the general principle. The discretion is, in fact, obtained through the special circumstances in a particular case. As has been noted, where assistance will be offered is where a state has agreed that, if a prosecution which involves the death penalty is secured, an assurance that the death penalty will not be carried out will be sufficient to secure the cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does not seem to be at all unreasonable. It does involve an element of discretion that can be obtained through the willingness of two states to cooperate. I do not think the divisions are very significant. I am surprised that the member wants to persist with the matter, given what is said in the explanatory memorandum and the way in which the particular clause has been drafted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will of course not be opposing the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. Why would we? It is exactly the same bill that we introduced when in government in November last year. This debate also provides me with an opportunity to reflect briefly on the work and the contribution made by the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Con Sciacca. Regrettably, whilst Australia remembered in 1995, in 1996 they seem to have forgotten Con in his own electorate. I think it is one of the great pities of the recent election loss for the Australian Labor Party that Con Sciacca was not returned to this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have been travelling around, both in the company of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) and, indeed, on my own, from talking to people in the veterans community I have been absolutely staggered and overwhelmed by the comments made by the veterans in respect of the contribution made by Con Sciacca.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague rightly interjects, they in fact do adore him and in veterans' affairs that is not a state in which one easily finds oneself. I think that Con proved himself to be someone who was prepared to listen and mix and to fight battles on behalf of the veterans community. For those very reasons he was, and continues to be, much loved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that, in considering the legislation before the committee today, we again pay tribute to the work that Con did as minister: it was, after all, his legislation. I certainly commend the present government for continuing with this matter and for bringing it forward. As we have seen, there is absolutely no disagreement between the government and the opposition in respect of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The document itself, as was commented in the explanatory memorandum, actually gives effect to two particular matters. The first element is to amend the Defence Service Homes Act of 1918 and to incorporate certain provisions of the consumer credit code that is to be adopted by state and territory governments during the course of this year. It is also going to allow defence service homes scheme beneficiaries rights under the consumer credit code for matters not specified in this amending bill. The second element of this legislation is to amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act of 1986, to streamline the granting of a pension to a dependant of a veteran who dies from a war&hyphen;caused injury or disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take the second of those amendments first and comment briefly. I do not think that any member of parliament who has contact with the veterans community would not be aware of the trauma for many veterans in proving that illness, or some debilitation, is war related. Then, after they have succeeded in doing so, when they pass away their dependant is faced with that same element of proof. This amendment removes that. This amendment says that once it has been established that a veteran is entitled to some form of assistance, some pension, some entitlement under the veterans' affairs legislation and&mdash;having proved that beyond all reasonable doubt&mdash;is granted that entitlement, then the dependant of that veteran is similarly given that entitlement on the death of the applicant.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3478">
<PARA> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This is very significant and very important. It removes trauma. It is going to take away the difficulties often confronting dependants who have gone through the process of establishing an entitlement and receiving the benefit, together with the person in receipt of the benefit, but who then have that lifelong partner pass away. They are faced with the double whammy, if you like, of firstly having to cope with that and then having to go through the process again of establishing an entitlement. To remove that trauma is very important.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) interjects, it would be more difficult, once the original veteran who was given the entitlement passes away, to prove that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the government for adopting this measure, which was put in place and brought forward last year by the former government and by the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and I congratulate the government for continuing to ensure that veterans and, more importantly with this particular provision, their dependants, are given care, comfort and support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue concerns the amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. We know that consumer issues in financial services are ones which are very near and dear to the hearts of all of us. We are all consumers at the end of the day. It does not matter if you are a veteran, it does not matter if you are a member of parliament. What you want to know and what you want to be protected by are some guarantees in consumer codes in respect of all of your transactions with financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is particularly so in respect of the purchase of homes. After all, for most people the purchase of a home is in fact the acquiring of the largest asset that they are ever going to make a commitment for. One would hope, therefore, that when making that commitment they are given appropriate consumer guidance and that the decisions they make and any contractual obligations they enter into have force of law and, importantly, bring consumer benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment to the Defence Service Homes Act will give those additional benefits that states and territories are now adopting in respect of the Consumer Credit Code. Again I commend the government for bringing this forward as part of this legislation. It again follows on from legislation which the former government introduced last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, however, when in the context of last night's budget announcements one goes to budget statements and Budget Paper No. 1 to look at this issue of defence service homes. I want to raise very quickly one or two matters out of that, and would hope that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs might take on board a couple of the questions I am going to pose now because I think the veterans community would certainly like to hear from the minister on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At page 3&hyphen;126 of Budget Paper No. 1 there is reference to defence service homes in the forward estimates for 1996&hyphen;97. If one looks at the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, one sees that it is suggested that some $50.9 million will be made available for defence service homes but that in fact is a reduction of 1.4 per cent. Fortunately, in 1997&hyphen;98 the estimated expenditure in the forward estimates is going up again to $55.3 million, which estimates an 8.6 per cent increase, but it is estimated that in 1998&hyphen;99 expenditure will decrease again to $53.2 million, a reduction of 3.8 per cent. It is to go up marginally, by 0.8 per cent, to $53.6 million, according to the forward estimates for the 1999&hyphen;2000 budget.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3479">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It strikes me that this is a bit of a roller&hyphen;coaster ride. Perhaps it reflects trends in the marketplace which the Department of Veterans' Affairs is aware of. If that is the case, then obviously there is no concern and no cause for alarm. It is incumbent upon us&mdash;and I am speaking now as a member of parliament who will be approached by members of the veterans community rather than as the shadow minister&mdash;to know what this means and whether a smoothing out effect will ultimately occur. What that probably does reflect, as I have speculated, is changes in demand of the use of the program at different times, or perhaps interest rate fluctuations which the government is banking on. I am not sure whether that roller&hyphen;coaster ride over the next four years indicates when interest rates are likely to go up or come down&mdash;perhaps we might look at that a little more closely and all race out and purchase property! It is an issue that is of concern. I ask the minister to give us a response to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, at page 3&hyphen;127 of Budget Paper No. 1, under subprogram 7.2, `Defence Service Homes', it is noted under `home acquisition assistance' that the budget for 1996&hyphen;97 is $54.3 million, which represents a two per cent decrease on 1995&hyphen;96. Again, however, one sees a reflection of the roller&hyphen;coaster ride factor, which I mentioned with regard to the forward estimates, in that it is proposed that the amount increases by 7.2 per cent in 1997&hyphen;98, decreases by 1.2 per cent in 1998&hyphen;99, and increases by 0.9 per cent in the 1999&hyphen;2000 budget. I guess this reflects something of demand again. However, it would be appreciated if the minister could give us some indication about that so that the veterans community, and members of parliament who counsel veterans about these issues, will be better informed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing which is of concern to us all is the decision taken by the government to extract from departments a two per cent across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board running cost reduction. The minister could suggest to us what that might mean in terms of delivery of services by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to that very important group in the community that is in need of special care and assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that potentially we are going to see something like a 10 per cent reduction in staffing within the Department of Veterans' Affairs as a result of the decision that the government has taken to reduce running costs. I understand that one way in which departments have approached that&mdash;and we have seen headlines about it&mdash;is by cutting staff numbers. I appreciate that a simple way of doing that within departments is to follow that principle and shed staff. I would caution the Department of Veterans' Affairs, in looking at ways to achieve cost&hyphen;cutting measures, to reflect upon the delivery mechanism that might be impacted upon by such a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This cost cutting is imposed by the government. Make no mistake about it, the government says there has to be a two per cent reduction in running costs and the simple way to do that is to cut staff numbers. Obviously, the Department of Veterans' Affairs cannot be immune from that if it is to meet that objective. However, the close relationship between the staff of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the veterans community is more than simply a client&hyphen;service provider relationship. It is much closer than that. If you talk to any veteran about it, he will tell you how important it is to have access to people within the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope a reduction in service will not be brought about by this decision. We must not impede the ability of the department to continue to deliver services to the veterans community. It is too important generally, across a whole range of programs, for that to occur. I again raise that as an allied issue associated with this particular piece of legislation that is before us today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3480">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by again commending the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca, for his work in this portfolio. I congratulate the present minister, Mr Scott, for maintaining the commitment of this parliament, and not just the government, to the veterans community. Veterans' affairs is very much a bipartisan area. Regrettably, there are too few of those areas of bipartisanship that we can all reflect upon with some pride and sense of joy. When matters such as this are addressed by budgets or through legislation, we should not be afraid of coming out and commending the present government for any initiatives that it brings forward. I am doing so, and I wish this legislation a speedy passage through the House. I know it is supported by everybody and, as a consequence, wish it well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will comment briefly on the remarks made by the shadow minister concerning the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Con Sciacca. Like many other people in the House, I had a very warm and high regard for Con and the way in which he carried out his duties as Minister for Veterans' Affairs in a bipartisan way. I am well aware of the fact that on Remembrance Day last year he came to my electorate, opening a memorial walkway in Caloundra. As he recognised, the Sunshine Coast is not a hotbed of Labor support, and was never likely to be, yet he came to my area, as minister. I know that his visit was very warmly received by members of the veterans community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish Con a long and happy retirement outside politics. I am quite certain that he will be as successful in the business community, post&hyphen;politics, as indeed he was prior to entering parliament. I knew Con prior to his entry into politics, when both he and I were solicitors in Queensland. As I said, I wish him well in the future and certainly believe that he has the capacity to make a very great contribution to the business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I am confident that the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West), who was elected on 2 March, will do a wonderful job for a very long time on behalf of her constituents. While I have been very generous with my comments on Mr Sciacca and his performance as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I was very pleased to see the honourable member for Bowman win her seat as part of the landslide on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister indicated, this is largely a bipartisan area. I think it was one of the wartime Labor prime ministers who in effect said it was important&mdash;these are my words&mdash;that a grateful nation should be as generous as it possibly can be to those to whom we owe so much. I know over the years there has been a feeling in the veterans community from time to time that governments have not done as much as they should have done. I remember when I was in the parliament in the 1980s that there was a very great concern that the then Labor government was going to abolish the Department of Veterans' Affairs or maybe merge it with the Department of Social Security. That was a matter of great concern for many. Fortunately that issue worked its way through and that amalgamation never came to fruition. We now have a situation where both sides of politics recognise the important work done on behalf of the veterans community by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous minister should be commended on this bill, as indeed should his successor, because this is important legislation; legislation which will ensure that veterans continue to get a fair go from those who owe them so much. After all, as a nation, we enjoy freedom, stability and a way of life that is the envy of people throughout the world. I hate to think what would have been the situation in Australia if it had not been for the contribution made by those who now form part of our veterans community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3481">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was mentioned by the shadow minister, there are two arms to this legislation. The first arm relates to amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 which will ensure that, if it has been established that a veteran suffered from an injury or disease that was war caused, then the death of that veteran will also be taken to be war caused. I interjected on the shadow minister to point out how difficult it has been for dependants to prove that a death was war caused after the veteran has passed on. A primary source of evidence is lost, causing dependants to have to argue these cases before the tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been unfair and the legislation incorporating this change is very important. It brings a new level of fairness to the dependants of veterans and so I commend the government for ensuring that if a veteran has died from an injury or disease that has already been determined by the Repatriation Commission to be war caused, then that death is to be taken to have been war caused also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A large number of people have contacted me, in my capacity as the member for Fisher, in relation to aspects of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Now that this problem is being remedied many of my constituents will be very pleased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second arm of the legislation relates to amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. The Defence Service Homes Act is being amended to incorporate certain provisions of the Consumer Credit Code that will come into effect on 1 November 1996. Over the years there has been, quite appropriately in my view, increasing emphasis on the rights of consumers and the need to be fair to consumers. As the shadow minister pointed out, all Australians are consumers, and it is very important that consumers are protected under the laws of this land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the states and territories have been able to negotiate and achieve a situation where we are able to have a uniform Consumer Credit Code. It is appropriate that after the code comes into force those people eligible for housing assistance under the defence service homes scheme will gain consumer rights comparable to those of other borrowers. I do not think any reasonable person in the community&mdash;certainly nobody in the parliament&mdash;is suggesting that that should not be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One fairly important aspect of the Consumer Credit Code addressed by the bill is the payment of loan interest subsidy to the Westpac Banking Corporation, which provides defence service home loans to veterans and other eligible people under an agreement with the Commonwealth. Prior to this arrangement being entered into with the Westpac Banking Corporation, loans were made directly by the Commonwealth to veterans. The former government made a positive move when it effectively contracted these matters out to the Westpac Bank and I am pleased that that bank is going to continue to provide subsidised defence service home loans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a number of complaints from veterans who say that perhaps the level of the loan has not been increased in line with the increases in the prices of homes over the years. Once, of course, a defence service home loan could be the primary source of finance for a home buyer, but in more recent times that has not been the case. The Commonwealth currently pays the subsidy in advance. Under the code the subsidy will be paid in arrears and the Commonwealth will make a one&hyphen;off saving of some $4 million. The changes made pursuant to this legislation are very important. It is also important that the Westpac Bank has agreed that it will grant all existing loan borrowers the same rights, effectively, as will apply to new loan borrowers; that is, people will have the opportunity to have the daily balance method of interest calculation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3482">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my years of legal practice I have had to review mortgages that people have previously entered into, and it has been a source of concern to me that at times these mortgages provided for interest to be paid not necessarily at monthly rests but at three&hyphen;monthly rests or six&hyphen;monthly rests and sometimes even at annual rests. That has meant, in many cases, that if a person is a day or two late in making a payment, another three, six or 12 months interest was paid to the mortgagee as a windfall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think that any reasonable person in a society could suggest that that was a reasonable situation. So I am very pleased that not only will new loan borrowers be protected by the Consumer Credit Code but also the Westpac Bank, while it was under no obligation to do so, has agreed&mdash;presumably in the interests of simplification but I hope also in the interests of equity and fairness&mdash;to extend this right of a daily balance method of interest calculation to existing borrowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the amendments currently being proposed will postpone slightly the date by which this new method of calculating interest on loans will apply to existing borrowers. Originally the date when this was to happen was either the uniform Consumer Credit Code commencement date or 1 November 1996. This has now been extended to 1 June 1997. There obviously could be a small number of borrowers who might be adversely affected by the delay in this change, but I consider that the overwhelming benefit of helping all existing borrowers to have a daily form of calculation probably well and truly outweighs the minor inconvenience to some as a result of the delay in implementation of this very positive move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to commend not only the former government but also the current government and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) on supporting this legislation. It is important legislation for the veterans community. As a nation we must be as generous as we can to those who have served this nation and have ensured that as a country we are really one of the most fortunate places in the world in which to live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to resuming my seat, though, I would like to touch briefly on matters just mentioned in passing by the shadow minister when he referred to budget estimates. The shadow minister probably provided his own explanation of the varying amounts of money which will be made available in relation to certain expenditure of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The fact of the matter is that the minister has been able to go in there and has been able to fight on behalf of the veterans community and I think the veterans community by and large would be very pleased with what is included in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, as a government, inherited a black hole of $10.3 thousand million&mdash;$10.3 billion&mdash;and clearly this government is determined that for the first time in 13 years there should be a return to responsible economic management. Thus the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the budget handed down in fact found savings of well over $7 billion. I think that the veterans community and we as members of parliament should be very pleased that the veterans budget has been kept largely intact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, as the shadow minister mentioned, there has been a two per cent reduction, but then I understand that that reduction has been applied across the board. It should be appropriate for the Department of Veterans' Affairs to look very closely at its budget and, in doing so, it should ensure that there is no reduction in services of a substantial nature to the veterans community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand that the shadow minister might not like the two per cent reduction. Perhaps none of us like the fact that there has been a two per cent reduction, but the simple fact of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3483"> the matter is that the former government, prior to the election, told us that, effectively, the budget situation was that it was in surplus. We came into office, we inherited this massive great big Beazley black hole of $10.3 thousand million and obviously as a government we had to&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is very positive legislation. As I indicated earlier, there are two arms to this bill&mdash;amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Both sides of politics agree with these amendments, which will ensure that, if a veteran has died from an injury or disease that has already been determined by the Repatriation Commission to be war caused, then the death will be taken to have been war caused also.

<ELECTORATE> (Isaacs)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.25 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) and, without wishing to be too repetitive, I intend to be equally brief. I support the bill on the same basis that it was supported by the previous speakers, notably the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). It was a fine piece of Labor reform to veterans' affairs legislation which was introduced by the former federal government in November of last year. The underlying thrust of the bill is to safeguard the interests of veterans and their families and to minimise any action needed to grant certain claims for pensions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does this by giving effect to two fundamental pieces of veterans' affairs legislation, one of which relates, as has been stated by previous speakers, to the amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918, which ensure that loan beneficiaries under this defence service homes scheme will have consumer rights similar, if not identical, to those of other borrowers. They will have those when all state and territory governments adopt the common Consumer Credit Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will also incorporate provisions of the code that are to be adopted by all state and territory governments throughout the course of this year and will give the defence service home beneficiaries rights under this code for matters not specified in the amending bill. Subsidised defence service home loans are available to veterans and other eligible people under a contractual arrangement, as has been alluded to by the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), between the Commonwealth and Westpac Banking Corporation. The bill identifies sections of that code that Westpac should not apply to such loans in order to preserve the scheme's benefits, and they are detailed in full in the bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3484">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, one of those would include a veteran's age affecting his opportunity to get a loan elsewhere. That must be taken into account, for example, if and when the bank decides whether to provide the veteran with such a defence service home loan. As was put by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in his second reading speech, the concurrent operation of the Consumer Credit Code will not be limited, except for matters set out in the bill. This particular aspect of the legislation goes also to the question of interest charges on loans and, as has been quite clearly submitted to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that will be linked to daily balances instead of monthly balances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In moving amongst members of the veterans community, I know that veterans fully support the concept of ongoing housing assistance. In a survey undertaken by the previous federal government throughout the course of last year, such assistance was rated particularly highly by all the veterans groups which were surveyed. I know that younger clients, and specifically serving members, were less likely at that time to rate the existing housing arrangements as good because it was their view that increased loan amounts and interest payment subsidies to veterans are the most important improvements. I urge the government to pursue those improvements as a matter of ongoing reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As put to me by veterans, subsidised loans for both home modification and rent assistance are currently important. They will, I am sure, remain important in the minds of veterans and perhaps become increasingly important over the course of the next five or 10 years, during which time subsidised loans&mdash;for example, for retirement village accommodation&mdash;and the extension of loans to cover other types of housing will also increase in importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally briefly, the other aspect of veterans legislation to which this bill proposes amendment is that going to the issue of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, and it has been quite clearly put by both the member for Cunningham and the member for Fisher. The amendment to this legislation relates to the dependant of a veteran who dies from a war&hyphen;caused disability becoming eligible for a pension without the need for the service relationship to be re&hyphen;established. This, of course, will streamline the granting of a pension to a dependant of a veteran who dies from a war&hyphen;caused injury or disease, and will eliminate the very time consuming and often stressful task of retracing a veteran's war service injury and illness in order to establish those links.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that veterans are also very supportive of the pensions process operating under the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and they deem in general that it and the appeals process are fair. Some may consider from time to time that the appeals process is a little awkward to follow and perhaps difficult to understand&mdash;which may prevent some veterans from applying or from appealing against certain decisions. Once again, those veterans appeals processes may be a matter that the current federal government could undertake to investigate and assess. I know that those veterans who do apply, and who often subsequently submit appeals, do so on the basis that they may, for example, be motivated by more than one factor. While most veterans apply because of an increasing disability&mdash;and often the underlying basis of many appeals is that that disability is not recognised&mdash;another key motivation is a sense that they deserve and need more money to get by on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this piece of what is effectively Labor legislation is commended to the Committee on the basis that it is a necessary piece of reform. I congratulate both the much loved previous minister, Con Sciacca, and the current minister for proceeding to implement it. I know that, as I move about in the electorate of Isaacs, some of the clubs in that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3485"> electorate&mdash;including Mentone, Edithvale, Aspendale, Chelsea, Carrum and Cranbourne&mdash;provide a great service to veterans, young and old. It is on behalf of those veterans, members of those clubs&mdash;who fought so bravely in so many theatres of war around the world for the freedom of our great country, and with whom I recently remembered and commemorated the diggers who fought so heroically and so inspirationally 30 years ago during the tragic battle of Long Tan&mdash;that I support the bill. I know that those diggers would also urge me to support this bill. It is on that basis that I commend it to the Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.34 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I speak in support of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). I am sure its passage will be greeted with some relief by veterans throughout Australia. Schedule 1 of the bill ensures that there is greater equity for loan beneficiaries under the defence service homes scheme to have the same consumer rights as those enjoyed by the broader community. In the words of the explanatory memorandum to the legislation, `any potential conflict' between the Defence Services Homes Act 1918 and the consumer credit legislation will also be removed. With the agreement between the Commonwealth and the Westpac Banking Corporation, the bank will advance home loans to those deemed eligible under the Defence Services Homes Act 1918.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a related development, all state and territory governments have agreed to enact legislation for a consumer credit code during 1996. This code applies to all credit provided in the course of business of a credit provider to a borrower who is an individual or strata corporation and if the credit is provided wholly or predominantly for personal, domestic or household purposes. The bill ensures that Westpac Banking Corporation's legal obligations under the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 largely comply with the requirements of the Consumer Credit Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will come into effect from 1 November this year. After this time, people eligible for housing assistance under the defence services homes scheme will gain consumer rights comparable with those of other borrowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 of the act is what I consider to be a very important piece of legislation that corrects some ambiguities of the 1986 Veterans' Entitlements Act. It will mean that the dependants of a veteran who has died from a disability already accepted as war&hyphen;caused will be eligible for a pension without the relationship between the veteran's death and the war service having to be re&hyphen;established. A claim for a pension by or for a dependant of a veteran who died from a war&hyphen;caused injury or disease will be granted immediately, once the connection is identified, without reference to the statement of principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because claims for dependant pensions have to be determined by the statement of principles and prepared by the repatriation medical authority, often with  additional investigation, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) has commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A veteran's death from a war&hyphen;caused disability is now no guarantee that his or her dependants will have access to repatriation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>He has also said that `this uncertainty is unacceptable' and that the changes brought about by this legislation `will reassure veterans and their families that financial support will continue to be available should a veteran die from a previously accepted, war&hyphen;caused disability.' At a time of bereavement, obviously this will be a huge relief for the families involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The RSL has written to me stating that `this is a considerable win for the RSL and the veteran community.' As the RSL has also said, credit is due to Dr Allan Hawke, former secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and the former minister, Con Sciacca, who initiated this corrective action.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3486">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had my attention drawn to a situation where the passing away of a veteran resulted in the war widows pension to the surviving dependant being held up and put in jeopardy until she submitted a new claim. This must have been a very stressful time for her. This legislation will ensure that such an unfortunate situation will not repeat itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has already been said by other speakers in the Committee today, the veterans community is important to us. We were, of course, reminded of that very much last year during Australia Remembers. I do commend Con Sciacca, as others have done today, particularly for the part that he played in that commemoration. As the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) said, Con Sciacca did achieve a bipartisan approach. I found him to be a minister that one could approach in the corridor and say that some veteran needed some attention. He would say, `Put it in writing,' and the matter seemed to get fixed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that was a good reminder last year. Last Sunday the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and I were at the same function where I was representing the minister&mdash;whom I am pleased to see has arrived in the Committee&mdash;at the unveiling and dedication of the Korea&hyphen;South&hyphen;East Asia memorial. Of course, that was a particularly important day for Vietnam veterans because the memorial was unveiled on the 30th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan when Australian soldiers displayed the same courage and heroism as others had displayed in previous wars.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to mention that there is another issue that the previous minister charged me to do something about and about which I have been in contact more recently with the current minister. That is doing something about the fact that there is no memorial to the ex&hyphen;servicewomen in South Australia or certainly not in Adelaide. We are working on that now, Minister, not only with your cooperation, but with the cooperation of the state government and the Adelaide City Council. I think the veterans community enjoys bipartisan support. That is the way it should be. We all owe them a great deal. People from both sides of the chamber have taken part in this debate and I welcome the positive change it will bring to the lives of veterans and their families to whom this country owes a great debt.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to, firstly, in summing up, thank the members from both sides of the parliament for their contribution to this bill. It is an important bill. Although for many it may seem that minor amendments are being made, they are, nonetheless, very important and significant to the veteran community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation was introduced into the House on 22 May and at the end of the day the changes it proposes will safeguard the interests of veterans and their families and minimise action needed to grant claims for pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to run through some of the issues that were raised during the debate, referring firstly to the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) and his contribution. Before dealing in detail with the contribution by the shadow minister, I would like to say that he accompanied me to Australia Remembers and Revisits <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3487"> Vietnam 30 Years On in Vietnam last week. He was certainly a valuable contributor to the commemoration program. I was pleased to see that the honourable member for Cunningham was able to be part of that very important and historic visit to Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be presenting a report to the parliament in the next sitting on the visit to Vietnam, so I will not go into any great detail on that, but I thank the honourable member for Cunningham for his participation in what was indeed an historic and memorable commemoration in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Cunningham sought comments on budget items on page 3&hyphen;126 with reference to the defence service home forward estimates jumping up and down. This really is quite normal under the circumstances and has quite a lot to do with the way the loans are now calculated. They used to be paid in advance and now will be paid in arrears. So that reflects the different method which this bill is going to allow to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some cases, also, loans are being paid out by veterans and obviously new ones are being taken out and changed around in that manner. That means that these payments will be reflected in the manner in which people are utilising the facility. I hope that gives the honourable member for Cunningham some understanding of why those figures do vary and are not consistent from year to year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same applies to his second question relating to page 3&hyphen;127, which refers to home acquisition assistance. There is obviously a flow&hyphen;on effect from the way the interest subsidy used to be paid in advance and is now going to be in arrears. So there is a flow&hyphen;on effect to that second question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the decision to save two per cent across the board, the member for Cunningham asked whether it equalled a 10 per cent reduction in staffing and what impact it would have on veterans. I appreciate his comments in terms of the importance of the department's staff. I have certainly had&mdash;wherever I have been&mdash;wonderful support from the department's staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do an excellent job and they are extremely well received by the veteran community, and that is a great credit to the department. Bureaucrats are often criticised by the general population. This is not the case with the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and I know that the veterans themselves have a very close association with the staff of the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cunningham asked, `Does the decision to save two per cent across the board equate to a 10 per cent cut in staffing?' Well, whilst we are looking at doing things smarter and thinking smarter about the delivery of programs in the future, it is not all about cutting staff. It is certainly about cutting out unnecessary waste. It is also about improved technology, which can often lead to doing things better. It is often, in some cases, possible to buy a service rather than be a service deliverer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, whilst the two per cent across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board savings are very important in terms of the context of the budget, there is not always a 10 per cent reduction in staff as the Community and Public Sector Union&mdash;I was thinking of that other group of unions that was bashing on the doors of Parliament House earlier this week&mdash;would have you believe. Let me assure the member for Cunningham that any savings are designed to create a more efficient department; they are not going to be at the expense of delivering the best possible service to the veterans to whom this nation owes a great debt of gratitude. It is a debt that I do not believe will ever adequately be repaid, but it is one that we must continue to honour. So let me assure the shadow minister of that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3488">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one little thing that I would say to the shadow minister&mdash;I see him walking into the Main Committee room. One of the things that I have been told by members of the veteran community is that they really do object to being referred to as `clients'. They really would like to be called `veterans' rather than `clients' and I am encouraging my department to use the word `veteran' rather than `client'. I know it is difficult at times. I know it is very difficult to describe people: are they `clients', `customers' or `veterans'? But it is one thing that I ask all members of parliament, on both sides, to look at where possible, as the use of `veteran' might be far more acceptable to this very deserving section of our Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) and the member for Cunningham both commended the previous minister on his work as Minister for Veterans' Affairs. On a number of occasions, when addressing ex&hyphen;service organisations' annual meetings around this country, I have also commended the previous minister on the work he did in the portfolio. I will not go on any further now, but I thank them for those very sincere comments on the previous minister's work in this portfolio. They were reflected on both sides of the parliament. I think it reflects a genuine desire in the parliament to be as bipartisan as possible with the portfolio of Veterans' Affairs. That does not mean to say that we are not going to, from time to time, have some disagreement on issues. But I do note that both the member for Cunningham and the member for Fisher commended Con Sciacca on the work that he did in the portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I want to acknowledge the work that all members in this House do for the veterans in their communities. I know that this nation is still in debt to the veterans, both young and old, for the manner in which they gave us this great freedom. This democracy we all enjoy came at a price. We must continue to support our veterans. I thank members on both sides of the House for their contributions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) and (2) Australia is able to grant extradition to countries to which the Extradition Act 1988 applies. Application of the Extradition Act to a country gives legal force in Australia to extradition arrangements concluded by Australia with another country. These arrangements are of different kinds, with bilateral treaties being only one example. Thus the Extradition Act may be applied to give effect to bilateral extradition treaties, various `less than treaty status' arrangements, British extradition treaties dating from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries inherited by Australia, and extradition obligations arising under multilateral conventions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that the question concerns Australia's general extradition arrangements with the ASEAN countries and countries in the Western Pacific region. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3492"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASEAN</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASEAN countries include Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei Darussalam, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's extradition arrangements with Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam are governed by the Commonwealth Scheme for the Rendition of Fugitive Offenders, the London Scheme. An extradition arrangement under the London Scheme is a `less than treaty status' arrangement under which the extradition laws of one Commonwealth country are applied to the other in the absence of a treaty. Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam are declared under the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Regulations to be extradition countries for the purposes of the Extradition Act. Australia's extradition laws were applied to Malaysia and Singapore on 1 May 1967 and to Brunei Darussalam on 3 May 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a non-treaty extradition arrangement with Thailand. The Extradition Act was applied to Thailand in the absence of a treaty on 6 December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a modern bilateral extradition treaty with Indonesia. The Treaty was signed at Jakarta on 22 April 1992 and came into force on 21 January 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia also has a modern extradition treaty with the Philippines. That Treaty was signed at Manila on 7 March 1988 and came into force on 18 January 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has no bilateral extradition relationship with Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Western Pacific Region</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the countries in the Western Pacific region are Commonwealth countries. Australia's extradition arrangements with those countries are governed by the London Scheme and the Extradition Act applies to such countries under the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Regulations on a non-treaty basis. Examples of Commonwealth countries with such extradition arrangements include the Cook Islands, Western Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Nauru, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Australian extradition laws were applied to Western Samoa, Kiribati, Nauru, the Solomon Islands and Tonga on 17 December <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1970, to Papua New Guinea on 28 November 1975, to Vanuatu on 3 May 1985 and to the Cook Islands on 27 May 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a non-treaty extradition arrangement with Fiji and the Marshall Islands. Previously, the Extradition Act applied to Fiji under the London Scheme. Some time after Fiji left the Commonwealth, the Extradition Act was applied to the Republic of Fiji on 23 May 1991 under the Extradition (Republic of Fiji) Regulations. Australia's extradition laws were applied to the Marshall Islands in the absence of a treaty on 30 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a modern extradition treaty with France which entered into force on 23 November 1989. That Treaty facilitates extradition between Australia and French territories in the Pacific, such as French Polynesia and New Caledonia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All extradition treaties and arrangements between Australia and other countries operate subject to Australia's Extradition Act 1988. The Extradition Act creates a mechanism for the processing of extradition requests in Australia. The Act sets out the matters that Australian courts have to consider before ruling on a person's eligibility for extradition. The Act also sets out the matters that the Attorney-General must consider in deciding whether a person is to be surrendered to another country. The Act contains all the internationally-accepted human rights safeguards that are now a part of modern extradition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The question seeks information about extradition discussions initiated with other countries in the region. Extradition discussions with another country are aimed at establishing an extradition treaty with that country. It is not appropriate to disclose this due to the international practice that bilateral treaty negotiations are considered confidential between the parties until such time as a treaty is signed. This practice of not publicising bilateral treaty negotiations is recognised in the Government's recently announced policy on greater Parliamentary involvement in Australia's treaty&hyphen;making processes. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3493"> Consequently, it is not appropriate for me to identify countries with which Australia is currently negotiating extradition arrangements.</PARA>

For example, some countries, particularly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3494"> those having a religious basis to family law, view the Convention as inappropriate to their interests. Nevertheless, we have recently received indications that three of the countries listed above are positively disposed to the Convention and are likely to become parties once domestic legislation has been implemented, and others may become more disposed to the Convention if representations by posts are continued. The process of enactment of domestic legislation, followed in some cases by parliamentary approval of accession, may however cause further delays in those countries referred to above.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) In relation to the Red Cross conventions, Australia made the following declarations:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On ratification of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (August 12, 1949) on 14 October 1958, Australia made the following declaration:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . .and declares that it interprets the term "military installations" in paragraph 2 of Article 68 of the said Convention as meaning installations having an essential military interest for an Occupying Power."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On ratification of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol 1) on 21 December 1991, Australia made the following declarations:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"In depositing its instrument of ratification for Protocol 1, Australia hereby makes declarations of understanding in relation to Articles 5, 44 and 51 to 58 inclusive of the said Protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is Australia's understanding that in relation to Article 5, with regard to the issue whether, and in what measure, Protecting Powers may have to exercise any functions within the combat zone (such as may be implied by provisions in Parts II and IV of the Protocol), the role of the Protecting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Power will be of a like character to that specified in the First and Second Conventions and Part II of the Fourth Convention, which apply mainly to the battlefield and its immediate surroundings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the understanding of Australia that in relation to Article 44, the situation described in the second sentence of paragraph 3 can exist only in occupied territory or in armed conflicts covered by paragraph 4 of Article 1. Australia will interpret the word "deployment" in paragraph 3 (b) of the Article as meaning any movement towards a place from which an attack is to be launched. It will interpret the words "visible to the adversary" in the same paragraph as including visible with the aid of binoculars, or by infra&hyphen;red or image intensification devices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to Articles 51 to 58 inclusive it is the understanding of Australia that military commanders and others responsible for planning, deciding upon, or executing attacks, necessarily have to reach their decisions on the basis of their assessment of the information from all sources, which is available to them at the relevant time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to paragraph 5(b) of Article 51 and to paragraph 2(a)(iii) of Article 57, it is the understanding of Australia that references to the "military advantage" are intended to mean the advantage anticipated from the military attack considered as a whole and not only from isolated or particular parts of that attack and that the term "military advantage" involves a variety of considerations including the security of attacking forces. It is further the understanding of Australia that the term "concrete and direct military advantage anticipated", used in Articles 51 and 57, means a bona fide expectation that the attack will make a relevant and proportional contribution to the objective of the military attack involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the understanding of Australia that the first sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 52 is not intended to, nor does it, deal with the question of incidental or collateral damage resulting from an attack directed against a military objective."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to other human rights conventions, I have understood the honourable member's question to mean the major UN human rights treaties to which Australia is a party. The treaties which come within this category and in relation to which Australia has made reservations or declarations upon ratification or accession are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 7 March 1966. On ratification of the Convention on 30 September 1975, Australia made the following declaration:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Government of Australia . . . . . . .declares that Australia is not at present in a position specifically to treat as offences all the matters covered by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3495"> article 4(a) of the Convention. Acts of the kind there mentioned are punishable only to the extent provided by the existing criminal law dealing with such matters as the maintenance of public order, public mischief, assault, riot, criminal libel, conspiracy and attempts. It is the intention of the Australian Government, at the first suitable moment, to seek from Parliament legislation specifically implementing the terms of article 4(a)."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 16 December 1966. On ratification of the Convention on 13 August 1980, Australia made the following reservations and declaration:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 10</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"In relation to paragraph 2 (a) the principle of segregation is accepted as an objective to be achieved progressively. In relation to paragraph 2(b) and 3 (second sentence) the obligation to segregate is accepted only to the extent that such segregation is considered by the responsible authorities to be beneficial to the juveniles or adults concerned."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 14</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Australia makes the reservation that the provision of compensation for miscarriage of justice in the circumstances contemplated in paragraph 6 of article 14 may be by administrative procedures rather than pursuant to specific legal provision."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 20</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia interprets the rights provided for by article 19, 21 and 22 as consistent with article 20; accordingly, the Commonwealth and the constituent States, having legislated with respect to the subject matter of the article in matters of practical concern in the interest of public order (ordre public), the right is reserved not to introduce any further legislative provision on these matters."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Declaration</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Australia has a federal constitutional system in which legislative, executive and judicial powers are shared or distributed between the Commonwealth and the constituent States. The implementation of the treaty throughout Australia will be effected by the Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities having regard to their respective constitutional powers and arrangements concerning their exercise."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 18 December 1979. Upon ratification of the Convention on 28 July 1983, Australia made the following declaration and reservations:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Australia has a federal constitutional system in which legislative, executive and judicial powers are shared or distributed between the Commonwealth and the Constituent States. The implementation of the Treaty throughout Australia will be effected by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Commonwealth State and Territory Authorities having regard to their respective constitutional powers and arrangements concerning their exercise."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Government of Australia states that maternity leave with pay is provided in respect of most women employed by the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria. Unpaid maternity leave is provided in respect of all other women employed in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere to women employed under Federal and some State industrial awards. Social security benefits subject to income tests are available to women who are sole parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government of Australia advises that it is not at present in a position to take the measures required by article 11 (2) (b) to introduce maternity leave with pay or with comparable social benefits throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government of Australia advises that it does not accept the application of the Convention in so far as it would require alteration of Defence Force policy which excludes women from combat and combat&hyphen;related duties. The Government of Australia is reviewing this policy so as to more closely define "combat" and "combat&hyphen;related duties."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 20 November 1989. Upon ratification of the Convention on 17 December 1990, Australia made the following reservation:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Australia accepts the general principles of article 37. In relation to the second sentence of paragraph (c), the obligation to separate children from adults in prison is accepted only to the extent that such imprisonment is considered by the responsible authorities to be feasible and consistent with the obligation that children be able to maintain contact with their families, having regard to the geography and demography of Australia. Australia, therefore ratifies the Convention to the extent that it is unable to comply with the obligation imposed by article 37 (c)."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) and (3) The declaration made when Australia ratified the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War has not since been considered. No progress has been made on withdrawing or modifying this declaration, and there is no present intention to withdraw or modify it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The declarations made when Australia ratified Protocol 1 Additional to the Geneva Conventions were last considered prior to ratification on 21 June 1991. No progress has been made in withdrawing or modifying these declarations. The declarations were considered appropriate at the time of ratification, and are still considered appropriate, as the circumstances ruling at that time have not material <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3496"> ly altered. Accordingly there is no present intention to withdraw or modify them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The declaration made when Australia ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination was last considered in 1995. Withdrawal of the declaration is not possible at this stage. Article 4 (a) of the Convention contemplates the enactment of criminal offences for racial hatred and incitement to racial discrimination. As the Racial Hatred Act 1995 contains only a civil prohibition on such conduct, it does not fulfil Australia's obligations under Article 4 (a) and therefore is not sufficient to allow Australia to withdraw its reservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of withdrawing or modifying the reservations made when Australia ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is considered every year when Australia's National Action Plan on human rights is updated. Paragraph (c) of the National Action Plan requires Australia to indicate human rights treaty reservations we intend to remove. In relation to the reservation to Articles 10 (2) and (3) of the Covenant, due to Australia's demographic and geographical features it is difficult to achieve the total segregration of accused and convicted prisoners, and children or juvenile prisoners from adult prisoners. Furthermore the Australian Government remains convinced that it is appropriate to allow the responsible authorities discretion to determine whether it is beneficial for a child or juvenile to be imprisoned with adults. However the Government is committed to achieving the goal of separation of accused and convicted prisoners. Given the above, there are no present intentions to withdraw or modify Australia's reservations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the reservation to Article 14 of the Covenant, the Australian Government advises that there are administrative procedures available in all Australian jurisdictions to provide compensation for miscarriages of justice in the circumstances envisaged in the Covenant. Accordingly, the reservation to Article 14 is still considered appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reservations made when Australia ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women are currently being considered by the Government. It is not known at this stage when a final decision will be taken on withdrawal or modification, and what that decision will be. The declaration made by Australia on ratification of the Convention is still considered appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of withdrawing or modifying the reservation made when Australia ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child is considered every year when Australia's National Action Plan on human rights is updated. In relation to the reservation to Article 37 (1) of the Convention, due to Australia's demographic and geographical <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> features it is difficult to achieve the total segregration of children or juvenile prisoners from adult prisoners.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes, I am aware of Amcor's proposed expansion to its Maryvale paper mill. I welcome Amcor's announcement as it represents a strong vote of confidence in the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The current labelling requirement for paper products, made under the Commerce (Imports) Regulations of the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905, is that all imported paper, which is packed for sale on the basis of the number of sheets of paper in the package, must indicate the paper's country of origin. This information is to be marked on the packages in which the goods are packed for sale and, as set out in regulation 8, must be `affixed in a prominent position' in `prominent and legible characters'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not aware of any anomalies in the current regulations which would enable importers to compete unfairly with Amcor, the sole Australian manufacturer of copy paper. However, approximately 12 months ago, in response to industry and union representations, the Australian Customs Service targeted imported paper to examine compliance with the regulations. This investigation found that the bulk of paper imports examined were labelled in a manner required by the Commerce (Imports) Regulations and the country of origin was shown prominently and legibly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Costs under the ANSTO contract with UKAEA Dounreay cover the spent fuel reprocessing, uranium recovery, cemented waste storage and a range of associated activities, and will total around $5.9 million. Further costs of $920,000 were incurred for the shipment, including ship hire and the use of State personnel. These costings are the best estimate available at this time given that many of the incoming bills involve payment in a foreign currency and are dependent on the exchange rate at the date of payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No decisions have been made regarding further shipments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No. Neither the Government nor ANSTO announced a date on which the shipment would leave Australia. In the Public Environment Report, released in October 1995, ANSTO proposed the transfer of an initial shipment of spent nuclear fuel rods around June 1996. In early 1996, the UK authorities advised ANSTO that they required the proposed shipment to be sent as soon as possible for it to be included in their current reprocessing program. The shipment of 114 fuel rods left Sydney on 19 April 1996 and docked in Scotland on 16 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Within 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Approximately 17 cubic metres of cemented long lived intermediate level waste known as Category S waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) In view of the considerable time before a facility is required for the returned waste from Dounreay, no review of potential storage sites has as yet been conducted. The storage of Category S wastes at Woomera has demonstrated that it is possible to safely store this category of radioactive waste in existing structures. However, if there is no suitable existing building, a purpose built facility will be required.</PARA>
