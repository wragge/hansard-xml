<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So soon it seems after the senseless killings at Port Arthur in Tasmania, our country last week was struck by another tragedy. Last Wednesday, 12 June 1996, 18 soldiers died during a demanding counter-terrorist training exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At about 7 p.m. that evening, two helicopters of the 5th Aviation Regiment carrying troops from the Special Air Service Regiment collided and crashed near Townsville. Ten <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more men were injured&mdash;three very seriously. In one of our worst peacetime disasters&mdash;and the worst involving defence personnel since the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> collision of the 1960s&mdash;Australia lost 18 from amongst the finest and most professional men in the entire Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifteen were from the Special Air Service Regiment, which is based in Swanbourne in Western Australia. Three were from the 5th Aviation Regiment, which is based in Townsville. Hence, communities from one coast of the continent right through to the other have been affected. The men came from Western Australia, Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. With an average age of nearly 30, they were skilled and at the height of their competence. Selected to perform most difficult tasks under most difficult conditions, they trained rigorously and carefully to give us an important military capability. They were well prepared, but their work inevitably carried great risk. This risk they accepted in order to serve Australia and to protect all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many members of the House may have heard or read the words of Captain Burke, the pilot of the second helicopter in the crash. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been a real tragedy and we are all deeply hurt by it but what we've been doing we strongly believe in and we do it for the benefit of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>All Australians will be touched deeply by those sentiments. We can be immensely proud in this increasingly cynical age that our servicemen are so committed thus to serve their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our Defence Force has responded to adversity in a way that does it immense credit. Those immediately at the accident site itself acted with courage and discipline. Since then the army and other services have moved warmly to embrace and support the bereaved. I can promise the House that the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) and the government as a whole will ensure that everything that can be done is done to extend comfort and support in these sad circumstances to the injured and to the families of those who died.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I interpolate the written text to thank the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bishop) for what they did immediately after the accident in going to Townsville and representing directly on my behalf, and on behalf of the rest of the House, I am sure, the concerns and the expressions of support from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A memorial service was held in Townsville last Friday. A national memorial service was held in Canberra earlier today and was attended by many members of the House. It was a very moving, dignified service. Tomorrow there will be a service held in St Mary's Cathedral in Perth which I, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot), the Minister for Defence, the Minster for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel and the Governor-General, amongst many others, will be attending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Mr Speaker, on the night before the terrible accident at Townsville, you and I, and many others, shared the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Royal Australian Air Force. It was an opportunity for us to express our solidarity with and our celebration of the achievement of that wing of our defence forces. I and, I know, everybody else were tremendously impressed with the dignity, the bearing, the good grace and the good disposition of the men and women of the Royal Australian Air Force. It was a sheer delight and privilege to share that occasion with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within 24 hours, the whole nation feels a sense of great sadness and a great solidarity with the people who have been killed, with their relatives, their friends and their loved ones. It is an event that has shaken many people. The great strength that these wonderful men have displayed in such adversity is a tremendous inspiration and a reminder that the old&hyphen;fashioned commodity of personal courage, dignity and strength in a time of bereavement and sadness is a very important component of national life. They have done us great pride. They are an ornament to the Australian Defence Force, and the Defence Force itself is an ornament to this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the government and, I know, on behalf of the opposition, I want to say that the defence forces of this country will always <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1928"> have a special place in the affections and concerns of people who have responsibility in government. They are a wonderful body of men and women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will investigate the circumstances of the accident carefully. An investigation team was on site immediately, and a formal board of inquiry has been convened. Yet, even while this is done, the Defence Force will continue with its training program in order to maintain its capability to deal with the unpredictable and terrible threat that terrorism poses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, on behalf of the government, and I am sure with the support of all members of this House, I wish to honour the men who died in this accident; to give thanks for those that survived it; to commend the service men and women who responded so courageously at the site of the crash recovering the dead and rescuing the injured; and to record the supportive and professional assistance rendered by the local Townsville community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, I want to interpolate my thanks to the newly elected member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who contacted me on the night of the accident. In fact, it was his message to me at the Lodge when I was dining with the Premiers that gave me the first news of this tragedy. I know how tremendously supportive the member for Herbert has been to the local community and how he has, as one would expect, discharged to the full his responsibilities as a representative of that community&mdash;and, of course, the army personnel are very much of the heart and soul of the Townsville community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, Mr Speaker, we wish to share in the sorrow of families, friends and communities in Townsville and Perth. We express our deepest and heartfelt sympathy to all of them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and those that will subsequently be made by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) in offering the condolences of the opposition parties to those who have lost loved ones in last week's accident&mdash;their families, their wider family in the Special Air Services <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Regiment and the 5th Aviation Regiment, the army, the Chief of the General Staff, the Chief of the Defence Force and the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is always about our defence forces something of a cloister. They do gather together to share conjointly the tragedies that from time to time beset them. Nothing happens in one branch of the service that is not felt deeply elsewhere&mdash;as I had occasion to know, as I had the privilege to visit Swanbourne barracks on Thursday morning to talk with the chaplains and the troops who had been all night counselling the families of the dead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an enormous reserve of courage in our defence forces&mdash;moral courage as well as physical courage. To be able to deal with these sorts of problems when they occur requires people to draw on their resources of moral and physical courage. That was in ample display to me last Thursday morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very lucky in our service personnel. The average age will surprise people, I think. As has been said and as the Prime Minister has revealed, the average age is about 30. That is because we could have not got in the two branches of the army a more intensively selected group of men, both in the 5th Aviation Regiment and in the SASR. The refining fire they have to go through to achieve the positions they do is beyond the comprehension of any but a few members of this parliament, some of whom have been through it themselves at least to a small degree. It is beyond the comprehension of most, and it does not come at a young age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of that, instead of&mdash;as often is the case after defence accidents&mdash;our consoling mums and dads and sisters and brothers, now we are consoling whole families because a tragically high proportion of them were married and have left bereaved large numbers of women and children. One, indeed, had five, and it has been more than something of a shock to confront those&mdash;although I have not met them yet&mdash;or speak with those who have been dealing with that large bereaved family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Service in the SAS in particular is dangerous. Something like 17 soldiers have been lost in training since the formation of the unit in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1929"> 1957&mdash;nine in conflict, 17 in training. The training that they do has to be realistic. The training that they undertook in this particular exercise probably means more to us in this House than does just about any other form of training the defence forces undertake. This was counter&hyphen;terrorist activity. There is no doubt at all that individual members of this House and collectively members of this House rate high on the list of potential targets that these units train to rescue, should the politics of our nation become as benighted as those of a large number of other nations. They, of course, train not only to assist us but also to assist the community generally who may be victims of terrorist activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a highly honed unit at peak readiness, training constantly on the edge in order to be able to sustain that capability. It is not a capability that anyone can walk into overnight, even somebody who has been trained in that capability. It is one where you are only as good as your last training exercise and only as good as the realism of it. The realism of this exercise has obviously produced a set of circumstances of great tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No unit in war would expect to suffer these levels of casualty. This is an extraordinary proportion of the unit, an extraordinarily high percentage of the counter&hyphen;terrorist capability. It will take the SAS years and the 5th Aviation Regiment some time to actually make up the consequences of this loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The folk who participate in these organisations, as I said before, are so highly selected that you cannot immediately walk out and select another 18 to replace them. Life is not like that; it will not work like that. That is going to be a real problem for the armed services and for the SAS and the 5th Aviation Regiment in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Western Australian, this has very particular meaning to me and I am sure to all other Western Australian members of this parliament. The unit is stationed in the seat of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the personnel there are now part of Western Australia. Western Australia loves the SAS and it is deeply integrated into the Western Australian community. It is the one large regular army unit stationed in Western <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia. Their loss is a loss for the whole state and the whole state feels for them. The Prime Minister expressed some very fine sentiments and I agree with all of them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.46 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in expressing my great sorrow at the death of 18 fine Australians. They were great Australians who were serving in the Special Air Service Regiment and the 5th Aviation Regiment. The death of these soldiers has affected all Australians, none more so than those serving in the defence forces, particularly the army and those who have previously served in the army.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Soldiers and old soldiers know that training has to be realistic, as the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister have pointed out. There is no unit which undergoes more realistic training than the Special Air Service Regiment. The more realistic the training, the better equipped will our soldiers be for any future war or for any future civil emergency circumstance which can and does involve the SAS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with great sadness that I stand here today in memory of the 18 soldiers who were killed in training as a result of this horrific accident. I know all colleagues on both sides of the House share my concern and want to express sympathy through their leaders in relation to this. I also acknowledge that the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) and Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) travelled to Townsville. The Minister for Defence has asked that I particularly record that the shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), also travelled to Townsville to participate in providing assistance in the very extraordinary circumstances which arose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have complete faith that the investigations will be carried out fully and that the defence forces will seek to ensure that the matters are examined in absolute detail to ascertain what really happened and what steps must be taken with regard to ensuring that these accidents can be minimised and not happen at all. I spare thought and prayers for the families and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1930"> loved ones of those who were killed and also those 10 people who were injured, many of whom are still in hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as all thinking Australians are grateful for those who volunteer for service in the defence forces, so we are cut to the soul when as a result of training these volunteers are killed. Those families who are left behind have a right to be proud of their sons, their husbands, their fathers and their mates. I know that this is little compensation for the hollowness that is left behind, the great sense of loss of a son, the loss of a husband, the loss of a father and the loss of a mate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The individuals of the army, navy, air force and the armed forces generally are of necessity case hardened by their training and by the whole raft of activities associated with their military service for Australia in peacetime as well as wartime, but they are also human beings. As the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel pointed out this morning after the service, they bleed and are cut to the quick when these horrific accidents happen. They show it in their own ways. They maintain their esprit de corps, their sense of duty and the need for life to go on in the military circumstance. I know that at this time so many of them are hurt very badly and I extend empathy to all of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have written to the commanding officers of the SAS and the 5th Aviation Regiment. Of course those words are inadequate, but on behalf of the National Party, and indeed on behalf of all my colleagues who would want to speak on this matter, I express sympathy and condolences to all those affected by this calamitous accident.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 95th Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Union Conference held in Istanbul, April 1996. At the outset, I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for his agreement that I lead this particular delegation to the IPU conference. As he was aware, I was in the position of  being between and betwixt, being a shadow minister and being the deemed Speaker. I was still in that capacity, therefore, as the Chair of the Australian National Group of the IPU. Again, I thank him most sincerely for giving me the opportunity to say goodbye to some cherished friends in that organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very useful conference, as they seem to be, Mr Speaker, as I hope you will find in the future. I was accompanied on this particular occasion by the honourable members for Groom (Mr Taylor), Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) and Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and by Senator Wheelwright. We were ably looked after by Peter Keele, the secretary, and by Pam McDonald from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Three major items were discussed during this conference&mdash;the protection of minorities, the fight against terrorism and the protection of world fish stocks&mdash;as well as a whole range of other matters. The importance of a conference of this nature is that it allows the opportunity to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> network with members of parliaments from right around the world so that your ideas on democracy, your ideas on how you do things in your own country can be transmitted. At least you get an opportunity to talk with people about those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the highlights for the Australian group was a speech given by Senator Wheelwright in the course of the general debate. He chose to give a summation of Australia's attitude to French nuclear testing. During his contribution the French delegation continued to interject by turning their microphones on and screaming out, `Non, non; it is untrue,' and so on. Senator Wheelwright was undeterred and continued to give a great summation of this country's attitude to that particular matter. Might I say that, at the conclusion of his speech, he was given a standing ovation by the delegations that were present&mdash;and that was almost all of them&mdash;as he returned to his seat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last three years that I have been involved with the Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Union, it has provided me, on behalf of the Australian national parliament, with a chance to represent all the interests of honourable members here. I hope that I have done so to the best of my ability and in a way which has brought credit to this parliament. Mr Speaker, as you now take over that particular position as the Chair of the Australian National Group, I say to you in all sincerity that this organisation can do some good work. It is in need of some change. I do not think the members that have been to it before would disagree with that. I think the financial circumstances of the union need to be examined. Perhaps one option should be that instead of holding the conference twice a year it be held once a year. Perhaps there should be a review of the mechanism by which items are considered on the agenda for debate. Nevertheless, all of the delegates from Australia on this particular occasion&mdash;as they have during the past three years&mdash;played a champion role in advancing Australia's interest and the parliament's interest at the IPU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1932"> I want to thank my fellow delegates. They had the opportunity whilst we were there to pay a visit to Gallipoli and to pay the Austral ian parliament's respects to the war dead of Australia and, of course, the other countries represented in the graves at that particular location. I had been there some 12 months earlier and did not accompany my colleagues on this particular occasion. Nevertheless, I think the manner in which our colleagues worked well together on this occasion, the way in which they were prepared to debate the issues and the manner in which they continue to bring credit not only on the Australian parliament but also on themselves are reasons why this particular delegation should continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a plea, though, and it is one which, regrettably, on a couple of occasions I was not able to sustain: that is, as an Australian parliament we should always seek to have as the minimum one representative in the Australian parliamentary delegation from the female members of this place. I know that in the past the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) has done an exemplary job on behalf of the Australian parliament at the women parliamentarians' segment of the IPU conference, and I would like to thank her for that. Her involvement started well before the Canberra conference in September 1993 but certainly blossomed after that when she chaired the women's parliamentary conference here and continued to play an active role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IPU can do some good work. I think there is a need to ensure that it keeps on the straight and narrow path. Mr Speaker, I am sure that under your capable guidance in the Australian parliament it will do just that.</PARA></SPEECH>

First of all, I thank my parliamentary colleagues on this delegation: the honourable members for Cunningham (Mr Martin), Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) and Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and Senator Wheelwright. I also thank Peter Keele, the secretary of the delegation, without whose assistance we would not have got the job done nor would this delegation report have been produced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to thank Pam McDonald from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It has been my pleasure to be with Pam on a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> number of occasions overseas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the delegation, I would also like to thank our ambassador in Turkey, David Evans.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also thank the Turkish parliament&mdash;in particular the President of the Turkish National General Assembly&mdash;and the Turkish people. They made us very welcome and provided the facilities that enabled us to debate some of the issues on the floor of the plenary and in some of the committees that were set up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a pleasure to be with the honourable member for Cunningham on a number of overseas visits. He brings great credit to the office of the Speaker&mdash;he was Speaker at that time&mdash;and he has brought great credit on himself personally in leading a number of delegations over the last three years or so. On behalf of everybody in the delegation, we wish the member for Cunningham continuing success in whatever facility he might see his way clear to indulge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of supplementary items were discussed at the conference. As the honourable member for Cunningham has indicated, the item that was decided upon was terrorism, but a very important supplementary item which was debated as to whether it should go on the agenda was the ban on antipersonnel mines. Regrettably, we failed by a very narrow margin to get that up in the plenary. Understandably, after what went on in Lebanon in some of the refugee camps, it was not surprising that the item on terrorism got up and was debated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the very few minutes that I have got left, I would like to read part of what I said about that. I think it is very appropriate&mdash;bearing in mind the tragedy in North Queensland last Wednesday night in terms of anti&hyphen;terrorism <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1933"> measures&mdash;that we should consider one or two points in relation to Australia's attitude to terrorism. In part, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth of Australia deplores and condemns terrorism in all its forms and rejects in the strongest terms those who seek to legitimise any right to resort to terrorism for political objectives. Terrorism has no role in the democratic political processes. The gun and the bomb are no substitutes for objective dialogue and decision making within and between sovereign nation states. Australia will continue to support concerted international cooperative action to combat such tragic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not Australia's wish to single out countries or organisations which flout democratic rights and which resort to violent means. They stand vividly and publicly condemned almost daily on television screens right across the globe. Australia is sick to the stomach of the gory imagery of televised terrorism, of claim and of counterclaim. Australia wants it stopped.</PARA>
<PARA>It was a pleasure to be part of this delegation, and I congratulate everybody concerned on what I think was a most successful trip.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Sri Lanka from 3 to 6 October 1995 and the report of the Commonwealth of Australia branch delegation to the 41st Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference held in Colombo, Sri Lanka in October 1995. The delegation's official visit to Sri Lanka was a very short one&mdash;only four days&mdash;before attending the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference held in Colombo. Even though we had only such a short time, we were able to see a surprising amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The delegation members for the visit were Mr Jim Snow, the former member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro, as leader; me, the member for Moncrieff, as deputy leader; Senator Nick Minchin; and Senator Christabel Chamarette. The CPA conference delegation was led by Senator Gerry Jones, who is a regional representative of the CPA for the Australian region.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit to Sri Lanka took place from 3 to 6 October last year and was the first visit there since 1986. At the time of the visit there had been considerable change in Sri Lanka and hope for a resolution to the long&hyphen;running conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and militant Tamil groups, most prominently the LTTE. Even though we only had four days, we were able to talk to a wide range of people about the prospects for an end to the war and about trade and investment matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We met with a number of ministers, including the Prime Minister, Mrs Bandaranaike, who became the first woman Prime Minister in the world in 1960. She has since had two more periods as Prime Minister and has played a major role in Sri Lankan politics and government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all the meetings we had with both ministers and opposition party leaders, a genuine commitment to achieving peace was evident. It is very disappointing that hostilities have since been renewed. A solution must be found soon if Sri Lanka is to continue to attract foreign investment and trade and halt the devastating cost of the war&mdash;not only economic but also in lives and social and political upheaval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A highlight of the trip was the opportunity to visit some of the projects being undertaken with Australian aid funding. These were all in rural areas, and in each case we were overwhelmed by the generosity and enthusiasm of the local people who performed traditional dances in our honour and plied us with refreshments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was at one of these projects, located not far from the Tamil held areas, that we were reminded of the realities of the war. We were escorted by an extremely large contingent of armed police&mdash;a disturbing experience for Australians&mdash;but this did not dampen the enthusiasm of the locals who were eager to show us the work they had carried out with their own hands and Australian money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia and Sri Lanka have enjoyed a long and warm bilateral relationship based on strong Commonwealth links, wartime links and a flow of Sri Lankan migrants to Australia. Trade and investment have been an important part of the relationship. We saw a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1934"> number of opportunities for Australian investment in Sri Lanka and were able to discuss several existing projects. Despite the brief duration of the visit, we were able to see and talk to a number of people and see for ourselves the need for infrastructure development to support any growth in trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to record the delegation's thanks to everyone who met with us. At all meetings and inspections the delegation heard the frank views of the people they met and received warm hospitality. Thanks are also due to the Australian High Commissioner, Mr Bill Tweddell, and his staff, particularly Mr Dominic Trindade who organised the itinerary and accompanied the delegation throughout. The assistance and support provided by the High Commissioner and his staff were first class. The Sri Lankan High Commissioner here in Canberra also provided invaluable assistance and generous hospitality&mdash;both prior to our visit and after our return&mdash;which was much appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immediately following the official visit, the delegation attended the 41st Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference, held in Colombo. The conference was attended by approximately 250 delegates from more than 100 Commonwealth countries. Senator Gerry Jones led the delegation and also attended the Executive Committee meeting which took place immediately prior to the conference. Representatives from all Australian states and territories also attended the conference so that together we made a substantial Australian contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The theme of the conference was `Democracy and development: Adversaries or allies?' In line with the practice developed since 1992, the emphasis was on panel sessions where more informal discussions took place. Jim Snow was invited to be a panel member at one of the sessions and other delegates were able to make contributions, both in the panel sessions and at the conference plenary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, addressed the conference on the challenges and opportunities facing the Commonwealth at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting which was due to take place in Auckland shortly after this conference. He focused, in particu lar, on ways in which the Commonwealth can achieve practical results in fulfilling the principles in the Harare Commonwealth Declaration, especially in upholding democratic values within its own countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The General Assembly of the CPA met at the beginning of the conference and agreed to the formation of branches in seven South African provinces. Representatives of those branches attended the conference and were welcomed by delegates. The conference does not have the power to pass resolutions or agree to communiques expressing a particular position. At this conference, however, Senator Gerry Jones and the Hon. Ngereteina Puna of the Cook Islands were instrumental in the preparation of a petition expressing concern about the testing of nuclear weapons by France and China. The petition endorsed a declaration made by the Australian Pacific regional conference of the CPA earlier in the year and called on France to sign and ratify the protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. The petition was signed by more than 100 delegates at the conference. The Commonwealth Secretary-General agreed to convey it to Auckland for the attention of the Commonwealth Heads of Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians Group conducted its seventh meeting in conjunction with the conference and for the first time no other conference events were scheduled at the time of the meeting. This meant that Senator Jones and other members of the CPA executive committee could attend and lend support to the group. Mr Deputy Speaker, could I be supplied with a clock, please? I have no idea how much time I have left.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The conference proceeded without a hitch, despite the uncertainties presented by the continuing conflict in Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Branch and its secretariat are to be congratulated on their achievement. There is one person I have so far omitted to thank, probably because she essentially wrote the script for my speech, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1935"> that is Robin Weber, who was secretary to the delegation, both on the visit and at the conference. On behalf of all members of the delegation I would like to pay tribute to her for her hard work and unfailing assistance in all details. We were also briefed by the Library and by Foreign Affairs before leaving and I thank them for their major contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make two other comments. One is in relation to the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians Group. We have just had a report from an IPU delegation where reference was made to the meeting of women parliamentarians at the IPU. I am aware that the meeting of the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians Group grew out of the experience of women from Commonwealth countries attending Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Union conferences and having experience of that group. I am sure that male parliamentarians wonder why it is necessary. It is simply this: without women meeting together to make their input in a particular way it has been the experience of these conferences in the past that certain items simply are never raised for the agenda. There are certain items that for some reason or another are of more concern to women. They are a concern, of course, to the human race and the joining together of women parliamentarians in a mutually supportive way has contributed a great deal to discussions at conferences both of the CPA and the IPU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other comment I would like to make that I think is of particular significance to CPA conferences. This was the first one I had attended. The big difference between CPA and IPU conferences is the participation of Pacific delegates. The IPU is basically too expensive for Pacific countries to belong to apart from countries such as Australia and New Zealand. So the Pacific voice is rarely heard there, except when it is expressed by Australian and New Zealand delegates. I would, therefore, particularly welcome the fact that the CPA conference gave those small Pacific nations the opportunity to participate fully. I believe that was reflected in the high priority that was given to the issue of the nuclear tests in the Pacific by France. I commend the reports to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has been stung by the introduction of the Trade Practices Amendment (Better Business Conduct) Bill sufficiently to put to a committee's examination the harsh and unconscionable conduct by large business against smaller enterprise. The committee represents evasion. It is an opportunity to go around the garden yet again on an issue which has been done to death in debate on the Trade Practices Act. It is a matter on which small business and their organisations have detailed, longstanding positions. The government's intention is for a committee's deliberation, followed by a further consultation, followed no doubt by an election and we start all over again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They made amply clear in opposition that they did not want to support small business on this issue. Here is their chance again. We will take responsibility for the legislation. We will do the job they squib. They can let the legislation through on the nod, therefore not earning the hostility of their friends in big business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business do not dance to the Liberal ideology. They are heartily tired of hearing their mantra about red tape. They have noted the minister's backing away from his commitment to a 50 per cent reduction of red tape in the life of this parliament. They are not a bit surprised. Cutting red tape is much more a local and state government problem than it is a federal one. The federal government is in charge of the Trade Practices Act and here they should expect action from the national parliament. The government well knows that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1936"> this is the issue that small business identifies as its No. 1 priority and that there is daylight between this and all the other issues that the government wants small business to be interested in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill I present today modestly and carefully deals with this problem of harsh and oppressive conduct. The bill is not a substitute for sound judgment and the need to address commercial reality by business people. It does not protect business from bad judgment or the consequences of shifts in the economy. Nor does it undermine the privacy of contract. It does not prohibit harsh outcomes. Agreements freely entered into and consequent of full disclosure must stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill deals with pre&hyphen;existing relationships. The reason for this limitation is that, however painful the decisions, businesses that have no sunk costs in a commercial relationship can walk away if the terms and conditions are not commensurate with the returns. It is about commercial relationships that are of major significance to one of the parties to the relationship. It is not a bill to provide relief from every activity that is irksome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill prohibits exploitation of a party denied commercial choices by virtue of the particular relationship they have with another firm. It is confined to the exploitation of that particular relationship. A company that chooses to engage in a common set of conduct across all commercial relationships is not exploiting any one particular arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In markets where competition is reduced, the existing provisions of the Trade Practices Act governing the misuse of market power prevent the exploitation of firms. This bill addresses discriminatory conduct where a company exploits a particular relationship to seek extra market rents unsustainable in the open market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It encourages good voluntary codes. Many landlords have adopted practices that recognise their mutually dependent relationship with tenants. Recently, the Builders Owners and Managers Association and the Retailers Council of Australia have started to encourage better business conduct between the parties they represent. This bill supports these changes in leasing practices by capturing those <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> firms that refuse to comply with the industry developed norms of behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, with the other provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974, provides a legislative safety net for industry codes of practice, reducing the level of regulation that would otherwise be necessary for many industry sectors. By testing adherence to self&hyphen;regulatory codes as a factor which a court may have regard to in determining whether conduct is harsh or oppressive, the bill explicitly recognises the important role that these codes play in establishing acceptable standards of business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the bill is about changing the way firms interact so that those with significant interdependence cannot ignore the impact of their decision on those bound to them. Small business enjoyed a massive expansion whilst we were in office. Seventy per cent of our record job growth occurred in small business. Recently, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been prepared to admit that he came into office with the economy in a sound condition. It is so because we were prepared to be responsive to the needs of business within the framework of a wider protection of public interest. Our experience and, more importantly, the experience of small business determined that this bill presents a course that must be followed. Stop the evasion now. Bring the bill on for full debate. Pass the bill. I seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> expresses concern that the increasing numbers of ageing parents who are sole carers of adult children with disabilities, including physical, intellectual, psychiatric and sensory disabilities, and those with acquired brain injury <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1937"> should have better access to respite and permanent residential or in&hyphen;house care services for their dependants;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> calls upon the governments involved to urgently implement an appropriate action plan following these negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA>Soon after I became the member for Murray, a number of elderly people began to present themselves to my office. I presumed that they were bringing to me their concerns about their own futures as elderly, frail people with limited incomes, mostly dependent on some social security payment. Rather, their concerns were wrapped around the fact that they were carers of disabled adult sons and daughters and, in some cases, grandchildren.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As their own lives advanced, they were becoming less able to keep up the very difficult job of 24&hyphen;hour care for the disabled members of their family. They were becoming increasingly concerned that there were not the services available in the community to support them, to give them ease of mind that, if they should pass away, their sons and daughters would have some accommodation with the level of support that they had been able to give as parents. They were concerned that they would not be able to find respite care. As you can imagine, if you are in your seventies or eighties, giving 24&hyphen;hour care gets too much from time to time and you need to have time away, perhaps to meet with other members of the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too often, in my own electorate, the only place to put these adult sons and daughters with intellectual and/or physical handicaps is in acute beds in hospitals so that their carers can have some time out. That is obviously not what acute beds are intended for and it is not a cost&hyphen;effective way to go about giving respite care, but it is the only option for too many people who find themselves in this very difficult situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have a wheelchair you obviously need special transportation. If you are living in the country often the payments available now are not sufficient to get your son or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> daughter to therapy sessions or to meet with others. These people are often aware that there are services somewhere else, but they cannot access them because of transport costs or the difficulty of transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very often ageing parents have limited knowledge of what is available or they are confused by the complexities of the state or Commonwealth programs offered. For example, if you are born disabled and are registered soon after birth with that particular disability, a range of services and facilities flow in your direction. If you become disabled later in life&mdash;for example, you acquire a brain injury&mdash;a different set of circumstances go into motion. It is more difficult to access those same services if you acquired the injury later in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just my Murray electorate that has 40 or more people in their seventies and eighties taking care of substantially disabled sons and daughters. And can I mention a grandparent who is looking after his teenage daughter with muscular dystrophy. He himself is in his eighties. His wife died recently. You can imagine the extraordinary anxiety he now feels for the welfare of his granddaughter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the most recent Australian Bureau of Census and Statistics figures tell us that there are more than 7,500 carers in this category. We can expect over time that substantially more people will enter this type of family care. We know that more people survive brain injury as adults and more people born with disabilities survive to live long lives and, we hope, lives which are meaningful for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, families are often smaller than they were before. Family networks are less prevalent in our society. Families are more mobile. Too many of our families are broken up with husbands and wives going in different directions. So, in the future, we cannot imagine that we will be able to depend on this pool of caring parents who will pick up the burdens of a disabled son or daughter and carry that burden for perhaps 30, 40 or more years of the life of their sons and daughters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying that the previous government ignored this problem. In 1991 the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1938"> Commonwealth and state disability agreement looked very carefully at how the responsibilities and tasks of caring for the disabled should be divided between the states and Commonwealth. That three&hyphen;year agreement is to be renegotiated this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the early assessment of how that agreement delivered services to this disabled area, we have to be substantially concerned. What has been found in this early assessment&mdash;and what my older parents are saying to me&mdash;is that the agreement has, very largely, failed to deliver its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have cases where there is incredible bureaucracy, inflexibility of program delivery and problems in defining or attempting to define categories of disability, which make it a nightmare to try to work your way through if you have a son or daughter with a multiple set of disabilities. Too often if you have shared Commonwealth and state funding there is a tendency for one or the other to try to move the disabled into another category where the funds will not be drawn from your particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As COAG moves into the scene, there has also been an endeavour to try to deliver the services within a market model. We must always ensure that economic efficiencies are achieved within a most humane set of understandings about the needs of the disabled. But there is a real fear&mdash;certainly in the last three years&mdash;that the disabled and their carers have not been served well by the CSDA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In bringing this matter before the House, I ask that we call on the negotiators, who will meet at the time of the mid-year review of the three&hyphen;year Commonwealth&hyphen;state disability agreement, to give very particular attention to the level of service now provided to the disabled and to their needs and to their carers. I call upon the governments involved to very urgently implement an appropriate action plan following these negotiations. There are too many disabled individuals who are not receiving the attention our society should be giving them and their carers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I share the concern of the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) for the increasing numbers of ageing parents who are carers, especially sole carers, of adult children with disabilities, I do think from a policy point of view it is wrong to focus only on the needs of one particular group in a way that could lead to artificial distortions in our response to a larger area of need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just by way of example, this weekend coming the Carers Association of Australia is conducting a nationwide phone survey in an effort to establish the number of children who are carers in Australia. I recommend to all members of the House that they assist with this phone&hyphen;in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that governments in Australia must be prepared to face up to and deal with the many challenges that come with an ageing population. This needs to be done in a systematic and organised way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proportion of the population over 65 is predicted to double over the next 60 years&mdash;a rise from 11 per cent to 22 per cent of our population. These figures come from a paper which I would also recommend to all those members of the House who are concerned about this issue of carers&mdash;an excellent paper prepared by Mary Lindsay called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who cares for the carers?</EMPHASIS> I think it summarises very well all the issues which are relevant to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major statistic&mdash;and I will stop with the statistics after this one&mdash;is the rise in those over 80 years of age, which will be even more marked than the general ageing of the population. We will go from two per cent of the population over the age of 80 to eight per cent in the next 60 years. It is the case that the older a person becomes the more likely they will require an increasing amount of care and the more likely that they themselves will be disabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion before the House draws attention to the plight of ageing parents caring&mdash;often on their own&mdash;for disabled adult children. There is no doubt that these people are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1939"> a group in the community for whom it is impossible to express too much admiration. The obligation is now on governments to support these people in the same unselfish way in which they have supported their own families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud of Labor's record in tackling the needs of older and disabled Australians. Labor governments in recent years have shown an increased awareness of these needs in three different sorts of ways: firstly, by providing publicly funded services; secondly, by increasing the payment of allowances to carers; and, thirdly and very importantly, by working out changes that enable carers to combine their responsibilities in the paid work force with their responsibilities as carers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the motion before us says, one of the most important areas of assistance that is offered to anyone caring for an aged or disabled person is respite care. Many people do not want to give up their caring role even when increasing age makes this more difficult. This is where respite care can bridge the gap and enable people to care for their loved ones in their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Respite care has been identified by carers as the most important service provided to them. The 1992-93 budget increased the number of days of respite care available in nursing homes and hostels from 28 to 63 per year. The Labor government also encouraged nursing homes to provide additional respite beds through a respite care supplement introduced in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a further attempt to ease the shortage of respite beds in nursing homes, the following year's budget announced an allocation of $9.2 million for respite care. It also changed the rules to allow nursing homes to use existing, as opposed to dedicated, beds for respite as they became available. As a consequence, respite admissions to nursing homes have increased steadily and the ratio of respite beds has also increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The home and community care program also provides respite care for shorter periods and in emergencies in community centres and at home. Respite care has been one of the fastest growing elements of the home and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community care program. In addition to the funding provided jointly by the Commonwealth and the states to carers through the home and community care program, the Labor government in the 1992-93 budget allocated an additional $40 million over four years for respite services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt whatsoever that this funding needs to be continued. Unfortunately, we are yet to get any guarantees from this current government that there will not be cuts to the home and community care program. I urge the member for Murray and all those opposite who do care about this issue to apply as much pressure as possible in the current budget process to make sure that this area of the home and community care program is protected so that carers have the support that they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important reform which Labor instituted was a review of respite care programs. This began in 1995 `to look at the cost-effectiveness and appropriateness of respite care program services delivered through aged and community care programs'&mdash;I am now reading the terms of reference&mdash;`and to improve the coherence of respite care programs in order to achieve better outcomes for carers and the people they care for'. I am sure we all look forward to receiving that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt about the seriousness of Labor's commitment to the ongoing welfare of older and disabled Australians. The real question now is: what is this government going to do to continue that commitment? Of particular concern to older Australians, especially those who may be caring for an older or disabled relation at home, is the handing back of aged care services to the states. And, as the member for Murray said, we are yet to hear what will happen to disability services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal for aged care is part of what the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) calls competitive federalism. The most recently enunciated elements of this government's federalism received a unanimous thumbs down at last week's Premiers Conference by the various representatives of the providers of services and care to older Australians and those with disabilities. They <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1940"> have expressed their deep concern about the direction of this government's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can just read a couple of comments from the Reverend Harry Herbert, Secretary of the Uniting Church Board of Social Responsibility, he said last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has already announced that some parts of community services aged care, for example&mdash;are going to be transferred to the State governments. We're very concerned about that. We're concerned about the conditions under which that will apply, what sort of principles will be put in place. We don't want community services to be a trade-off for some other deal between the Federal and State governments.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .. the State governments, as we know over the row about sales tax, are at the mercy of the Federal Government in regard to resources.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .. the States will be starved of resources and won't be able to provide adequate community services.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .. at the moment in Australia, we have a reasonable system of aged care. There are some problems . . . but at least, wherever you live in Australia . . . you are entitled to more or less the same treatment in regard to aged care. Your access to nursing homes . . . is more or less the same, but if this is all transferred to State governments, will we go back to the bad old days where the service you get will depend upon what part of Australia you live in?</PARA>
<PARA>This applies to respite care as well. Once these services are handed back to the states, there is no way that we can guarantee that we will not face the same sorts of problems that the member for Murray described&mdash;I think, rightly&mdash;in disability services. That is why all these organisations that support the Reverend Herbert's comments are adamantly opposed to the transfer of aged care services and related disability services to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is showing that it wants to wash its hands of its responsibility to older and disabled Australians. I think it is terribly important that we do not allow this to happen. I support the motion before the House, but I strongly urge those opposite to work against the transfer of these responsibilities to the states.  </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I assure the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) that I will be taking a bipartisan approach to this issue. I hope she will support the motion. The issues raised in this motion are critical. Too often as a community we take the attitude that if a problem is out of mind it is out of sight. I believe that this may have been the problem that has afflicted the physical, intellectual, psychiatric and sensory disabled and their carers for far too long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It becomes a community issue and one that government must address when you hear and read of elderly parents who are caring for their children saying that they pray that their children will die before they do because they fear for their children's welfare without them to look after them. Whilst not an elderly carer, I understand their concern. I was one of the fortunate ones. When my eldest daughter was aged two, she spent almost four years in hospital with a disability disease that somehow miraculously corrected itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this was at what expense? The guilt over my not being able to be at home to care for the rest of the family, and the financial pressure and the lack of understanding from the community and the rest of the family. This is only minor compared with what parents of those with serious disabilities are faced with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia alone the Disabilities Council estimates that 13,000 people have a developmental disability and that most live at home. Mr Kevin Stone of the Victorian Advocacy League for Individuals says that many of these people can live at home as long as their carers have some sort of relief that can be provided by respite care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no denying that the carers&mdash;and many are probably unaware of this&mdash;are providing the sort of care that, if it had to be provided by professionals, is saving extensive public expenditure. In many ways this represents what Peter Drucker is advocating: using public funds with private charities to provide better care for all involved. The problem is that we currently have the latter without the former.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion&mdash;and I commend the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) in bringing this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1941"> serious matter to the attention of the House&mdash;seeks to recognise that as a government we need to provide support for the carers and calls upon those who form the guidelines to bring forward policy that addresses what we are conveniently choosing to forget: that carers are also in need of care, attention and rest like most of us who do not have the extra burden of their loved ones being afflicted with these severe disabilities. The government and community need to assure the carers that when they have gone there will be care for those they have loved and looked after for so long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also refer to the research done by Mary Lindsay of Parliamentary Services titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who cares for the carers?</EMPHASIS> It is an excellent example of how funding should be apportioned. I call upon this government to review with sensitivity and understanding any further budgets in this area when it comes to addressing the $8 billion black hole and to remember just how much carers are already saving this country in costs associated in caring for those with severe disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It horrifies me to read that elderly parents have contemplated killing their children and then committing suicide because of their living on the edge of fear and uncertainty. It is a known fact that families go into automatic routine with no lives of their own because they have no options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently this government has given $24,800 to the Carers Association to examine the extent of social problems associated with young carers. We are also implementing respite for the carers program and the development of emergency respite care, together with the establishment of a carers resource centre. Today this government has announced a further $15,000 towards facilities for transport services in the Gilmore electorate for those with disabilities. However, much more needs to be done to recognise the needs of elderly carers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commend the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) for bringing this very important and very human problem to the attention of the House. I have held for a long time a deep concern for ageing parents <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who are the carers of their children with disabilities. I have worked in association with many groups in my electorate to have governments recognise the desperate situation that many of these people face in regard to the future care of their offspring and for the need to have appropriate services in place to assist in the long-term care of their children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been reported locally, and no doubt nationally, about the many cases of adults with an intellectual disability being left following the death of their carer, predominantly their parents. I have been told by many parents that they are too afraid to die because there is nowhere for their child to go. It is very difficult to expect family members to assume the role of carer when a parent dies, as in most cases they have not had to deal with the day to day care that has been given over many years by the parents. So what happens to these people? Most are removed from their familiar surroundings, usually away from their local area, and placed in some type of care with people unknown to them. This is an all too familiar occurrence and one which governments should be doing something about now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A group in the Illawarra I must pay tribute to is the Lobby Group for Aged Parents and Their Intellectually Disabled Adult Children and in particular to Margaret Chadwick and Jim Lyons, along with many others who formed the group in 1991. I also pay tribute to the Illawarra Disabled Persons Trust and the many other disability service providers in the Illawarra region. Over many years they have expressed concern about the critical lack of permanent accommodation for adults with an intellectual disability living with ageing parents and the lack of services available to meet their existing and future needs, particularly respite facilities. Time and again parents have revealed their anguish and anxiety for the future welfare of their adult children. They want to ensure that their children receive secure and supportive residential care when they are no longer able to be the carer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of these parents provide constant care for their sons and daughters from the time their children are born. They need to know that similar care will continue throughout <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1942"> their children's lives and they need to know that their children will be given every opportunity to gain as much independence as they can cope with. Their adult children need to continue their role as accepted and contributing members of the community whilst, at the same time, receiving all the care and guidance they require.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 a report was released into the needs of adults who have an intellectual disability and their ageing parents in the Wollongong area. This study was undertaken by the ACT Disability Aged and Carer Advocacy Service. Copies of this report were widely distributed as well as being distributed to all relevant state government agencies. The report was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I think about it all the time</EMPHASIS> and was compiled with the assistance of some 73 families in the Wollongong area who participated in the study. This study identified many issues concerning opportunities for a more dignified independent quality of life for people with a disability and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report highlighted over and over again the urgency of providing accommodation solutions for such families. It was emphasised that strategies need to be developed to address the urgent needs of families but, at the same time, put in place longer term solutions for families who have children with a disability who will require accommodation arrangements in the future. The demand for more residential respite accommodation and for longer periods of time was also highlighted many times in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As other speakers have said, most parents have had years of saving government money. Last year it was reported that parents who maintain at home their children with a disability save governments about $60,000 each year. How much then have parents saved governments when these parents have cared for these children over 20, 40 or even 50 years? After so long most parents feel that they should be able to retire and to have their children settled in suitable accommodation so that the transition from the home environment is done with a minimum of upset to their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The critical need for permanent care and accommodation for ageing disabled adults cannot be overemphasised and their plight <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cannot be ignored any longer. We must act now. I support the motion before the House and again commend the honourable member for bringing this motion on. It is a situation that is in urgent need of attention because these people have given tremendous service to the community and to their children.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my electorate of Maribyrnong there is a large parcel of land known as the Albion explosives land. As that name would obviously imply, the land was used for defence purposes for many decades, but in recent times it has been just a derelict eyesore. That land presents a whole range of development opportunities. There is very considerable private sector interest in housing development on that land. There is the opportunity for expansion of university facilities and also to resolve, by the freeing up of that land, some very longstanding traffic circulation difficulties in the St Albans district.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal problem is the assessment of decontamination works required on the land. The Department of Defence has had for some time a report on that land written by independent consultants. There seems to be some confusion about how that report is to be released to someone like me as the local member. Apparently the Public Works Committee was dealing with this matter in the previous parliament, but it has not yet been reconstituted and there are some questions about whether the documentation needs to go to that committee first.

Based on the British SAS, the Australian SAS was successful in combating the communist insurgency in Malaya, and this remains a rare example of guerilla warfare being defeated. Of 2,000 patrols during the Vietnam War, only two casualties were suffered. Today Australia's SAS is recognised as one of the best special forces in the world.

The scissors are removed, a suction tube is inserted and the child's brains are sucked out, causing the skull to collapse. The dead baby is then removed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and also thank him for the effort that he put in last week in Townsville. On that subject, could I just add a couple of words to what was said earlier. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1947"> Last Wednesday evening, as we all know, 18 young Australians were killed on duty in the service of Australia. They were from the highly trained counter&hyphen;terrorist squadron of the SAS and their job is to protect Australians from the threat of terrorism in situations that are beyond the capacity of the police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The procedures involved demand speed, precision, accuracy, skill, knowledge and, above all, courage. Those abilities can be gained only by those people practising in rigorous conditions and by realistic training. In other words, they train as hard as they have to fight&mdash;or harder. Tragically, their training last Wednesday took some of them, as the Leader of the Opposition said earlier, over the edge. The result was a tragic loss for families, friends and comrades, the ADF and the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Defence Force will do all that is possible to determine the cause of the tragedy and to take whatever action is necessary to reduce the possibility of further accidents while at the same time maintaining the skills that I described a minute ago. An accident investigation team was dispatched to Townsville within, I understand, five hours of the crash. It was certainly in place early the following morning. Its task is to investigate and report on the events which occurred at the high range training area, and an initial report will be provided to me as soon as practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An official board of inquiry has been convened today by the Chief of the General Staff to examine the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the accident. The terms of reference of the inquiry have been issued and the board is expected to bring down that report on 31 July. It will start work tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Defence Force has been, and will be, exemplary in its attention to the needs of the families, friends and comrades affected by this tragic accident. Arrangements have been put in place to support the next of kin through counselling teams and so on. In addition, the military compensation rehabilitation service will be assisting those injured and the dependants of those killed in the accident in relation to claims for benefits under the military compensation scheme, though no compensation could possibly be adequate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on my feet I would like to acknowledge and thank the shadow minister, the member for Brisbane, for his support to the ADF and to families and friends last week. He was in Townsville for the full two days and I know that they are extremely grateful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This accident is a tragedy for the ADF and for the families and friends of those involved. All Australians can be proud of the courage and compassion which those people have shown in the face of this adversity and of the determination they display in facing the task ahead.</PARA>

A figure of 68.7 per cent of home loan lending comes from those four major banks.

The benefits in relation to this are that the government sector will be on the same footing as the private sector.

I preface it by saying that I am sure the minister realises how important systems integration is to Australia, to Australian industry and Australian defence. I ask the minister: is it true that Telstra Applied Technology, a wholly owned subsidiary of Telstra, is planning to sell its systems integration capacity to Lockheed or to another company? Does the minister agree with this, and does he believe it will have any detrimental effect on Australia's defence as this is the only Australian company capable of substantial systems integration?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The short answer is that it is very important indeed. The $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust fund will be established to fund five key capital projects aimed at addressing the serious challenges facing this country in the area of environmental and agricultural natural resources. We are very keen to see it go ahead, as I believe all thinking Australians are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program constitutes national capital of vital importance. We propose to spend $700 million to fund five key capital programs over five years, leaving $300 million remaining in perpetuity in the trust. It is also proposed that the trust be funded from the part proceeds arising from the one-third sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The soon to be introduced Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill will provide for funds in trust to be invested and used in accordance <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the stated objectives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one doubts, I hope, the importance of the objectives. Any delays in the passage of the legislation&mdash;and this is an important point&mdash;will only lead to further environmental degradation and further environmental decline&mdash;decline which can and should be avoided.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you were to take a responsible lead, you could help prevent the further decline in environmental standards in this country. That is the issue. Any stalling tactics supported by the opposition or by minority parties in the other place will have a direct impact on Australia's environment and natural resources. That is the price we will pay for delay and obstruction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the stakes are very high for groups such as the Australian Democrats. We ought to go back to what Don Chipp said when he set up the party in the first place. Remember those famous words about keeping people honest. Let us put that in context. He uttered those words in response to concerns of the day that the government was not carrying out its pre-election promises. That is why he set his party up. His objective was to get the balance of power to ensure that the government of the day stuck to its election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that the Democrats have forgotten all about that and have moved away from that altogether. They are being deliberately obstructionist, using every opportunity to get in the way. If they were in any way fair dinkum about this issue, they would have referred the relevant bill to a legislation committee. But they have not done that. They have referred the bill to a references committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No longer do the Democrats represent the balance of power. It is quite obvious that they are rapidly becoming nothing more than a faction of the ALP. You really have to ask whether their agenda is focused on supporting <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1952"> good policies of government, because their record suggests that it is not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say at the outset that the federal government highlighted the problems about our coastlines both before and after the March election. Honourable members would be aware that some 86 per cent of Australians live along our coastline, and much of our commercial industrial activity takes place in those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise that Australians regard our coasts as being very special places which play an intrinsic part in our way of life, and indeed are national icons both domestically and overseas. Australians also know that our coasts have increasingly come under threat from human activity. In some ways our coasts have probably been loved to death. Pressures through poor management and development decisions and pollution from our sewerage and river systems have all contributed to coastal degradation. Governments, coastal communities and all Australians understand that we must improve the way we treat our coastlines. We require positive solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy of Senator Kernot is remarkable. At the end of May in the Senate she called for national leadership in relation to this issue. At the same time that she called on the government to show leadership and protect Australia's coasts and rivers, she is denying the funding for us to be able to do that.

The fact is that if we did not abolish this program we would otherwise have to reduce spending on humanitarian programs within the aid budget: cutting out programs to assist with HIV&hyphen;AIDS in Africa; cutting out humanitarian programs in countries like Bangladesh. We were not prepared to do that. If we had to make a reduction in the aid budget, we were prepared to do that in the area of business subsidies. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1957">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let it be said that, in light of the DIFF program, Transfield&mdash;which is a good company but is one of the richest companies in this country&mdash;has received $153.4 million in subsidies from the Australian government. For one of the richest companies in this country to get $153.4 million in subsidies from taxpayers I do not believe is good use of the aid budget. I happen to think that is not a good idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the comments that Mr Woolcott made as referred to in the question. Mr Woolcott is a very fine Australian, but he is a consultant to Transfield. The fact is that he does have a view to promote in the interests of this company. He does not hide that from me. I do not denigrate him, because he is a fine Australian&mdash;he has done a good job for this government and he has gone a great job for the previous government and for this country&mdash;but I think that needs to be understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that the Labor Party argued before the last election that there should be a $1 billion increase in spending on the aid budget but never explained where the money was coming from. We know what you were always planing to do&mdash;and that was to increase taxes. That is what you were planning to do. That was why the member for Gellibrand would never rule out increases in taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not think that is a digression because that is their real agenda. That is what they are about. You can bet your bottom dollar that the Labor Party&mdash;which reduced the aid budget throughout the life of its government over 13 years&mdash;in opposition is going to be talking about increasing the aid budget. That is what they will doing; that is the expediency of it. The subliminal message is that these people are about tax increases to fix this country's fiscal problems. It is as simple as that.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DK6">Mr HOCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I ask the minister: can you confirm that, rather than the spectacular success claimed by the Maritime Union of Australia, waterfront productivity has actually fallen at the P&amp;O ports CTAL terminal under the productivity employment proposal, or PEP scheme, as it is known?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1957" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members may recall that just after the election the Maritime Union of Australia announced that a deal had been struck with one of Australia's largest stevedores, Conaust&mdash;or CTAL as they are more commonly known&mdash;that would deliver for the Australian waterfront what had not been delivered for years and years, and that is an efficient, competitive and reliable Australian waterfront. That deal is now known as the PEP scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told that the PEP scheme would deliver productivity improvements and lower costs to the stevedoring company and, therefore, to its users. This sounded great. Those of us who had been following the waterfront for a long time had come to expect a lot of promise on the waterfront but not much delivery. This sounded new, it sounded different and it sounded encouraging. The joint Chief Secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia, Mr John Coombs, promised us that this would bring home the bacon for Australia; this would deliver the goods. We would have an efficient waterfront for Australia and for those people desperately seeking a competitive economy and, therefore, a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has actually happened? The scheme, rather prophetically, came into action on 1 April of this year. I say `rather prophetically' because that was April Fool's Day. What has been the result? Prior to the scheme coming into place average crane movements per hour at Conaust were 17. What is the figure today? <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1958"> Two and a half months after the scheme came into effect crane rates have fallen to 14.4 per hour in Sydney, for example. So, rather than crane rates and productivity going up, they have started to decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the truth about the lower costs we were promised by the scheme? Part of the deal was that overtime rates would be written into the normal base salary for those people working at Conaust on the Australian waterfront. This would therefore lift their pay to a much higher base. Members need to know that average earnings are about $80,000 a year. What was the outcome of this? Have labour costs gone down on the Australian waterfront? The answer is no. Conaust has experienced an increase in labour costs to its business of $100,000 a week on average since the scheme came into effect. So after 2&half; months of this great promise, rather than productivity going up, it has gone down and, rather than labour costs going down, they have gone up. This continues the performance that we came to expect under the previous Labor government, where we saw years of talk and very little action&mdash;action that unfortunately involved the expenditure of some $450 million to provide incentive for the waterfront workers to work more efficiently and reliably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This example shows us that we cannot rely on the Maritime Union of Australia to deliver on its promises. The only way Australians can expect to get a waterfront that is efficient and reliable and internationally competitive is to see the industrial relations legislation that was introduced by my colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations in this House pass through this parliament. If that is the case, then we will end up with an efficient, competitive and reliable Australian waterfront.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My speech today draws on the work of Kathy Brown's workshop paper `Towards a national agenda for carers', information from the Queensland Council on Intellectual <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Disability's unmet needs campaign, and Unicare. There are thousands of Australians with disabilities, together with their families and carers, who are living in the community without adequate, if any, support services. People with disabilities and their families are in crisis. Service providers are unable to respond to, and governments are not addressing, this strategic issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be realised that caring for a disabled young child is a very different experience from caring for a disabled adult. There is a great diversity in people's caring experiences and much variance in carers' needs. Different issues or concerns will be paramount at particular stages of both the carer's and disabled person's life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The day-to-day care of a severely disabled person is difficult and stressful because it is unrelenting. Pressures of meeting the needs, expectations and demands of other family members as well as of the disabled person impact upon issues such as privacy, space, employment and financial stability. Furthermore, continuous care drains the carer emotionally and physically and can create social isolation, depression and ill health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A growing problem facing Australia is the number of ageing parents. Many have been caring for their son or daughter for 40 or more years with no hope of any change to their lifestyle. Many older people with carer responsibilities are extremely anxious about what will happen to their son or daughter when they die. It is essential that governments help provide quality supported residential options for disabled people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The burden of care on older carers should be relieved. As one elderly carer put it, `My son has the intellectual capacity of a child. However, by law, he is considered an adult. What happens when I die? Will he just fall through the net, becoming a pawn in a system that does not address the issue of compassionate care?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Respite can be a means of conditioning young disabled people, particularly from the age of 30 onwards, against the trauma suffered on the death of a lifelong carer. It must be remembered that the carer may be the only constant human contact that that disabled <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1965"> person has ever had. However, often there is a reluctance on behalf of the carers to use the respite because of the limited availability and the limited awareness of the quality of care, the difficulties in recruiting and maintaining the care providers, the financial concerns, the bureaucratic obstacles, transportation and a reluctance to leave family members with a stranger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Carers must be educated and given the opportunity and access to respite care, including crisis care. Out of the diverse range of formal support needed by carers, this is probably the most critical. Carers want and need respite as a regular ongoing alternative so that they have an opportunity to have a decent quality of life. Respite care must be made available to meet the specific needs of people with care needs at different times in their lives. It must be a flexible system available when carers need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to provide this respite care, financial resources must be made available. I am personally aware of one case where an 80-year-old carer has had to have surgery and has been given a grant from a crisis fund to provide one week's care for her disabled son. There is no provision for any possible ongoing need for either her or her son. The expectation is that even at 80 she will recover and be able to carry on as usual after a week's respite. I hope for her son's sake that she is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Carers need access to service delivery that takes into account the needs of the family unit. The ideal situation would be for consumer focused funding directed to the family to enable them to purchase the service that they need. Appropriateness is the key to helping carers. I call upon the negotiators who will meet to review the three-year Commonwealth-state disability agreement to give particular attention to these needs. I thank the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This private member's motion draws to the attention of parliament one of a number of concerns that this government needs to address in providing adequate services for people with disabilities and for those people who care for them. It must be a major worry for ageing parents who are the sole carers for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their adult children with disabilities that their children are adequately cared for when the parents are unable to carry out this role themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now the appropriate time for the Howard government to give a commitment for additional funds to be made available for the care of handicapped people. I support the remarks of the shadow minister for the aged, family and community services, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), when she speaks of the programs of the previous Labor government and outlines what needs to be done in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking on this private member's motion, I would like to refer to the work of a small group of people within the electorate of Greenway who are providing limited daytime care for between eight and 12 handicapped people. This group is called the Yakatoon Post-School Options and is for handicapped adult people over 18 years of age. The program is for handicapped people who left school after 1993 and is funded by the New South Wales Department of Community Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the many handicapped people who left school before 1993, they have to remain institutionalised or be cared for on a full-time basis at home because there is no funding for a similar program for these people. The group I am speaking about is providing daytime care for some people from the Marsden Home at Parramatta. If more funds were available this program would be able to be expanded to provide daytime care for adults who are presently being looked after at home by parents or who still remain in institutions full time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yakatoon Post-School Options ensures that handicapped people under this program get their medication on time and are trained in living skills that may eventually enable them to move to group homes. In speaking to people involved in this program you hear of horrific cases where handicapped people are not receiving proper care at home&mdash;such as a 15-year-old handicapped boy with no living skills whatsoever being locked up with dogs in a shed in a backyard.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1966">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people such as this come to Yakatoon they require additional assistance because of the lack of previous care, and their progress is generally slow. But you are also advised of noticeable improvement in people when they receive adequate medical attention and training in living skills. This improvement makes the program worth while. There are two full-time staff and two part-time staff employed on this post-school options program. Because of the poor living skills of clients, some need extensive assistance requiring two or more staff to assist with meals and toilet functions. The hours that each client can spend on this program are therefore restricted because of the lack of finance and staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One way of relieving the burden on parents is for people with disabilities to obtain useful employment wherever possible. There are two excellent organisations operating in western Sydney that are involved in finding work opportunities for people with disabilities. I refer to Job Match, an arm of the Northcote society, and METS, the Macquarie Employment Training Service. These two organisations are very worried that Commonwealth funding for their programs will be cut. The end result of such funding cuts would be to push handicapped people back into institutions full time, back into home care and back into full pensions, reducing the employment and living skills education of handicapped people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) for raising this very important motion. It covers an area where there is certainly a lack of concern in the community for handicapped people in particular and certainly for people who are looking after these handicapped people. Therefore, I am very happy to support the motion. I join with other speakers in urging governments involved in negotiating the three-year Commonwealth-state disability agreement to ensure that adequate funds are available for the caring of handicapped people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Riverina)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.22 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) on bringing this important matter to the attention of the House, as most members speaking on this debate have before me. In my experience in the electorate&mdash;particul <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> arly at election time, because that is the only time you get a chance to travel around and knock on the doors of your electorate&mdash;there are two things that do not impress me; in fact they make me very sad. Firstly, you realise that there is terrible loneliness in the community when you knock on some doors and speak to people. These people are so pleased to see you because you are probably the only person they have seen for weeks and they just want someone to talk to; they want that human contact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing I noticed is how fortunate we in Australia are to have a range of support services available to us. Most Australians can normally get by but, when sickness strikes the home or someone has an incapacity or a disability, those affected find they are struggling against the stream. It is a very difficult situation to be in, and we all know people in that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my travels throughout the Riverina I often come into contact with people who I believe deserve our greatest admiration, respect and, above all, help. These people are the carers of the sick, the aged and the disabled. Throughout the Riverina and Australia what has been described as an `invisible army' is at work. Although they include some of the poorest and most disadvantaged people in our society, they contribute to our communities about $8 billion which would otherwise have to be funded by governments&mdash;and we all know governments cannot do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates there are 1.5 million carers in Australia&mdash;or one in every five households. That is a staggering figure. Of these carers, many are providing care for 35 hours a week or more. Caring, as we all know, can be hard work, considering that some carers are no longer young and mobile. They have to feed, bathe, dress, toilet, drive, medicate, supervise, comfort and nurse some of the most vulnerable people in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently we had National Carers Week. During that week, the role of carers was brought to our attention. I am sure that most members in this House would be aware of that role but some may not be. I personally know, as would most members know, of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1967"> parents who have chronically ill children. They take it in turns to sleep because their child has to be turned regularly throughout the night. Many carers have to get the people they are caring for out of bed and to the toilet or into the shower and so on. It takes a great deal of work and effort. As carers become older, it becomes even more difficult for them. I am sure most of my colleagues, as I said before, would know of similar unfortunate situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To a carer, the things that most of us take for granted as everyday pleasures can be a luxury. Many carers would dearly love to have just one night of unbroken sleep or an occasional day off, even though they love the person they are caring for in an indescribable manner&mdash;if they did not they would not be caring for them in the way they do. They would be very grateful for just a few hours off to see a movie or even spend time in the garden to smell the roses. These people experience social isolation, poor emotional wellbeing, lower life satisfaction and feelings of depression and anxiety&mdash;all of which can lead to stress&hyphen;related illnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should all welcome any initiative which recognises the wonderful contribution made to society by all categories of carers but more particularly by the growing number of aged carers, who deserve special consideration in enabling them to access respite from their demanding tasks and to be supported by permanent residential or in-house care services for their dependants. Anything that can be done in this way to assist these people by either federal or state governments will, I am sure, not only support carers but support the whole community and those people who are being cared for. We can imagine the thoughts running through the minds of people being cared for and their love for those caring for them. I once again commend the member for Murray for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, join with other members in commending the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) for putting this motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> . I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to talk to it. The numbers of families in our commu <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> nities across the country who are affected by policy making in this area of social concern are extremely high. There is absolutely no doubt that the demands placed on those who take on the role of carer are enormous&mdash;whatever age group they may be caring for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unique thing about this motion is that it is not so much a chance to speak about the role of carers per se, which I will always be happy to do&mdash;I will always be honoured to refer to the work that people in our community take on when they adopt the role of carer&mdash;but a chance to speak about something additional: the people in the community who have in their families and under their care and control at the moment ageing children&mdash;children who are reaching an older age than ever before have we seen. Parents fear for them in terms of their future accommodation, their future care and their future security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is different to the general role of caring, which I am not in any sense demeaning. We really must look at this additional layer of concern. The medical advances that have been made in our society and our community mean that, joyously, we are living longer and those people afflicted by a disability of some kind are also now living longer. Not that long ago a child born with, for instance, Down syndrome had a far shorter life expectancy. It is now not at all uncommon to see adults with Down syndrome living into their 30s, 40s, 50s and even early 60s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of these people&mdash;I am using them as an example but we are talking about many other people in our community as well&mdash;are generally in the care of their parents. When one parent dies, the remaining parent, generally a female&mdash;I say this purely because of statistics&mdash;continues to care for their child, who may be well into adulthood. The concern that these carers have and that which I think the member for Murray is reflecting in her motion relates to what governments in this country are doing and what the community at large is doing to address the concerns of these carers, who are worried about the future accommodation and security needs of their children.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1968">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My biggest fear, given the current government's policy direction of devolution to states and territories of community care and health care in general, is that we risk dropping the standard of any care available and risk any residential care that is available for these people. At the COAG level&mdash;another issue that is discussed primarily in this motion&mdash;we have to think very carefully, very compassionately and very seriously about what sort of devolution of power and responsibility we are considering giving to the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without citing any specific instances, I know that any one member in this place could cite examples where we have seen, in different cities and parts of the country, battles going on by groups of parents on behalf of their children in relation to the residential care available for those children. In a lot of cases we have seen tragedy occur, in a lot of cases we have seen absolutely unacceptable standards of accommodation and care supplied, and in a lot of cases we have seen no accommodation or residential care given at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an area where I do not think we should be governed by state boundaries. It is an area where the Commonwealth government, in a policy position, should make very clear what we believe in as a community and what we believe we should help to supply for these people, for their security and their ongoing residential care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister earlier in this debate mentioned a group of community organisations who late last week outlined their concern at that very possibility of devolution of the programs to the states and territories. I also refer to that, and refer very quickly to the types of organisations that are included in the statement outlining those concerns. They include the Australian Council of Social Service, the National Industry Association for Disability Services, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission and many others. There are many community organisations who share the level of concern I have. Many in this place share that concern as well. I implore this government and all governments in this country to think very seriously and very constructively about what options can be available for those people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> gives consideration to the adoption of a national wage-earner protection fund scheme as is similarly found in: Japan, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Spain, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Israel, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Quebec and the state of Oregon in the United States of America&mdash;to insure and protect Australian workers from company insolvency;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> conducts an inquiry through the relevant parliamentary standing committee into the viability of, and the benefits associated with, the adoption of a national wage-earner protection fund scheme for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>Several months ago, 680 workers in south&hyphen;western Sydney, most of whom live within my electorate, suddenly found themselves out of a job. Through no fault of their own, the company for which they worked, Exicom Pty Ltd, had collapsed into receivership and subsequent liquidation, with irrecoverable debts totalling almost $50 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workers themselves&mdash;jobless, full of apprehension and anxiety&mdash;had more than the cross of unexpected unemployment to bear. When Exicom shut its doors, it owed its employees a total of $17 million&mdash;$6 million in annual and long service leave entitlements and $11 million in redundancy payments. The redundancy payments expected by the staff were unusually high because most of Exicom's workers had been with the company, and prior to it being taken over by Exicom when it was the telecommunications business AWA, for over 10 years and many up to 20 years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1969">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Exicom's journey towards insolvency was characterised by shoddy management and irresponsible financial deals. As far back as October 1994, Exicom was described by its own chairman, Barry Capp, in an address to the annual shareholder's meeting, as a `nightmare'. It seems that, by March 1996, little had changed; only now Mr Capp's nightmare vision had become a reality for those 680 ordinary workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The story I have just relayed is not unusual. It is noteworthy for the scale on which hundreds of Sydneysiders have suddenly found themselves out of a job, but company insolvencies in Australia are neither unusual nor surprising. Sadly, they are an everyday occurrence around the country. In the 10 months prior to April this year, there were 6,892 company insolvencies. In the 1994&hyphen;95 financial year, there were 7,240 insolvencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business collapse, for whatever reason, is an unfortunate reality of commercial life the world over. While governments of all political persuasions will continue to strive to create a climate where private companies are less likely to meet such unhappy ends, company failure is accepted, albeit regrettably, as a price worth paying for the privilege of operating in our chosen economic framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the financial hardship shouldered by the thousands of Australian workers who lose their jobs every year as a result of insolvency need not be accepted with the same grim resignation. Once we can see, through the example of other countries, that it is unnecessary to subject workers to the unfortunate spin&hyphen;offs associated with company insolvency, I believe it would be irresponsible for us, as the elected representatives of the people who endure these hardships, not to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wage earner protection funds have operated in Western Europe since the late 1960s as a means of protecting workers from company insolvency. The fact that funds now operate in countries and provinces far removed from the traditionally welfare&hyphen;oriented economies of Europe&mdash;for example, in Japan&mdash;I think speaks volumes for the benefits associated with such schemes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A wage earner protection fund can be described simply as an `insurance scheme'. Compulsory contributions are made to protect workers and to guarantee the obligations of their employees in respect of unpaid leave and redundancy payments, should the company for which they work be forced into insolvency. The Australian Law Reform Commission, in its general insolvency inquiry of 1988&mdash;otherwise known as the Harmer report&mdash;described such funds as operating on a basis similar to Medicare. In most cases, the compulsory contributions are made by the employers alone&mdash;a recognition that the risk of insolvency lies entirely with the employers themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there are notable exceptions to this rule. In the Netherlands and Switzerland, for example, the financial burden is shared equally by both employers and workers. As with Medicare, the scheme is based on the underlying principle of mandatory participation. There is no differentiation made between companies which are `good risks' or `bad risks'. As a result, the coverage of the schemes is extensive, with the majority of a nation's workers receiving protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is the practice in the majority of other countries, governments are exempt from participating in the funds. The most common dividing line separating those included and those excluded from making fund contributions is drawn between employers which are liable to liquidation procedures and those which are not, like the government, being excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that wager earner protection funds are based on such solid and non&hyphen;negotiable underlying principles, such as mandatory participation, should not draw members into believing that there is no variation between funds. A wage earner protection scheme in Australia need not merely be introduced as a pale imitation of a European fund. There is enormous scope for a wage earner fund to be introduced into Australia which suits the economic terrain of our society and which meets the expectations of both employers and employees alike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Law Reform Commission received a number of different submissions on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1970"> wage earner protection funds, and I would encourage members interested to look into the wide range of proposals made. The majority of funds already in operation guarantee workers' claims in respect of wages and severance pay, although other categories of claims are also covered, depending on the responsibilities of the social security system in that country, or the maturity or presence of enterprise agreements, which also differ from country to country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In no country does a wage earner protection fund guarantee, without limitation, the entirety of the worker's claims. The returns from such schemes are specified at a set maximum, a figure which also varies between countries. The benefits associated with such funds are obvious. While no amount of social security can guarantee workers will not lose their job when insolvency strikes, at least under such a scheme we can guarantee workers their wages and termination payments should it come to the worst for their company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, workers are guaranteed prompt payment. There is no time spent waiting for the sale of the company's assets or deciding on the priority of payment of creditors over workers. The amount of litigation surrounding the insolvency is also reduced. Workers and workers' representative groups no longer need to seek recourse to the law in order to obtain moneys owed to them. Emergency social security payments&mdash;government money&mdash;is no longer required to support workers and their families when a business collapses unexpectedly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the real value of these funds is that they protect the worker's future. We have recently heard the Treasurer (Mr Costello) talking in this House about `intergenerational, financial impropriety' in relation to protecting the future finances of Australians. If he is concerned, as he says he is, and if the government is really worried about the financial future of ordinary Australian workers, it would give serious consideration to introducing a wage earner protection scheme into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As our international partners and allies have already shown, Australian workers need never&mdash;due to the insolvency of the company <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for which they have worked&mdash;be left in arrears of wages or other entitlements. It is no longer enough that we give our sympathy to workers made redundant from companies such as Exicom in my electorate. These workers deserve more than our sympathy; they deserve our practical and sensible support. I believe that is what the wage earner protection funds offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot put an end to business failure, to company collapse, but we can do something more to safeguard the rights of ordinary Australian workers, the ones who are always the first to suffer from management incompetence or when an unexpected disaster strikes a company during a downturn in the economy. It is, I believe, nothing less than our duty to support this motion before the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently I received a letter from my clerk informing me that a solicitor who owed me fees for work which I had done as a barrister some years ago had proceedings issued against him for bankruptcy. With the usual dispassionate bluntness of many legal documents, the accompanying material revealed that I should forget about ever receiving any payment for the work which I had undertaken. The solicitor's debts ran to several million dollars; his assets ran to very little. After so many years of non&hyphen;payment, I wondered whether I would ever be paid. However, the receipt of the bankruptcy details remains somewhat galling as the solicitor was expected to hold in trust fees for payment. I do not know whether these fees had ever been collected from the clients but, certainly, a failure to preserve them and pay them as appropriate, whether to me or to other people by whom services had been performed, would involve a fundamental breach of trust.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I relate this personal anecdote as an indication that I have some knowledge of the matters which the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) speaks about and intends by her motion, and that I have some sympathy for the people in the position that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1971"> she refers to. I acknowledge that in my case this is not as devastating as for an employee whose whole source of income is lost when a company goes insolvent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem can be simply stated: when a company becomes insolvent, unsecured creditors and employees of that company stand to lose payments which are rightfully due to them. The honourable member's motion proposes a means of protecting employees in that situation by the creation of an employment wage protection fund. The purpose of such a fund would be to provide compensation to employees for outstanding payments owed to them, such as wages, accrued annual leave, long service leave and severance pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Law Institute Journal</EMPHASIS>, Peter Holding estimated that for an employed tradesperson on award wages of $450 a week and who had been employed by a company for 20 years, the level of entitlements could amount to around $14,500. Holding states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One would hardly say that $14,550 is an exorbitant sum to expect to receive upon termination after 20 years service. Yet it is commonplace for employees of insolvent companies to walk away with absolutely nothing, or with paltry amounts like 25 cents in the dollar. Given this situation, one must seriously ask "who really does bear the financial risk in insolvency situations?"</PARA>
<PARA>There are two approaches to the problem. One is to introduce an employee wage protection fund, as envisaged by the honourable member's motion. The other, which has been adopted in this country to date, is to provide under the bankruptcy and insolvency laws a privilege for payments to employees. These two approaches are provided for in convention 173 of the International Labour Organisation. Article three of the convention allows a member country the choice of a guarantee, such as a wage earner protection scheme, or a privilege in insolvency proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 556 of the Corporations Law establishes the priority of debts and claims of unsecured creditors in the event of the winding up of a company. Although there are a number of items listed before employee wages and superannuation, injury compensation payments and retrenchment payments, these <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> items relate to the formal costs of administering and winding up a company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation for employees was improved with the passage of the Insolvency (Tax Priorities) Legislation Amendment Act 1993. Under this legislation, the former priority of the Commissioner of Taxation for the recovery of moneys owed to the commissioner by companies which became insolvent or were liquidated was removed. The main beneficiaries of that piece of legislation were employees of such companies. The complaint made about the current arrangement is that employees are still treated like unsecured creditors and, in many cases, receive little, if anything, where a company is insolvent. Further, it is argued that a legal remedy, even against a director personally, is a problematic exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was considered by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its 1988 report of the general insolvency inquiry. The commission asked whether the rationale for continuing the priority for employees was still relevant&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal rationale for the employee priority has been significantly diminished by the development of a sophisticated social welfare system. Further, the effect of the priority is to deprive other unsecured creditors of their claim to a share of the available assets. Included in that class of unsecured creditors may be small traders who are substantially dependent upon the insolvent for their business and persons who were in an employee&hyphen;like relationship with the insolvent but who are classified (in a strict legal sense) as independent contractors. These creditors may be as vulnerable as employees in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation but enjoy no protection.</PARA>
<PARA>These considerations are important. With the ongoing change to the labour markets in Australia, many people who in earlier times were employees are now independent contractors, as individuals, in partnerships or incorporated small businesses. The current priority for employees does not extend to them. Nevertheless, the commission found strong support for the continuation of the priority payment system for employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report went on to propose that the government give consideration to the creation of an employee wage protection scheme. It was said by the commission that such a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1972"> scheme would, first, guarantee payment; secondly, ensure prompt payment; and, thirdly, reduce litigation over priorities. I note that accord mark 8, proposed for 1995&hyphen;99 by the previous government, included an examination of an employee wage protection scheme. Despite this endorsement, there are a number of issues which I believe require further consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, there would be considerable cost involved in collecting contributions and administering the fund. Secondly, such a fund imposes another cost on the overwhelming majority of well&hyphen;managed companies which meet their obligations to employees. In most countries with a wage earner protection fund, compulsory contributions are made by the employer&mdash;and I note that the honourable member for Prospect gave the instance of two countries at least where employees make contributions as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, such a fund may not reduce litigation, as an element of such a scheme would include a provision to allow the fund to pursue directors for debts subrogated to the fund. Overseas experience suggests that recovery rates are, at the very best, poor. I note that one article suggested that the best recovery rates obtained under the fund against insolvent companies was about one-third.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, suggestions have been made, for example, by the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of Accountants to the Law Reform Commission inquiry, that a fund be run as a social service by the government. Given the existence of unemployment and other social security benefits, many would question the imposition on the taxpayer of further costs in this manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, however, some reasons for examining the scheme in more detail. First, the cost of insolvency extends throughout the community. Where companies fail to make their payments to employees, it is usually the case that they fail to pay other creditors as well. These creditors are usually other tradespersons. Secondly, such a scheme may address the blight of the so-called `phoenix company'&mdash;the phoenix being that creature in Greek mythology that rises from its own <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ashes. These companies are notorious in the building industry. The company with the head contract becomes insolvent. Subsequently, the same directors are found conducting another company with a similar name and enjoying the same lifestyle, and in the meantime subcontractors are without payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two suggestions have been made recently for addressing this issue. The Victorian parliament's Law Reform Committee in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Curbing the phoenix company</EMPHASIS> made a series of recommendations in relation to the establishment of an assetless company fund which would provide a basis for the funding of legal challenges in these circumstances. I note, secondly, that the Public Works Committee of this parliament has, in fact, insisted that in contracts, particularly head contracts, provision be made so that other contractors down the line are protected in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the discussion that has been initiated by the honourable member for Prospect. I believe that measures to preclude persons from abusing the corporate structure, in particular the phoenix company situation, are measures which need careful consideration and attention by the parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion of the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) concerning the need to protect workers' hard&hyphen;won entitlements. As a former trade union official of 20 years full&hyphen;time service, I speak with some experience and emotion concerning this problem. With all respect to the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), I might suggest that the thrust of the proposition is somewhat different from a one&hyphen;off loss of fee for service for a lawyer in an industry with some of the most restrictive work practices in the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for that reason that in my very first speech in this parliament I suggested that one of the biggest issues now and in the future for Australians is security in life. Importantly, at the heart of this question is security at work. Unfortunately, as we all know, in recent decades the old security that most people used to have with their work and their futures has been drastically eroded.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1973">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A prime example of this is workers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry, who know all too well the insecurities that have been caused by the opening up of Australia to world trade. I also refer in passing to the orgy of company takeovers in the 1980s which added to people's job uncertainties and feelings of insecurity, in the same way as the current government's attack on the Public Service is doing across Australia&mdash;just as has, more recently, the destructive fad of downsizing among senior management under which a measure of the size of one's salary package is related to how successful you are in sacking workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this reason, Australians are now demanding that politicians address their growing uncertainties in life&mdash;and we on the Labor side are determined to do so. The former Labor government, I am pleased to say, commenced this. For example, in 1993 it made employees' entitlements a higher priority than those of the tax commissioner when companies went broke&mdash;a major breakthrough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also refer in passing to the decision in 1994 to ratify an ILO convention for the protection of workers' claims in the event of company insolvency. Further, as the member for Menzies said, in accord mark 8, the Labor government agreed to examine and, if desirable, improve employees' protections in such cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion before the House is aimed at getting this parliament to now inquire&mdash;not resolve but inquire&mdash;into the possibility and the details of adopting a wage earner protection fund for all Australians. I regard that as the next vital step in a process of development that has been pursued over the last couple of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that, when companies fail through mismanagement or other causes, workers not only lose their jobs but unfortunately and all too often lose their wages and accumulated entitlements, including access to annual leave and long service leave. I believe that they are duly owed those entitlements and that we as a nation are obligated to go out of our way to ensure they receive their full and proper entitlements. There are also often delays in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> receiving their back pay when such a situation occurs. I know from personal experience as a union official the great hardship that such circumstances cause working people and their families, especially those in regional communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also know that, more often than not, such hardship unfortunately falls on the lowest paid and less industrially strong in the community, because they all too often work in the industries confronted by structural change which results in many companies going under. On that note, I suggest it is crystal clear from previous investigations in Australia and from the experience of other countries that wage earner protection funds are economically viable and socially necessary in a civilised modern nation. We need a parliamentary inquiry now, not later, to ensure that we properly investigate this constructive proposal. We need it in order to push the policy debate along and to give Australians a greater sense of security and hope for the future in one of the most important areas of their lives: namely, their work and their security with respect to the capacity to look after their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, I commend this motion to the House and ask that the government not walk away from its responsibilities to look after working people at a time of uncertainty and so ensure that employers are required to face up to their full and proper obligations with respect to workers' accumulated entitlements.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to add a few words in general commendation of the motion put forward by the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). I was also very interested to hear the comments of the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) in general support of the motion. Like most honourable members here, I have had some experience in these areas dealing with constituents in hardship, subcontractors who more frequently than not are being struck down and forced into insolvency and bankruptcy because a head contractor has gone into liquidation and insolvency, and of course employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate at the moment in Wodonga one of the very large export abattoirs unhappily has closed its doors. More than 300 of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1974"> my constituents have been left as unsecured creditors&mdash;employees along with a lot of other people, including subcontractors. A friend of mine who is a building subcontractor is owed $35,000, which is an enormous amount of money for him and his family to lose. They may well go under; I hope they don't. So I have a fair bit of passion about this issue. My own approach to it, frankly, is to ask that more lateral thinking be applied to this problem. For example, the Commonwealth now, to its credit, requires the head contractor to certify and to produce evidence that subcontractors have been paid before progress payments are made on construction jobs. I fought for years to get that in the state. I am very happy to see that the Commonwealth has done that. That is the sort of lateral thinking we can adopt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it would not take much ingenuity to devise a scheme whereby companies are encouraged and even rewarded under a code of ethics or accreditation systems to introduce practices where they put into trust accounts that are legally shielded from liquidation the accumulated sums that a good company under good management should put aside each month towards long service and annual leave. Then the legal problems would be solved. Once a fund is identified as a trust fund for legal entitlements for employees, it cannot be siphoned off with proper management, care and auditing towards the other claims in the event of an insolvency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we should concentrate on and direct our minds to a lot of the practical ways of helping, because none of us here want to put an added burden on businesses. We all know the problem of unemployment and getting businesses to invest, take risks and save. We need to ensure that small business in particular is not faced with more levies and more burdens. That is our responsibility. Anyone in this current parliament who does anything to add to the burden of business will have a lot to answer for, because that would detract from the employment prospects. Using lateral thinking, we could find lots of ways of ensuring added protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very welcome legislation that was brought in to put the Deputy Commissioner <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Taxation behind employees was legislation that we all worked hard to get. I must say I was very frustrated that it took so long. There was a bus company that crashed in Victoria, and the employees there fought for years against the tax commissioner. Actually, from memory I think the tax commissioner took them to the Hight Court to oppose their application for priority. The employees were out borrowing money to pay their rent while the tax commissioner took them to the High Court. I did not like that at all: none of us did. The legislation that went through was good legislation and I supported it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to be too political, and therefore it is a little ironic that in the last few seconds of my speech I have to reflect that this motion by the opposition comes after 13&half; years of its being in government. I think it is only fair that I should put that in context. I was not going to do that, but the honourable member for Batman, in what should have been a non-party political contribution, attempted once again to put the class war. He attempts to divide the community needlessly and attempts to put employers risking capital at odds with employees wanting to share with employers in the development of exciting and innovative business opportunities and job opportunities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make that comment in passing, but nevertheless with a fair bit of fervour. However, enough of that. Too many opportunities have been lost in Australia in the last decade because people have been discouraged to invest and take risks. Unless we encourage them to do that, we will not achieve our full potential and, even worse, our young people in Australia will be denied employment opportunities. We must understand that there is a change in Australia, and the honourable member for Batman should take that into account. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) on moving this motion and note that essentially the motion calls for an inquiry. In that context I think a number of the points raised by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) can be given consideration. In particular he referred to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1975"> possibility of a trust fund, as opposed to a scheme for a wage earner protection fund. These things can be debated. Essentially, as I have seen trust schemes operate, they are not entirely different from wage earner protection schemes, except that the pool of funds is held by the employer, albeit on behalf of a class of persons, namely, their workers who have the entitlement to long service leave, severance pay and the like. That sort of arrangement could readily be accommodated without incurring the costs which were the concerns of the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). Again these things can be worked out in the processes of such an inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like other members, regrettably I have had considerable experience in this area, practising primarily in industrial law for 15 years. I have seen a number of instances where, depressingly, I have had to advise clients facing their employer's company going into receivership that there was no prospect of recovering their monies. Indeed, any legal proceedings to do so are automatically stayed as a result of winding&hyphen;up proceedings being commenced. The existing Corporations Law provides a rating of priorities for payments and it necessarily means that bankruptcy proceedings have to await finality, which itself causes considerable delay to the workers receiving their pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been acknowledged, quite often we are talking about substantial amounts and that really arises from the 1984 test cases on termination and redundancy in case of economic downturn. Since that time it has been commonplace for severance pay to be paid to workers facing that situation and a number of state governments have introduced legislation providing similar benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point was raised as to why it has taken 13 years and whether it is justified or not, but in the past perhaps we have been talking about only relatively small amounts of arrears of holiday pay and a few weeks pay. We are now talking about substantial amounts of money. This applies certainly in the case of someone over 40 years of age. The statistics are that they are very unlikely to get employment, certainly in the short term.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am now 38 years of age and in another two years time I will be in that category. It is a time in your life when you most probably incur higher mortgage commitments because you need a bigger home to accommodate your kids. It is probably a time of life when you incur school fees and other training fees, but certainly at that time of life your expenses are family related rather than self&hyphen;related. That is a time when the consequences of redundancy are so devastating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their maiden speeches a number of the new Liberal members spoke of their goals to remove what they described as the habit of welfare. If they are consistent with their argument so that people who are facing devastation are not thrown onto the habit of welfare, they need the protection of a wage earner protection scheme or the like, whether it be a trust fund or some other alternative. I commend the member for Prospect for moving this motion. It is essential that such a scheme be introduced and this parliament should look into it as a matter of urgency.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to assure the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) that this idea has been looked at over the period of the previous government and is not a new one before this parliament in any sense. The motion, whilst appearing to promote what, on the surface, could be a good idea, in fact serves to raise a number of points which highlight the former Labor government's mismanagement during its 13&hyphen;year term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the need for such a scheme was never greater than in the years of Labor's boom&hyphen;bust policies, which were responsible for the worst unemployment since the Great Depression 60 years earlier. Many of those who found themselves in the growing dole queues during the Labor years were victims of companies which went to the wall in `the recession we had to have'. Where was the scheme then?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a so&hyphen;called national wage earner protection scheme&mdash;which, I might add, is certainly not a new concept&mdash;had such merit, then why was it not instituted at the time of most need&mdash;the Labor years? This question takes on an even greater magnitude when placed in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1976"> the context of ACTU policy on the issue. It seems the Labor government chose to ignore the unions' peak body, which had earlier supported the creation of such a fund into which all employers would be required to contribute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that during the speech made by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) indicated that she had had an experience in March of this year which apparently brought it to her attention. I want to assure her that she is not the first person on the planet on this subject. Last year this was watered down somewhat in accord mark 8, which merely included agreement to look at the possibility of moving to improve the protection of employees' entitlements. That is what the government did with the ACTU just last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor was reluctant to introduce an actual protection fund during its own term, and yet it is trying to promote it now from the opposition back benches. But credit where credit is due&mdash;Labor did go some way towards improving the position of redundant employees in the pecking order of creditors. Labor's most recent reforms to corporate law in 1993 saw redundant employees placed ahead of the Tax Office in order of priority when a company went into liquidation. This issue was raised then, if the member for Prospect had been listening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition certainly agreed with the prime objective of the Insolvency (Tax Priorities) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. In his second reading speech on that bill, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) described it as `laudable', but warned:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . concerns about its operation have been expressed by many notable lawyers and people familiar with the application of the Corporations Law Reform Bill. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Nonetheless, the amendments saw the system still falling well short of an ACTU preferred fund that would guarantee the payment of workers' accrued entitlements upon insolvency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mind you, such schemes as they similarly exist in many overseas countries&mdash;and this is referred to in the motion&mdash;particularly within the European Community, are not as cut and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dried as the motion would have them appear. They have vast variations, not only in legal definition and administration, but also largely as they reflect the welfare policies of each nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some countries, these schemes are administered as a state welfare fund&mdash;definitely a big ticket item for the government of the day&mdash;whilst in others they are merely insurance schemes. In many participating countries these are funded solely by employers, or, in a few cases, both employers and employees share the burden. Either way, it was obviously a system placed decisively in Labor's too&hyphen;hard basket during its term in office, despite being canvassed by the Law Reform Commission in 1988 in its general insolvency inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the lead&hyphen;up to the inquiry, the commission sought views on the establishment of a wage earner protection fund to which all employers and employees would contribute, which would have its contributions collected with the payment of tax&mdash;such as the Medicare levy&mdash;and which would allocate the administration of payouts to the liquidator. Needless to add, the commission received many submissions supporting a wage earner protection fund, although most supporters did not accept that employees should have to make any contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite Professor Harmer's recommendation for a protection fund to be considered, Labor took the soft option of simply beefing up the employee priority in the hierarchy of claims&mdash;a sort of safety net with holes&mdash;to allow the claims of employees as creditors to jump the queue ahead of the Taxation Office but still behind those associated with the winding up of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his report, Professor Harmer questioned the relevance of the rationale of the priority system. He noted that the priority was first introduced into insolvency legislation for social welfare reasons but that the `effect of the priority is to deprive other unsecured creditors of their claim to a share of the available assets'. He went on to note&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;that the unsecured creditors may include `small traders who were substantially dependent upon the insolvent for their business'.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1977">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, Labor had an opportunity to ratify the International Labour Organisation convention concerning the security of employee entitlements upon insolvency in one of two ways: either by a privilege in the ranking of claims or protection by a guarantee institution or fund. When the Keating government ratified the convention, it only accepted the former. Of course, that was not surprising, given the economic circumstances at the time. The perceived cost impact would have been political suicide in that period of skyrocketing cost burdens on the business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian business sector was buckling under an avalanche of government imposed impediments, such as the increasing employer contributions to employee superannuation. And now, another few years on, what do you know? The idea of a national wage earner protection fund scheme is resurrected yet again. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I would like to deal, in the short time available to me, with some of the objections that people have raised with my office to the proposed gun control laws. In doing so, can I say I have had several hundred people approach my office opposing what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has put forward which has been supported by nearly every member in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did a survey of these approaches the other day and 98 per cent of the objections were from males. To the best of my judgment, 90 per cent were in excess of 50 years old and 95 per cent were in excess of 40 years old. The concern in this area seems to be primarily an elderly male one&mdash;and make of that what you will. If I may deal with some of the objections, they say that these proposals `brand innocent people as criminals'. I think this was best answered by Associate Professor Simon Chapman, who, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is rather like feeling insulted at being required to open your bag at the supermarket checkout, at having to walk through a metal detector at an airport, at being pulled over for random breath&hyphen;testing.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind these people that you cannot identify who will offend. Only 15 per cent of those who do offend have a previous history of mental instability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another objection that is coming in thick and fast to my office is that this transgresses the 1688 Bill of Rights, which guarantees you the right to bear arms. I have looked up the Bill of Rights, and it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the subjects which are protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.</PARA>
<PARA>Leaving out the offensive fact that this rules out Catholics, Jews, Muslims and everybody else having the right to own arms, it seems to me that, even if we conceded the fact that the Bill of Rights can be amended from time to time according to the conditions of the country, it perfectly fits the Bill of Rights. It says that you may hold arms `suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law'. That is all we are doing. We are certainly not banning all firearms.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1978">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another objection is that the legislation that is being proposed was drawn up in 1981. Apart from the fact that it is not true&mdash;the legislation has not yet been drawn up&mdash;even if it were true, so what? I remind these people that the federal Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) is drawing this up in conjunction with the police ministers of all the states and territories around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Possibly the most repugnant suggestion that I have had is that we&mdash;that is me and the coalition&mdash;set up this massacre so that we could introduce this legislation. I do not think that I should perhaps comment further on that. A lot of them have challenged&mdash;dared me, indeed&mdash;to hold a referendum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, I condemn the misinformation that is going around on this matter and which has been whipped up by some groups. The Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (New South Wales) Inc. has written something which has been put on my desk today. I am disappointed to see what they say because my own 13&hyphen;year&hyphen;old son is a junior member of this association. They say that 80 per cent of Australian target shooting will be banned. On another page of the document, they say that about 80 per cent of gun owners will be banned with no compensation. That is absolute, ridiculous nonsense. Indeed, if they cared to read what is being put out, some of it is quite reasonable indeed. I am pleased to say that I am now receiving letters from the farming community around my electorate in particular saying, `Hang in there. We support what is being proposed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a person whose maiden speech in 1984 in the state parliament dealt very specifically with this issue, I am pleased to associate myself with this gun control motion and with the effort of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to make overdue changes to gun laws in this country. I also wish to deal with a few aspects of what is being claimed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the points being made by the gun control opponents is that the broad mass of Australia has been overwhelmed by emotion and there has been no logical thinking on this matter. The reality is that what Australians say now is what they have consistently said over the past few decades. In September 1995, 93 per cent of Australians supported a gun register. In  1978, 78 per cent of Tasmanians supported gun licensing. A New South Wales Department of Health survey earlier this year indicated that 92 per cent of the urban population and 80 per cent of rural residents supported compulsory annual registration of weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In August 1991, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> published a poll that indicated that 90 per cent of those surveyed would support the banning of semiautomatics and 67 per cent believed that only those people who absolutely need them for their employment should have guns. So there is a long, sustained support in the Australian electorate for restrictive gun laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am afraid to say that, if we fail this time, the situation will only deteriorate further. There are some very important statistics from the United States in regard to a distinction between gun owners and the mass of the population in what they think about this issue. A United States report of 15 August 1994 polled people according to various categories&mdash;males, females. The poll indicated that only 42 per cent of the people who owned guns supported gun licensing whereas those who did not own guns had a 58 per cent support for licensing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a growth spiral of more and more people feeling threatened, more and more people seeing that others in their suburbs have guns, more and more people owning guns and more and more people with a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1979"> very strong, sustained vested interest in the proliferation of guns. The average person is essentially against gun ownership, wants licensing and wants restrictions. As I say, as more and more people have this vested interest, the situation deteriorates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great furphies exposed over a decade ago by people like Frank Zimring is the concept that if you have a gun in your home you will be able to use it against an assailant or against burglars. The sad fact of life is that that gun is more generally used on the householder than it is on the burglar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Arthur Kellerman's analysis in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New England Journal of Medicine</EMPHASIS> of Seattle homicides over a six&hyphen;year period concluded that, for every case of self&hyphen;protection homicide involving a firearm kept in the home, there were 1.3 accidental deaths, 4.6 criminal homicides and 37 suicides involving firearms&mdash;an overall ratio of 43 to one. In other words, for every time that a burglar might have been shot by a person half asleep in bed, if they actually managed to get hold of a gun, 43 people were suicide victims or accidentally shot&mdash;10&hyphen;year&hyphen;old kids shot by their seven&hyphen;year&hyphen;old brother, for instance. These are the kinds of realities that exist out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth indicating from Kellerman's work, which has been verified by a number of private corporation surveys of Canadian gun laws, that one of the great comparisons in this respect is that between Canada and the United States. As an island continent, Australia does not have a lot of similarities with the United States, but Canada shares a mainland border with the United States and has a lot of similar patterns. Yet there is a very clear differentiation between gun homicides in Canada and in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kellerman indicated in 1988 after a seven&hyphen;year study of Vancouver and Seattle that there were similar crime levels in all offences, bar those involving guns. In that situation there was a 4.8 to one&mdash;nearly five to one&mdash;difference in regard to the risk of being murdered with a hand gun. It is clear from the evidence from Canada, which has opted for restrictive gun laws and has strengthened them on a number of occasions&mdash;mostly recently in the last year or so and, earlier, in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1991&mdash;that gun laws do matter, that they do change things and that they do protect the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I associate myself very clearly with this motion. I commend the Prime Minister for his efforts. It is quite clear that the Australian electorate in overwhelming numbers not only endorses this legislation but has been consistently calling for it over the last few decades.</PARA></SPEECH>

The reflective and thoughtful comments of the member for Reid are worthy of considerable attention by members of this House as they reflect upon what is going to be a hard process over the next few weeks while the community continues the debate about the measures that will be introduced in all states and territories as part of a national agreement to regulate the use and availability of firearms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that process, the opposition has stood with the government so that we can bring into effect a society which is not shaken by the kind of madness that has afflicted some societies where gun ownership is more readily available and where the rhetoric of rights with respect to gun usage has become part of the system. What has been said here, that we do have a moment in which there is an opportunity for us to press ahead and to get an outcome, is a very sensible and sound position for us to be taking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to bear in mind that the vast majority of people in Australia who possess firearms are perfectly reasonable, sensible, law-abiding citizens. They own firearms because they have been trained in their use, probably by their fathers or mothers before them, and they have used them on their farms or to hunt in ways which they regard as part of their entitlement as citizens of this country. Certainly none of them would regard themselves in any way as responsible in whole or in part for incidents of the kind that sponsored our resolve as a nation to take action after the Port Arthur matter.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1980">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is important for us to acknowledge that the vast majority of people who own firearms in this country are mature and responsible. We have to deal with those members of our community carefully and make sure that their interests are taken into account and not ignored. But that debate should be on the basis of an acceptance of the government's and the opposition's determination to press ahead with the framework agreement that was decided by the premiers. Given the time and the desire of other members to take part in this debate, I will bring my remarks to a close.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few comments today because it is important that, while we have been addressing the question of gun control for some time and its significance in reducing the level of violence in our community, certainly the capacity for the mass killings that we have seen not only in Tasmania, very sadly, but also on other occasions in Victoria and in New South Wales, to give recent examples, we do not ignore the wider question of community violence and we do not restrict our objections and investigations to matters that are perhaps popular in the public imagination, including the treatment of violence on television. I would certainly urge the government that in looking at the question of community violence it look very closely at its own programs&mdash;programs that have been developed partly in response to the last committee that was established to examine violence, the National Committee on Violence. Its recommendations, some 138 of them made in 1990, provide the basis for a very substantial set of solutions to community violence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of programs are in jeopardy right now. That is the warning I want to issue. The Office of the Status of Women has had carriage of substantial education programs that deal with the question not just of domestic violence&mdash;although principally that&mdash;but also violence in the community directed towards women, which is endemic in our community, sadly. The Office of the Status of Women have already been told that they will have some 46 per cent of their staff, of their programs, cut. They have been told, as I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> understand it, that there is to be no program delivery. That would include the whole of that substantial program directed at changing attitudes towards violence against women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen considerable success in that agenda already, beginning in 1987, when we found some attitudes towards violence against women that certainly deserved to be condemned and repudiated. We have made substantial progress in conjunction with the states through national leadership and a national campaign to at least get members of the community to recognise that violence against women, whether in the domestic circumstance or elsewhere, is simply not acceptable. To have that program put under threat, as it appears to be, and certainly without leadership, is of growing concern to me and to many other groups in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the coalition through its minister responsible committed itself to a national summit on domestic violence to be held later this year. That was something that it promised in the election campaign. How it relates to these broader questions of ongoing programs is not clear. Senator Newman, who is responsible, suggested to a meeting of women's organisations last week that the Office of the Status of Women would organise it, that it would be a summit of 100 experts and that it would be small and focused rather than a talkfest. That is all very well, but having a steering committee of public servants is hardly representative of the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage I would have to say that I think the focus is wrong and the process is wrong. Why, for instance, limit it to domestic violence? It should be broader, so that issues concerning sexual assault and violence against women generally that occur outside the home can also be discussed. The focus of this summit is no doubt wrong because the process of setting it up is wrong, not least because the minister has already excluded a number of non-government organisations from the steering committee. For instance, the Women's Emergency Services Network is not included on the steering committee. I would like to know whether the minister believes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1981"> that an organisation that supports on a daily basis some 12,000 women and children would have nothing to contribute to the organisation of such a summit. I would have thought they were critical. She says she wants a summit of experts. I would have to say again that the view that these people who deliver services on a daily basis are not expert is insulting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A whole range of programs is at risk at the moment, including women's health programs, family planning funding, and accommodation. These are all critical areas that support women and their families, who are the subject already of violence in the home and who are at risk. We have already initiated a substantial legal reform process and yet there are threatened cuts to Family Court mediation and counselling. Everyone knows that matters surrounding divorce, property settlement and custody often provoke violence. To cut those programs is short-sighted indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, there are a number of threats to family incomes, threats to the Medicare rebate, extra state taxes and charges, extra costs to families in Austudy and HECS, and there will be a particular impact for regional communities in things like cutting the diesel fuel rebate. These will all have an impact on families' incomes. Again, financial problems are almost always likely to produce difficulties in the domestic environment and the wider family. So if the government is really serious about the control of violence in our community, and although we certainly welcome the controls on guns and firearms legislation&mdash;we have always been behind it&mdash;it must be much broader than that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion. In particular, I want to put on record my heartfelt sympathy to the families and friends of all the victims of the dreadful massacre at Port Arthur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was almost impossible to contemplate that such a thing could happen in this country. Even as someone who has practised criminal law for about 13 years, I found it very difficult to realise the magnitude of that sort of an act, its consequences for so many people and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for our whole nation, namely, a loss of innocence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years there have been a number of quite tragic events going beyond family violence. Over the years there has been a number of mass shootings. At the time there was a lot of talk about those events but, ultimately, nothing was done when the political imperative required that something be done. The community cannot tolerate the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in particular, the weapon that was used at Port Arthur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said in the community that this legislation will not prevent a recurrence of the Port Arthur massacre. It is probably fair to say that no legislation could guarantee that. But, equally, it cannot be said that this sort of legislation might not prevent such a tragedy from recurring. That, really, is the point that has to be noted. The proposed legislation might prevent a Port Arthur from occurring. So the political leaders around this country on both sides of the parliaments have supported the need to bring in legislation to try to prevent such an eventuality from recurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of ill&hyphen;informed comment. I guess as members we have all experienced a flood of letters into our electorate offices. I had an unpleasant experience last week when somebody sent me a white feather on a blank sheet of paper with a black dot in the middle. I describe that experience as unpleasant because of its connotations. However, it has strengthened my resolve to support the legislation. Far from any cowardly connotations that that sort of letter appears to convey, if anything, I would suggest that members who have received that sort of rubbish have had their resolve strengthened to see this matter through to its end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, if the measure is not accepted by the Australian people as a whole, the Australian people can vote on that at the appropriate time. But it is my view that the Australian people as a whole do accept the need for this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should also be noted that over the years in my practice it was always my experience that the people who threatened these sorts of acts never carried them out. It was always the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1982"> people you would never expect who carried out these sorts of acts. So much, really, for the suggestion that we should have a register of all people who have had some psychological or psychiatric counselling, or something of that nature. How would you ever identify those people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, I support this motion of condolence to the people of Port Arthur&mdash;the families, victims and friends of those people. But it is also a recognition of the services performed by the police and emergency services, and a recognition of the bipartisan approach to the need to address adequate law reform in this area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House has probably heard about Jeff Kennett riding in on a white charger to save Ultrafine, the Victorian knitting company, and how he bought the machine personally after telling the agent, `If you don't sell it to me, I'll get the unions to black&hyphen;ban this machine and prevent it from leaving the country.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party spends fully half its intellectual energy trying to denigrate, blacken and bad&hyphen;mouth the role of unions. Yet when the chips are down and the Premier of Victoria and the Western District establishment </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>really need help, who do they call? The trade union movement!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House has probably also heard how Mr Kennett misused his resources as opposition leader, using the opposition leader's car and driver to collect and deliver wages to Seymour and how he held Ultrafine board meetings in the opposition leader's parliament house office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House may even recall him saying as opposition leader at the launch of Ultrafine products back in 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would sooner be involved in a knitting&hyphen;led recovery than a gambling&hyphen;led recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, Premier, look at you now!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what the House won't know, because it has never been put on the public record before, is what happened to two of my constituents, David and Josie Powers, after the Kennetts decided to get out of the Ultrafine business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In October 1991, Jeff Kennett told Mr and Mrs Powers, the founders of Ultrafine, that he wanted out of the business. They were able to buy him out with a Commonwealth Development Bank loan. The books provided by Felicity and Jeff Kennett claimed that Ultrafine had recorded a $5,000 profit over the previous seven months. But Kennett would not allow Mr and Mrs Powers to examine the books until 9 January 1992, the day before settlement was due.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When David and Josie Powers did examine the books, the books did not seem right. They quickly discovered a $10,000 error. They faxed this information to the Kennett solicitors insisting on a $10,000 adjustment and a clause in the agreement which would force Mr Kennett to make good any further errors uncovered on a more detailed examination of the books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the settlement, Mr O'Sullivan's brother, a chartered accountant, went through the books thoroughly. Instead of a $5,000 profit, the company had made a $166,000 loss. No wonder the Kennetts wanted out. Mr O'Sullivan, the accountant, made the observation that a child of three could have kept a better set of books. An account of $6,500 had been presented twice. But the biggest payment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1983"> was of over $50,000 to KNF, the Kennetts' own company. The invoices to KNF had been written out one after the other immediately prior to the sale, clearly after the Kennetts had realised that they were going to be bought out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state election was approaching in 1992. The Powers wanted to recover the $160,000 from the Kennetts. They were prepared to go public on the matter. However, Mr O'Sullivan, a staunch Western District Liberal, was having none of this. He insisted that the matter be dealt with behind the scenes and offered to use his Liberal Party connections to set things right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, publicity before the state election would have taken the gloss off Kennett's knitting mill venture and the strong inference that Kennett had attempted to defraud his business partners would have been very damaging to his reputation in small business and the general community. It probably would not have looked too good either if KNF's figures had come out prior to the 1992 election. Over the previous three years, it had made a loss. Mr Kennett could not run a small business successfully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr and Mrs Powers had concluded that, during the years of opposition, KNF was simply a front and that there was no advertising work being conducted at the Warrigal Road premises. But the matter was hushed up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the election, Mr O'Sullivan did write to the new Premier pointing out the errors in the accounts and seeking redress. The Premier's solicitors wrote back telling him to get lost. So the Powers and the O'Sullivans sought legal advice. That advice suggested that they take legal action against the Kennetts and seek to recover $120,000. But that advice was never acted on because a set of events was about to unfold which would destroy the Powers' business interests completely and cause them to regret the day they met Jeff Kennett on the steps of Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Enter Philip Gardiner, financier and founding director of the Macquarie Bank, the very bank which is financing Crown Casino and Transurban City Link&mdash;Mr Kennett's two favourite projects. Mr Gardiner's assets are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believed to exceed $20 million and his company involvements are many. Why would he be interested in being a shareholder in this small struggling company?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Gardiner and two wool growers offered to invest in Merino Gold, a subsidiary company of Ultrafine. They offered to buy 38 per cent of Merino Gold on the basis of 300,000 shares at $1 each. Strangely enough, when the Powers went back to them and said that the cost of the shares would be $1.42 each, they did not bat an eyelid. Mr Gardiner was obviously very keen to get in on this company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the new shareholders got in, what did they do? Mr Gardiner immediately proposed that Ultrafine be dissolved and that the company be run through the Merino Gold subsidiary. This was an illogical proposal except for one thing. Ultrafine was the company which had the right to sue the Kennetts. With Ultrafine dissolved, the Premier could go on his merry way free of the fear of litigation and free of being unmasked as someone who had attempted to defraud his small business partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr and Mrs Powers resisted this move, so Mr Gardiner and the other new shareholders also moved on the other part of their plan&mdash;to get rid of Mr and Mrs Powers. Given that the Powers had all the technical expertise of the company and that it was their baby, this move was very strange. Nevertheless, Mr Gardiner proceeded. In January 1995, Mr and Mrs Powers were dismissed as managing directors and the locks on the Ultrafine building were changed. Employment contracts which had been drawn up for them were terminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr and Mrs Powers' subsequent action for wrongful dismissal was an uphill battle. The new directors of Ultrafine and Merino Gold were holding a loaded financial gun at their heads. They could at any time liquidate the companies and the Powers would lose everything. The case was resolved with the Powers' properties being released from mortgage and them receiving three months pay of a two-year contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 7 May this year, David and Josie Powers had the minor satisfaction of winning a court action brought against them arising from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1984"> the boardroom coup of January 1995. They represented themselves, while the other side hired a QC. So a director of the Macquarie Bank has the time for this!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So David and Josie Powers, two hard-working and decent private sector people who each had highly paid jobs and technical expertise which had them set for a comfortable retirement, are now both unemployed. David is being badmouthed around the wool industry by the Merino Gold directors and their lives have been consumed by litigation. All their income from the Merino Gold venture has been consumed by legal fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So their lives have been all but ruined. How did this happen? Jeff Kennett, that champion of small business, that champion of the little man, rode into their lives on that white charger of political opportunism, took over their finances and then left them for dead when they were no longer of any use to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Day after day in the Victorian parliament I heard his sanctimonious lectures about the importance of the private sector and small business. In the last few weeks, I have learnt that his business dealings with two of my constituents have been nothing short of scandalous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 1309(1) of the Corporations Law makes it an offence to make available or furnish information to another director which is false or misleading in a material particular. Section 1309(2) makes it an offence if a director fails to take reasonable steps to ensure that information supplied to another director is not false or misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 232 of the Corporations Law imposes on directors a duty to act honestly and a duty to exercise care and diligence. If the information provided to me is correct, the Premier has in all probability breached these laws. This apparent attempt by Jeff Kennett to defraud his small business partners should now be examined by the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In addition, the Senate committee inquiring into casinos should also examine this transaction as part of a general investigation of the links between the Macquarie Bank and the Crown Casino. How fortuitous it is for Premi er Kennett that a director of the Macquarie Bank&mdash;the same bank that has just made $36 million from financing Kennett's City Link project&mdash;should have got rid of David and Josie Powers from Ultrafine and Merino Gold so that Kennett's own little sandwich shop could be swept under a woollen carpet. The Premier's lack of ethics in business or anywhere else needs to be the subject of the closest scrutiny. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I am very pleased to rise in the chamber to talk about the wonderful progress that has been achieved over the last couple of years towards the establishment of the Sunshine Coast University College, which was recently opened by the Governor of Queensland, Her Excellency Mrs Leneen Forde AC. I was honoured to be present at the opening of stage 1 of the university campus as the representative for the federal Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone. My parliamentary colleague, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), was also present and we both have the honour of being the parliamentary representatives for the Sunshine Coast community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Fairfax, like me, has been a strong supporter of the Sunshine Coast University College. We know that this is a very important institution and a very important base for the continued development of the region. It really ought to be highlighted that the opening of the Sunshine Coast University College is probably the last opening of a freestanding greenfield university that we can expect to see for a generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of course currently referred to as the Sunshine Coast University College. I hope that it is possible to allow the university to reflect its status as an independent institution. It ought to be able to drop the term `college', which tends to work against its continued growth and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other university colleges in this country are colleges of established universities whereas the Sunshine Coast University College is a freestanding institution with its own act of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1985"> Queensland Parliament. The sooner the Sunshine Coast University College is able to drop the `college' tag the better so that it will be able to grow, prosper and continue to perform a very important role of providing tertiary education in the Sunshine Coast area. The university will be a focal point for the region as a whole. It will serve as a tremendous asset for the Sunshine Coast community and indeed for employment growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opening of stage 1 by Her Excellency the Governor represented a very great moment for the Sunshine Coast. I remember over 10 years ago that a committee was formed on the Sunshine Coast to push for a tertiary institution in our area. Many people at the time said that Mrs Alison Kerr-Jones, one of the visionaries behind the university, would not be able to achieve what ultimately now exists in bricks and mortar. The critics were proved wrong. The Sunshine Coast community worked together as a region and we now have a freestanding greenfield university which has been able to attract staff of very great calibre and quality from right around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was impressed to see a very large cross&hyphen;section of the Sunshine Coast community at the official opening. Professor Paul Thomas, the founding vice-chancellor of the university, has done a wonderful job of building up this institution from scratch. As I go around the various chambers of commerce and other community groups in my electorate, I find Paul Thomas there. He never misses an opportunity to promote the Sunshine Coast University College and to encourage its continued expansion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a competitive society universities must go out and market themselves. No longer can they expect that automatically they will receive funding and that as a matter of course everything will fall into their laps. Paul Thomas has been innovative and is a person to whom the Sunshine Coast owes a very great debt. If it had not been for Paul Thomas, the university would not have got off to the excellent start that it has this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will have its own degrees and full-time staff who have taught and researched at other universities. Of course, the university will have a policy and financial commitment to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support both teaching and research&mdash;and that is vital if a university is going to be successful. The university will also have a clear intention to be both regionally and internationally significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was just one of those events where I, as a Sunshine Coast representative, was able to take great pride in what we have been able to achieve as an area. The Sunshine Coast is one of the fastest growing parts of Australia and projected continued growth indicates that this will go on into the future. A strong university presence is important, vital and necessary&mdash;and now we have it. It is essential that government continues to support the growth of the Sunshine Coast University College.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that demand for places at the university college has been very strong, that most of the students are local and that many of them put down the Sunshine Coast University College as their first choice of a tertiary institution to attend. The fact that this has happened is testimony to the very strong backing the Sunshine Coast University College enjoys right throughout the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously the presence of our own university will demonstrate the benefits to local people of having a university education. The new Howard government sees regional universities and their role as being very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It must also be recognised that all universities had modest beginnings. Most have subsequently grown into major institutions of national significance and excellence with substantial records of achievement. My view is that, without a doubt, the Sunshine Coast University College will take its place among the best of Australia's universities in the next century as an independent institution. It has obviously had the opportunity to draw on the experiences of others. I believe it will build on those experiences, and it will certainly have a focus on the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1986">  I must say that I am genuinely impressed with the quality of the academic staff the university has been able to attract. I am indebted to the Chancellor, Mr Justice Fitzgerald, for the information he provided in his address at the opening of the university. He said that there were 1,700 applicants from around the world for the first 20 or so posi tions advertised. He also mentioned that the six latest staff appointments to the arts faculty all came from established universities, including universities located in Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is obvious that this institution has an important role to play in the future of the Sunshine Coast. I know that the government has inherited an $8 billion black hole as a result of mismanagement by the former Labor government. I can see the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) is nodding in agreement at the fact that we have to plug the $8 billion black hole that his colleagues left for us. We intend to do so. I hope that in doing so it will be possible to make sure that we have in place policies which will guarantee the continued growth of the Sunshine Coast University College. The college's opening this year was much overdue, but the college offers great opportunities to people on the Sunshine Coast and throughout the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government must recognise&mdash;and I believe it has&mdash;that Queensland, historically, has been disadvantaged regarding university places. As people move from the rust belt areas of southern Australia to places like the Sunshine Coast, it is important that university places go with them. It is quite unfair that thousands of students in Queensland are simply unable to obtain a place in a tertiary institution whereas, in southern states, many of the universities are struggling to fill their existing quotas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am confident that the minister, when making her contribution to plug Beazley's black hole, will ensure that Queensland is not further disadvantaged. We were ignored for many of the 13 years of Labor government and it is about time that that historic inequity was addressed. I am confident that this will indeed occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As we move into the next century, the Sunshine Coast University College will be one of Australia's major tertiary institutions. The staff is of very high quality. The students are diverse and able. They come from, principally, the Sunshine Coast and also other parts of the state and nation. I wish this important institution well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) has raised the question of university places for the state of Queensland this afternoon. But I would have been more pleased had he referred in passing to the potential loss of a university in Queensland, namely, the campus at Ipswich which I had an opportunity to visit last week. I would have thought that he, with his very close friend the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), ought to be raising this important issue in the House so as to ensure that the commitment given by the previous government to establish a university at Ipswich is delivered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The issue I seek to raise this afternoon is rather timely in the light of last week's meeting of COAG and the serious impact Treasurer Costello's agreement with the premiers will have on ordinary PAYE taxpayers. My grievance relates to the government's failure to act against wealthy tax cheats in Australia. In the recent election campaign, the coalition paraded around the country claiming that they would not introduce any new taxes. Mr Costello, in particular, smugly claimed this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election the ALP announced a plan to raise $800 million from 100 of the wealthiest tax avoiders in Australia, many of whom are friends of the government. The unfortunate situation is that the lot on the other side of the chamber did not like that, but they were shamed at that time into saying that they would also match the commitment given by the Labor government of the day. But not now&mdash;oh, no, it's too difficult. The government wants to let them get away with it, just like they did in the bottom of the harbour days when the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1987"> The government in which John Howard was Treasurer pursued so-called dole bludgers but was more than happy to let its tax avoiding friends rake in their ill&hyphen;gotten gains. In the same way today, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer say that it is too hard to collect the huge sums in unpaid tax from wealthy partici pants and family trusts. I think it is high time that this nation required the government to deliver on its commitment to the Australian electorate in the lead&hyphen;up to the last federal election to act, and to act decisively, on the question of tax avoidance and the existence of family trust schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is interesting to note in passing that it is not too hard to knock off the tax concessions for research and development which, as the Metal Trades Industry Association has rightly said publicly on a number of occasions, have brought great benefits to the Australian economy and are vital for the nation's future. Nor is it too hard to take a paltry tax concession off struggling building workers with respect to their travelling allowances. It is not too hard to blunder into last week's COAG conference and to try to make tax changes which would have cost 30,000 car sales and 4,000 jobs in the car industry and, at the same time, suggest that there ought to be new taxes on pencils and chalk in state schools and on babies' bottles in public hospitals. One law for the rich&mdash;the mates of those on the other side of the chamber&mdash;and one law for the poor. That is the tories' way&mdash;always has been and always will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If the Treasurer is really so concerned about the tax burden on Joe Average, why will he not do something about those tax avoiders who are well above the average? The tax commissioner, an independent public servant, has had the courage to come out and say that the former government's plans to tax family trusts can and should be proceeded with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know why some on the other side of the chamber are concerned about this issue: because of some of their mates. For example, a third of the Victorian coalition cabinet are actively involved in the existence and pursuance of tax avoidance through their family trusts. But Peter Costello naturally wants to go quiet on this issue. We on this side of the House are not going to let Peter Costello go quiet on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is happy to hit tertiary students with a huge increase in HECS, which Amanda Vanstone always called a tax but, no, not any more. This is not a tax increase now. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Dr Kemp keeps complaining about the fact that we were prepared to spend a couple of billion dollars to assist the long-term unemployed back to work, but he does not care about the much greater cost to the country, including the budget deficit, of not getting unemployment down&mdash;estimated, I might say, at $40 billion. Forty billion dollars is not chicken feed. Nor does the government care at all about getting those 100 rich tax avoiders to pay up the $800 million that they are depriving the nation of and which would go towards helping the unemployed, supporting labour market programs and creating new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people like to compare Australia's tax levels with those of our Asian neighbours rather than with other member countries of the OECD. I suggest this gives a misleading picture of us as a high tax country. Most of our Asian neighbours do not have anywhere near the welfare services or the educational opportunities which are established and politically essential to maintaining any First World nation such as Australia to ensure decent opportunities in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is much more accurate to compare us with the other members of the OECD. What this comparison shows is that in the early 1990s Australia became the lowest taxed country in the Western world. One of the main policy challenges of the 1990s and beyond will be to ensure that national governments do gain sufficient revenue to look after the many people dislocated by economic restructuring. More revenue will need to be raised. What better opportunity is there than taxing family trusts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question I pose is: how should this revenue be raised? In recent times we have again seen new calls for a goods and services tax. All I can say from the opposition's point of view is that we will never support such a regressive tax because it will inevitably hit the poor hardest. But, unlike the government, we certainly will insist and do everything to ensure that the wealthy do pay their fair share of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest in conclusion that the time has come for the government to show their true colours. Are they really concerned about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1988"> ensuring equity in the Australian taxation system? In that context are they prepared to act on their election promise and hit family trusts, instead of the milk bottles supplied for new-born babies in public hospitals? That is the real question that the government of the day ought to front up to. It is no longer acceptable to say that taking on family trusts is too difficult when, at the recent COAG conference, the Treasurer suggested that we ought to attack the automobile industry, reduce the job opportunities in places such as Geelong and South Australia, impose new taxes on public hospitals and schools and, by doing so, impose yet another tax burden on ordinary PAYE taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the need for the government to look after their mates: those who delve into and develop family trusts as a means of minimising meeting their responsibilities to the Australian community at large. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> reported only a couple of Sundays ago, one-third of the Victorian Liberal cabinet are operating family trusts. In the interests of equity in Australia, the time has come for the government to deliver on their commitment to the Australian electorate. Yes, they were forced into meeting a promise made by the Labor government of the day, to face up to closing off this loophole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is this going to be yet another broken promise? Is the government really concerned about revenue in this country, or are we returning to the bad old days of the government of the day looking after their mates in the community, lining their own pockets and ensuring that ordinary PAYE taxpayers pay more than they ought to in a society such as Australia's?</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.05 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a little bit of a heavy heart that I participate in the grievance debate this evening. I want to highlight to the House the absolute dilemma the beef industry is in at the moment. It is one of the primary industries at the centre of primary production in my electorate. I particularly want to highlight to the House the dilemma that the beef producers along the coastal section of New South Wales are in. It is easy for us to say that farmers can get into <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other pursuits and that beef producers who have a mixed farm can hop into crop production or into fat lambs, but the beef producers along that part of the coast do not have that flexibility or alternative. So they are restricted to the beef industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This dilemma has been brought to my attention obviously by a number of my constituents. Importantly, I recently read in a paper a letter to the editor from Mr Jim Henderson of Gloucester. I wish to read some extracts of that because it highlights the seriousness of the problem. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two years ago a 370kg grass-fed Jap Ox carcass was worth $980. Today it is worth $460. A large proportion of the $1.30 per kg drop to producers can be attributed to the increased value of the Australian dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While returns to producers have dropped by half, production costs from items such as rates, fuel, seed, fertiliser, drench etc. have all increased in price. During the same period, producers have battled one of the worst droughts on record, and farm debt has gone up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public would understand the rural crisis better if they compared it with, for instance, the halving of the value of BHP shares, or the basic wage or the dole. If you relate the same drop in value across the beef industry&mdash;which is a reality&mdash;it means that the producer with 200 breeders has lost at least $105,000 in the value of his stock on hand. His yearly income has dropped from $60,000&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>that is, gross&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to $30,000&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>gross&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">while the running expense of the property is at least $40,000, which doesn't include any wages for himself or his family. When you add interest on the average farm debt of $200,000 one is able to get some insight into the extent of the disaster&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the disaster that has currently beset the beef industry. Jim Henderson continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rural Australia put faith in the change of government to give it back some hope of prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farmers don't appreciate being made the peasants of society while they are producing food and export dollars for the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What really annoys beef producers is the bad publicity their industry receives, which impacts on consumer confidence. Also the fact that retail prices don't mirror returns to producers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just one example of the deep anxiety and concern that is being felt within the beef <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1989"> industry, particularly along coastal New South Wales. Henderson said that with the change of government they expected some action. The government is taking action with some of the basic structures which affect some of those problems facing the beef industry at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at some of the statistics on beef prices and market share we will see that current beef prices have fallen 40 per cent on average since December 1995. Prices are the lowest in actual dollar terms since 1982&hyphen;83. Prices in real terms&mdash;minus inflation&mdash;are equal to the lowest prices ever received for beef; that is, going back to 1975 at the height of the beef crash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been significant loss in Australia's market share in a number of key export markets. The following figures are quite compelling. In 1994 we had 53 per cent of the market in Japan; in 1996 we have 45 per cent. In 1994 we had 43 per cent of the market in Korea; in 1996 we have 27 per cent. In 1994 we had 70 per cent of the market in Taiwan; today we have 50 per cent. Much of that market share has been lost to the USA and New Zealand. The US share of the Japanese market has gone from 43 per cent to 50 per cent. New Zealand is about to overtake Australia in terms of market share in Korea. Some of the causes of the dilemma in the beef industry at the moment are the US beef oversupply, the increase in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost disadvantages facing the Australian beef industry; that is, processing costs and industrial relations&mdash;waterfront reform, transport and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the areas that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and the government have taken steps to address is AMLC promotions. Over the past three or four years there has been a steady decline in funding for the whole range of AMLC programs, including the Japanese market promotional program. This has been due to a cut in processor levies since March 1993. This has been using up a lot of the AMLC cash reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overall AMLC budget for the Japanese promotional exercise has fallen from $26 million in 1994&hyphen;95 to $20 million in 1995&hyphen;96. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Let us compare that with the budget that is being expended in the growing marketplaces. In 1994&hyphen;95 in South&hyphen;East Asia&mdash;that excludes Korea, Japan and China&mdash;the budget was only $1 million. Only $1 million was spent on promotion in that area, when developing nations like Indonesia and the Philippines are looking for live cattle exports&mdash;and sheep exports as well. At the same time, $23 million is being spent on promotion in the domestic market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has established the meat industry review task force which is reviewing the activities of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Meat Research Council. The task force is looking at three key areas and is going to report back to the minister on all options for reform of the meat industry. It will be reviewing the performance of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Meat Research Council. It is going to recommend to the minister a number of specific areas in which the government can take immediate action so that we can try to address some of the problems that have beset the beef industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a personal perspective, I would hope that that review is also going to look at the structure of the AMLC. In other areas of primary production, for instance wool and wheat, we have individual entities promoting individual products. Within the gamut of the AMLC there are probably four product areas: beef, sheep meat, live sheep and live cattle. I do not believe they should all be lumped together. There are conflicting interests in those four areas and they should be separated. I am hopeful that the review that is being undertaken into the AMLC and the Meat Research Council, on behalf of the government, will address that very issue of what I perceive as a conflict of interest between those competing sectors of the meat production and processing industries in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly hope this review will result in the AMLC being more flexible and accountable. The beef industry expects and deserves better value for its dollar as far as promotion is concerned. I do not believe it is getting value for dollar. Hopefully this review will ensure that the levies the producers pay in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1990"> marketplace&mdash;they go straight to the AMLC for promotion of their product&mdash;are better and more efficiently spent. It is very important that we see that brought to fruition. I look forward to the report from that task force coming to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have grappled for a lot of years with a marketing and grading system for the beef industry in this country but within this industry, as in a lot of other rural industries, it is difficult to get consensus on grading. It seems that, before we can get consensus, we have to get to the stage where the demise of the industry is imminent. That is a sad situation and a sad indictment of a lot of the players within the production and processing parts of the industry. It is high time we got a universal grading system across the spectrum in the beef industry, one that is recognised domestically and internationally, so we get faith in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that the grading system should be an objective measurement using criteria such as age, muscle or marbling, fat cover and meat colour. Feeding regime&mdash;that is, grass fed or grain fed&mdash;should not be a grading criterion. It is a description in the marketplace, not a grading criterion. Terms like `export quality' and `A&hyphen;grade beef' should be eliminated from the beef industry vocabulary because they draw attention to one thing or another. We export all sorts of differing grades of beef, not just `export quality' beef. We have to get back to an objective grading system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most Australians are fully aware of the Snowy Mountains scheme. Most Australians know very well the famous story of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Man from Snowy River</EMPHASIS> . But, sadly, not many Australians know much about the great river which has provided the basis for these great Australian icons&mdash;that is, of course, the Snowy River itself. I have to say that it is a very sad thing that this river is, if not dying, getting very close to it. Something which should be seen as a national icon, which should be seen by Australians as a great <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environmental treasure, is being allowed to gradually deteriorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I care particularly about this issue because I was born and raised in a town called Orbost, which is almost at the mouth of the Snowy River about six or seven miles inland. The river itself exits at a place called Marlo, which is about seven miles away from Orbost. I have lived beside the river. I swam in it and fished in it as a kid. I have worked on my father's farm next to the river. On more than one occasion I have been a victim of the floods that the river has been prone to. I have seen the river in many guises over a long period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That period of my life, of course, was a fair while ago. I have been a city dweller for quite some time since then. Nonetheless, this is an issue that I still care about, and I am very pleased to see that it is finally getting some of the coverage it deserves. I became used to a river with sand islands in the middle&mdash;quite large sand islands&mdash;and a very low flow in many parts of it, particularly around Orbost. Now the situation is even worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Snowy Mountains scheme, with its resultant changes to the river, has contributed to the flow of the Snowy River being reduced to approximately one per cent of its normal flow at Jindabyne. On the Victorian side of the border it is only through the Delegate and Rodger rivers adding to the river downstream that is it kept alive at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Decisions of the day with respect to diversion of the water resources of the Snowy to feed the Snowy Mountains scheme and for irrigation and electricity generation purposes were based not on environmental considerations with respect to the downstream environment, nor indeed the broader needs of the communities in the downstream areas, but on a very narrow measurement of the needs for water of people in the Orbost and surrounding districts. Equally, other factors, such as the potential for tourism, were not even taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a substantial decline in the quality of the Snowy River both in southern New South Wales below Jindabyne and in the more southerly areas in the lower part of Victoria. The weir at Dalgety silted up in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1991"> 1993; it was covered in undergrowth, and approximately 4,000 tonnes of sand had to be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Snowy Mountains scheme sends roughly half of the flow from the Snowy River to the Murray and roughly half to the Murrumbidgee via Lake Jindabyne, Lake Eucumbene and the Tumut River. Recently, as a result of agitation and effort by people in the Orbost region, an expert panel was put together consisting of people with expertise in areas such as freshwater ecology, hydrology, and the like, to examine what needs to be done to revive the Snowy River to bring it back, if not to its original glory, at least to some sort of shadow of its original state and not let it remain in the dilapidated state in which it is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This expert panel found that there is major siltation in many areas of the river; that the intrusion of saltwater has come so far up the river that it is now past Orbost, so that is somewhere in the vicinity of seven to 10 miles upstream from the mouth of the river; that there has been a drastic reduction in the diversity of fish and macro&hyphen;invertebrates; and that the biology of the lower parts of the river now resembles a lake&mdash;and, indeed, there are substantial sections of the river near Marlo which, to the eye, look much more like a lake than a river. The expert panel also found that there is severe weed invasion and alteration of vegetation on the banks of the river. It recommended that the annual flows to the river in the Victorian areas be increased by 500 per cent; that obstacles to fish migration upstream be reduced and removed; that there be a substantial research program initiated by state and federal governments; and that there be a proper vegetation management plan implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the environmental damage that has been sustained, other effects have occurred as a result of the reduced flow of the Snowy River. There is less water for farmers in the Orbost district. There has been a reduction in the possibility of a pulp mill being established&mdash;and this has been a great goal of many in the district for many years; it is one which I have some reservations about but, if it could be an environmentally friendly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pulp mill, I would happily support it&mdash;because of the need for water for any such pulp mill. Also, of course, the prospects for tourism are reduced&mdash;not only whitewater rafting and other things that might be associated with further upstream but also tourism in the vicinity of Orbost and Marlo where there are many potential tourist attractions which are not being helped by having a river with large sand islands in its middle rather than a river with a substantial flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, there are some barriers to achieving change. One is that the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;electricity Authority is due to be corporatised in September this year. Reduced flows for the Snowy Mountains scheme would mean reduced business and reduced profits for the authority. So it is vital that these environmental issues are resolved and a proper plan put in place, first, before corporatisation is proceeded with. Secondly, water that is currently diverted to the Murray and Murrumbidgee is used for irrigation and the users are now trying to claim that they have some sort of ownership or right of resource security over that water. I doubt whether people in the Orbost district are too pleased with that sort of claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 a COAG statement was made with respect to water resources policy in which it was determined that governments would make `appropriate allocations to the environment in order to enhance and restore the health of river systems'. There would be substantial benefits to the Snowy River, its natural environment and the people of East Gippsland if the flow of the Snowy were increased to 25 per cent of the original flow, which would amount to about 800 megalitres per day. There would be some costs&mdash;a slight increase in salinity in the lower Murray, less production of electricity and, of course, less irrigation water for people relying on the Murray and the Murrumbidgee, although there would be some positive environmental benefits for the Tumut River.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation has estimated that the total cost of this proposal would be roughly $22 million, $17.5 million of which would be in lost electricity generation. However, we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1992"> should consider the long list of positive benefits for the great Snowy River&mdash;both in terms of the natural environment and the tourism and recreational potential associated with the beautiful areas that are a part of the Snowy River in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is good to see, as I mentioned at the outset, that the Snowy is finally getting some attention in the mass media. There was a very substantial article by Sue Neales in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> a couple of months ago, and I commend that article to honourable members. This issue is certainly one that people in the East Gippsland area have been well aware of for many years, but now it is starting to attract some national media attention. It has also attracted the attention of the Australian Conservation Foundation, which I am pleased to see. Policy makers are also starting to consider the consequences&mdash;both the indirect and the perhaps unforeseen consequences&mdash;of the Snowy Mountains scheme for people in areas like East Gippsland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is great to see that at last the voices of the people in the East Gippsland area are being heard. It is a fairly lightly populated region. As I indicated, the decisions which were made with respect to the flow of the Snowy many years ago were based purely on the notional water needs of what was then a very small population, without considering some of the important, broader implications for the natural environment and the other potential water resource uses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would call on the Victorian state government, the New South Wales state government and the Commonwealth government&mdash;potentially in a coordinating role, but with greater emphasis on the Victorian government&mdash;to start treating this issue seriously and to start developing a management strategy to ensure that the Snowy River can flow properly again, that the terrible depredation of the river that has occurred as a result of the Snowy Mountains scheme can at least partly be reversed and that a longstanding injustice can be reversed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the honourable member for Gippsland, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran), will join me in pursuing this on a bipartisan basis. I also hope <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that other members of this House will, in some way, contribute to making sure that what should be a great national icon&mdash;and which, indeed, is the basis of at least two major icons; that is, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Man from Snowy River</EMPHASIS> story and the Snowy Mountains scheme&mdash;can at last be returned to something akin to its original state and flow as a great, free river again.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this grievance debate to report to the House on a couple of the viewpoints of people in the electorate of Moreton on the issue of gun laws, an issue which has been occupying the minds and hearts of so many in this place of late. I wish to state for the record that I am strongly in favour of the procedure of uniformity of gun laws in this country and I support what has been proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also state that it would not normally be my practice to have us regulate and legislate against those who are law-abiding citizens; rather, we should seek to punish those who do the wrong thing. They are words similar to the expression of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he first spoke to the House about this matter some months ago. I also think my viewpoint is somewhat consistent with what I told gun lobbyists in my electorate before the election. I told them very simply that legitimate, law-abiding gun owners had nothing to fear under a coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly time now to deal with the facts and not the folklore. I am sure&mdash;as you would realise, Madam Deputy Speaker&mdash;that there is a great deal of folklore floating around in the community. I welcome the initiative of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and the Prime Minister to advertise over the next couple of weeks and state clearly just what the new proposed laws are. I believe those laws which have been adopted by the states and territories will be well received by the vast majority of Australians&mdash;even some of those who are currently protesting&mdash;once they know what the facts are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is certainly a lot of nonsense being peddled. To be frank, this issue is occupying <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1993"> far too much of all of our time at the moment, as we are trying to settle down those who are dishing up so many of these nonsensical claims. It is sad to note that even members of this House are amongst those who are peddling some of the absolutely arrant nonsense. So we need to get the facts out there in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It disturbs me right off the top to note that some people believe the new laws which have been offered, suggested and adopted by the states mean that there is going to be a total ban of guns in Australia. It certainly disturbs me to see average Australians believe their constitutional rights are suddenly being threatened because they believe they once had a constitutional right to carry a weapon. I do not see this anywhere in our constitution, but a lot of people clearly believe that it is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people also firmly believe they will no longer be able to defend themselves if someone should attack them. Again, this is arrant nonsense. So many of these people who are perpetuating these myths and folklore around the ridges&mdash;and thereby frightening average Australians who have probably not thought about gun laws to any great extent&mdash;are doing no justice to themselves as Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it quite sad to see so many law-abiding, decent Australians who have always maintained a great belief in democracy&mdash;the rule of the majority&mdash;are now openly discussing ways to blatantly break new laws, simply because they find themselves in a minority. These people call this civil disobedience, but it will do nothing to advance their argument. As I said, they are doing absolutely no justice to themselves and they will only continue to frighten more and more Australians who do not want to see semiautomatic and automatic weapons so widely available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Let me state again for the record the groups of people who will have a genuine reason for possessing or using a firearm. They will include sporting shooters who use lawful firearms and have a valid membership of an approved club; recreational shooters and hunters who produce proof of permission from a public or private landowner; people with an occupational requirement&mdash;for exam ple, primary producers, other rural workers, security employees and professional shooters for nominated purposes; bona fide collectors of firearms; and people with other limited purposes which are authorised by legislation. This would include firearms which are used in film productions and those sorts of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very important people also understand a de facto prohibited persons register will be operating, so people who should never legally own a firearm will not be able to. Only fit and proper people are going to be able to legally own a weapon. In this regard, criminals, those with an established mental disorder and even those who have perpetuated horrible things like domestic violence will never be able to obtain a gun legally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It disturbs me that I get from people in my electorate comments such as this&mdash;and I will not name the writer; I will quote part of the letter for the record:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">So that you cannot claim ignorance of the facts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we firearm owners have fulfilled a most rigorous police check second only to that for a J.P. to qualify for a firearm licence.

<PARA>On it goes. I would like to offer a contrast to let you know the majority of people in the electorate of Moreton wholeheartedly support the efforts of the Prime Minister and the cooperation of the states in this matter. A few weeks ago I wrote to schools in my electorate and invited them to talk to their students and see whether they wanted to send some thoughts and messages to the people of Port Arthur. Both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) stated quite clearly that none of us should allow the people of Port Arthur to feel as though they have been forgotten by the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say many schools in my electorate responded. Later this week, I will be presenting to the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), the member who represents the people of Port Arthur, a booklet which he can take back to the people of Port Arthur showing some of the thoughts of the people in the electorate of Moreton. For the record, I would like to quote some of them now. The students of year 6 at Wellers Hill State School wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have you ever seen Port Arthur? Buildings crumbling, historical memorials, tourists sight&hyphen;seeing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have you ever heard of Wellers Hill? Community shocked, children sympathizing, feeling compassion.</PARA>
<PARA>The year 7 students of Greenslopes State School wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are glad that the government is doing something about gun laws in our country. Hopefully when these laws are set, things will change for the better.</PARA>
<PARA>The year 1 students at Salisbury State School have drawn some wonderful pictures of themselves. I guess the sentiments at the bottom of the page were written by their teacher, Mrs Rogers. They read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are sorry about the bad man, the horrible guns, the sad families and the work people and the businesses. Please be happy again.</PARA>
<PARA>Amanda Staples from Yeronga State School wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very sorry for what has happened. I never thought anything like that would happen. I hope some of these letters will make you feel better.

<PARA>I thank the students of those schools for their contributions to this booklet, which I will give to the member for Lyons and ask him to take to the people of Port Arthur. I was pleased to see that my old high school, Macgregor, contributed some nice artwork for the booklet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I say again that the great majority of the constituents of Moreton are certainly behind the tightening of gun laws and support the leadership which the Prime Minister has shown. We certainly do not want to live in a wild west kind of world which some people, even in this place, seem to want to promote. We know the new laws will not offer the guarantees which we would all like, but if we as parliamentarians had not tried to go down this path then I think we would have failed the great majority of people in this country. I call on those who class themselves as law&hyphen;abiding Australians, gun owners, who may or may not be affected by the facts which underlie the laws, not the folklore, to accept the majority rule on this&mdash;to obey the laws and not to break them.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use the limited time available to me <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1995"> in the grievance debate to highlight the result of many of the decisions taken in the first three months of this government and those that are likely to be announced in the August budget. Many of these decisions are having very adverse effects on people in rural Australia. The latest decision, which was made only last Thursday, was to revoke exceptional circumstances criteria for many rural areas in Australia, including areas in my own electorate such as Scone, Denman and Singleton. This decision will have a devastating effect on my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many members will be aware that my father was the member for Hunter up until March this year. I have to say that 1995 was a difficult year for the former member. Notwithstanding the obvious effects of drought in many areas of the Upper Hunter, RASAC, the body charged with making recommendations to the minister regarding the designation of exceptional circumstances areas, continued to deny many areas of my electorate drought assistance. I understand that RASAC considers meteorological, agronomic, economic and environmental conditions when assessing an area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, and thankfully, by the end of last year most areas in my electorate were granted exceptional circumstances classification. The former member suffered a great deal of criticism between the period when classifications first began to be handed out and when his electorate received assistance. The plight of the farmers was obvious, but the best the former member could do was turn to the recommendations of RASAC, the technical body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real pain came from the cries of the then opposition members in the Hunter and nearby. One of those screaming at that time is now the minister responsible! What has the minister, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), now done? After months and months of pain and suffering and continual fighting to have those areas designated so that people in the Upper Hunter can receive drought relief assistance, the minister has now revoked the classification. Why? On the advice of RASAC. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I say another word, I want to assure the House that the Upper Hunter is still very much in drought. I will not ask honourable members to take my word; rather, I will quote from the front page of an Upper Hunter newspaper, dated 3 June 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Almost all of the Upper Hunter remains drought declared as farmers start to prepare for the added burden of winter and its usual slow growth conditions. The entire Scone and Merriwa rural lands protection districts had been included on the drought declaration list for June. Parts of the Denman and Singleton rural lands protection district are also on the drought list.</PARA>
<PARA>The Merriwa rural lands protection board protection spokesman, Kevin O'Malley, said that the start of winter frosts already was short&hyphen;circuiting any benefit last month's rain might have had on encouraging pasture growth in his area. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a very short green tinge in the paddocks and people are continuing to hand feed and supplementary feed.</PARA>
<PARA>The situation, according to the paper, is similar to that in the Singleton&hyphen;Denman area, where farmers are facing the problem of not only not having the money to buy grain to feed their cattle but also not wanting to sell them in a market which is so depressed. In the Scone rural lands protection board area, veterinarian John Entwistle tells us that the drought is still having a very strong effect. Let me share with the House what the member for Gwydir had to say on 29 March last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My heart really goes out to those people in central New South Wales in areas such as Dubbo; Wellington and Mudgee, in my own electorate; Merriwa in the electorate of Hunter . . . and further down to Scone, where horrendous financial and personal problems are arising out of the drought. They are ruled ineligible because of a rigid set of rules, a narrow set of criteria. What is at fault? It can only be the criteria. Why is there not a willingness to do that which, as I have said, I am sure the Australian people not only expect will be done but no doubt believe is being done to meet those welfare and educational needs of those families in real crisis?</PARA>
<PARA>Now it seems that the recommendations of RASAC are sacrosanct. In June 1995 Senator John Tierney moved a private member's motion in the Senate on drought relief. It states: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1996">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) condemns the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) for his `boneheaded' decision to accept the recommendations of the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Committee, which has continued to exclude partial areas of the Upper Hunter region from the exceptional circumstances drought aid package.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) highlights the anger of the entire Upper Hunter region at this arbitrary decision which has produced two classes of drought&hyphen;ravaged farm families with the anomaly that the excluded areas are as badly drought&hyphen;affected as the areas included on the list.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) demands that the Minister explain forthwith to the Senate why this unbelievable bureaucratic anomaly has occurred, placing incredible stresses and anxiety on farmers whose last hopes rested with inclusion in the exceptional circumstances list.</PARA>
<PARA>This is absolutely extraordinary stuff. This is the ultimate in hypocrisy coming from members on the other side. Senator Sandy Macdonald, speaking again on RASAC on 29 November 1995, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am concerned by the secrecy surrounding RASAC's advice to the government. I believe the information upon which the minister bases his submissions to the cabinet must be made public to allow the more intense scrutiny that is essential. We have been told that, in formulating advice, RASAC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he goes through all the criteria used. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My concern lies in the interpretation of the advice by the government. After all, they are the government. They are there to provide help. Help must be provided by them.</PARA>
<PARA>Where is the member for Gwydir? Where is Senator Tierney? Where is Senator Sandy Macdonald now? Their silence is deafening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to revoke exceptional circumstances criteria will be devastating for people in the Upper Hunter. Honourable members of the National Party know it, yet they say nothing about it. But, worse than that, not only have they been silent when requesting further information about how RASAC comes to make its decisions but also I understand that the process adopted this time around has been less than satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Originally, the rural lands protection boards in the Upper Hunter were invited to make <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> submissions to RASAC, but not this time. This time, the Upper Hunter delegates were invited to places as far away as Tamworth and Coonabarabran to state their cases. They were given very short notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tierney, in his speech of 29 March 1995, gives examples of those who will be adversely affected by the denial by RASAC, and by implication the former government, of exceptional circumstances criteria. Before the drought a beef farmer had nil debt. But, because of the denial of government assistance and the drought, he is now $150,000 in debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tierney wants to suggest now, I assume&mdash;just 12 months later and with beef prices so depressed&mdash;that this gentleman no longer needs assistance. I suspect that the invitation to the National Party to become a partner in government was a token gesture only. I can only assume that to be the case, because it is obvious to me and it must be obvious to all members of this House that the voice of the National Party is not being heard in cabinet. The National Party members can do one of two things: they can start to stand up for rural and regional Australia and represent the people they purport naturally to represent or they can do the honourable thing and get out of government entirely. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak in this debate about the firearm law reform proposals, but I am prompted to do so for two reasons. I listened with interest to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) in his contribution to this debate and I agree entirely with what he had to say&mdash;it is my experience&mdash;but I am prompted to make some brief comments because I have just had a note passed to me in the chamber which says, `Please come up to the office as soon as possible as there has been a bomb threat at Clifford Gardens shopping centre in Toowoomba and the caller has associated himself with the gun lobby people.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As somebody who has been subjected to electoral threat and physical threat over the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1997"> last 10 days, I take exception to this. I apologise for my emotional outburst, but I think it is something that goes to the heart of the problem. What concerns me is that here is a Prime Minister (Mr Howard), with the strong support of both sides of the House, exercising some national leadership and, in doing so, he has taken up the challenge of some of the fringe dwellers. What concerns me about this whole debate is the fact that it is not about responsible gun ownership at all; it is about the generation of what I would term a militia culture. It is about time that some of these fringe dwellers and the `looney tunes', as I refer to them, stood up and really showed themselves for what they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Moreton made a very valid comment about the degree to which it is the silent majority that should count in this debate and not the vociferous empty vessels that make up some of the minority views. That is not to criticise the thousands of responsible gun owners and shooters&mdash;sporting shooters in particular&mdash;around the country. What it does is highlight the fact that there is a small group in our community at the moment which are attempting to hijack this debate for their own ends. There are a number of people out there who would have us indulge in something that this nation does not want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an example, I had two meetings in my electorate last week involving over a thousand people, and I have to say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to members in the chamber that the vast majority of the people who were at those meetings were against me because I was seen as a conduit to what the Prime Minister was standing up for in this very strong debate. After one of the meetings I was physically threatened and told, `We would like to shoot you, Mr Taylor.' I take exception to that sort of comment, even perhaps made as flippantly as it might have been made. I took it very seriously and I continue to take it very seriously. I take it seriously not just for me, but for my wife, who is at home and, of course, unable to defend herself. I would hope that those extremists out there will take on board what is a very difficult situation for all of us in this place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give you an extreme example, last Wednesday evening there was a meeting in Toowoomba involving something like 700 or 800 people from outside my electorate; a lot of these people are being bussed and driven in to beat the whole thing up. A gentleman who was obviously at the meeting faxed a message to me on Friday, and this is the sort of extreme view with which we are faced. He wanted to know whether I was a constitutionalist, whether I was a federalist or whether I was an internationalist. He wanted to know because he wanted to make up his mind whether I was a fool, whether I was a liar or whether I was a traitor. I very quickly replied to him in a letter which I hope he has received today, and I hope he understands what I had to say. I made the point to him that I am none of those things: I would hope I am not a fool, I am certainly not a liar and I most certainly am not a traitor. What I am is an Australian who is very proud to stand up to people like this; people who, if they had their way, would inject a degree of anarchy into this country which we cannot afford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in the United States last year when the situation in Oklahoma City occurred and I watched that particular occurrence in living colour. Some of these people think they have a right to have firearms. I have said to some of these people, `How can you have a right taken away from you that you haven't got?' They can go back to 1688, they can go back to Magna Carta, they can do as they want to; but there is no constitutional right in this country to own and to use firearms. I say to them that we have had enough of this militia culture, we have had enough of the international conspiracy and we have had enough of their nonsense as they tend to rabblerouse in some of these meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the Prime Minister will continue to do what he did yesterday in Sale. I hope he will come to Toowoomba and I hope he will talk to thousands of people and tell them as it really is. I repeat that this whole issue is not about responsible gun ownership; it is all about a few who want to gee&hyphen;up the situation simply for their own means and inject a degree of anarchy in this country which we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1998"> cannot afford. I hope everybody in this House agrees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other dimension to it. Whilst some of them out there, the fringe dwellers, continue to generate this sort of environment, there are a number in this parliament who have indicated that this has the potential for violence. Those in this parliament who suggest that and who go out and actively get involved with some of these groups do us and the nation a great disservice. They exacerbate what is already a very difficult situation physically and otherwise for everybody in this House and for people right around the country. I did not intend to speak on this subject; I was going to speak on something quite different in terms of treaty processes, but having listened to the member for Moreton and having been passed a note, I felt duty bound to say that. I hope that everybody in the House agrees with me.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate at the outset that the opposition, without reservation, supports both the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1996 and the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1996 as part of the Commonwealth's response to the horrific events at Port Arthur. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his second reading speech said that this tragedy has concentrated attention on the fact that there are large holdings of types of rapid fire weapons in our community which is simply not justifiable in the overall national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that all state governments are acting on this matter and that there is overwhelming cross&hyphen;party support for the implementation of what the government is doing. That is as it should be because this transcends party politics. Sadly, there is not a unanimous point of view on this issue across the country. Some members of parliament hold strong views that do not accord with the view of the overwhelming majority of parliamentarians. Everyone is entitled to their point of view. We should not be frightened to debate matters. But we should not have threats made to either side that hold different points of view. That is not the Australian way; that is not the way we do these things. I understand that some people who have a different view from me hold that view legitimately and honestly. But for the life of me I cannot see the need for these weapons in the community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe in the right to bear arms. I believe that it is a limited right. It is a right which should be exercised by the armed forces, the military forces, the police and in other limited instances. The best estimate at the moment is that it will cost around $500 million to buy back these weapons. Certainly, that is a very large cost. It is through a one&hyphen;off increase of 0.2 per cent in the Medicare levy that these bills will raise the necessary funds to reimburse states and territories for the direct cost of payments that they will have to make to relevant gun owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill makes consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1936 on the payment of a proportion of the full Medicare levy equivalent to a rate of 0.2 per cent by defence personnel and their relatives or associates who are currently exempt from the Medicare levy. So, basically, all sections of the community are involved in this levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only a one&hyphen;year impost. The government can be confident that we in the opposition will not in any way attempt to score political points on this levy. This is a right and just way of sharing the burden of the buyback. It is a small price for us as a community to pay to have some of these weapons taken out of our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disturbing that there is a lot of misinformation in the community about what the government is doing and the consequences of its legislation. All I say to people is: if you require information on the buybacks then contact your local member of parliament. Don't act on misinformation. The tragedy is that some people in the community are playing on people's fears and prejudices and are using this to stir up hatred and antagonism to what the government is doing. It is very easy to take easy political decisions. This is not an easy political decision for some members of the government and, indeed, for some members of the opposition because of the nature of their electorates. Those particular members are to be applauded for taking the courageous view and supporting what the government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister in his conduct to date and the Attorney&hyphen;General and the Minister for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2000"> Justice (Mr Williams) have been exemplary. I said that in an earlier comment when I was speaking to a matter of public importance on this issue back on 9 May 1996 and I repeat that statement today. I think their conduct has been exemplary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the Prime Minister feeling the need to confront his detractors on this. I saw the television footage where he spoke to those people at Sale. One has to admire the Prime Minister for basically being prepared to go into the lion's den and face his detractors. But there is a limit as to how often you need to go into the lion's den. Frankly, I do not believe that the Prime Minister needs to. That is not to say that he should not explain his position. But we on this side of the House applaud him for doing it. We say that he does not have to do it repetitively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, I think the arguments for what the Attorney&hyphen;General, who is now at the table, and the Prime Minister are doing are overwhelming. They are turning Australia into a safer place. There are people like me who believe we should go further, but this is not the time and place for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while quoting some statistics. We are mourning the tragedy of what happened in our Defence Force recently, where 18 young lives were lost. In 1994, in Australia there were 522 gun deaths. They were dominated, basically, by suicides and domestic killings. That is an enormous number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government through this buyback, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, is helping to take out these unnecessary weapons in our society. For the life of me I cannot see how anyone could sustain an argument that the weapons we are attempting to buy back are required for self-defence or are required to eliminate vermin on farm properties or whatever. You just have to look at the weapons. They are not necessary. There are other weapons. There are other methods of self-defence and other methods of eradicating vermin. In my view, the military could be brought in to eradicate vermin from farms in the outback.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But all that aside, I do not propose to take my full 30 minutes. There is no need to. Just <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because the time is allotted, it does not mean that we as members of parliament need to speak for 30 minutes. The message is simple: the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Labor Party are totally supportive of what the government is doing in relation to this legislation. It is equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition has indicated to me that he will be speaking later in the debate this evening after 8 o'clock to lend support in his own way to this proposal. I think the argument is simple: the government is on the right track, and we applaud it for that. I commend the amendment bills to the parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I offer my comments, can I express my appreciation for the support of the opposition, as expressed by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), for what the government is seeking to do. We have had support from the opposition right from the beginning. It has been invaluable in achieving a community consensus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill is to establish a mechanism for raising funds to allow the Commonwealth to compensate state and territory governments for the buyback of prohibited firearms. This bill provides the financial underpinning for the compensation proposal in the resolutions for effective nationwide controls on firearms made by all state and territory governments at the special meeting of the Australasian Police Ministers Council on 10 May this year. I remind members of the history of that agreement, an agreement to help make Australia a safer place. But first can I also refer to some statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to figures provided by the Australian Institute of Criminology from its national homicide monitoring program, for the four-year period from July 1989 to June 1993 there were 1,267 homicides in Australia. Firearms were used in almost one-quarter of these homicides. Just under one-third of the homicides were inflicted by one family member on another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just under one half of all female victims of homicides in the period studied were killed as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2001"> a result of a dispute with an intimate partner. One-third of all these deaths were caused by firearms. One-third of all firearm incidents during the four-year period involved multiple victims. There were 36 firearm incidents involving two victims, 16 involving three victims and 18 incidents involving more than three victims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics which the member for Banks mentioned show that in a single year, 1994, there were 522 firearm related deaths. Tragically, 420 of these deaths were suicide, 95 per cent of which involved men. For various reasons these have been hidden statistics. What has attracted more media attention is the number of occasions in the last 10 years in Australia in which lone gunmen with high&hyphen;powered firearms have killed many innocent people at one time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, regardless of the circumstances of gun related deaths and injuries, the Commonwealth has not been able to pass legislation to combat this problem because it does not have the constitutional power to make laws in relation to firearms. A change in gun laws requires the agreement of all the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the appalling tragedy at Port Arthur on 28 April, public outrage gave way to a nationwide community will to reform firearm laws. There is overwhelming support throughout Australia, in rural as well as urban areas, for tighter gun controls nationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immediately following the Port Arthur tragedy, I convened a special meeting of the Australasian Police Ministers Council to which I took a detailed proposal for removing high&hyphen;powered guns from the community and controlling rigorously the licensing, ownership and use of all remaining firearms. The proposal put by the Commonwealth at the meeting, after some minor changes, was convincingly endorsed by the state and territory governments in the form of a set of unanimous resolutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth acted quickly in the areas in which it had constitutional power. For example, in relation to the importation of dangerous firearms. By the time the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) opened the special <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> meeting of police ministers on 10 May, the Commonwealth was able to say it had made progress towards reviewing and tightening customs controls. The Commonwealth then amended the customs prohibited import regulations to ban completely the importation of military&hyphen;style self&hyphen;loading rifles and ammunition for such rifles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments were drafted and put in place within four days of the police ministers' meeting. The regulations were later revised further in order to clear up a number of longstanding anomalies and to tighten and add consistency to import controls on firearms of all types.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been much public discussion of the council's resolutions in the weeks following the meeting. Some of the comments aired in the media are ill&hyphen;informed and have been misleading. The government will continue to ensure that the gun control resolutions are explained and clarified. We will not resile from the resolutions made on 10 May and will assist states and territories to implement them. That is what the Australian people expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resolutions were made by all the governments of Australia. It was agreed that all states and territories would legislate to place much stronger controls on the availability of firearms, especially high&hyphen;powered weapons. The new laws will also regulate more closely the availability of firearm licences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fully automatic weapons have no place in civilian society and are to be banned. Military&hyphen;style semiautomatic weapons and those with similar capabilities are to be prohibited except for official purposes. This refers to the activities of the military and the police, and to use by professional shooters in a limited range of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Included with this category are semiautomatic rim&hyphen;fire rifles and semiautomatic and pump action shotguns whose magazine capacity exceeds a fixed limit&mdash;10 rounds in the case of rifles and five rounds in the case of the shotgun. Semiautomatic rim&hyphen;fire rifles and semiautomatic or pump action shotguns whose magazine capacity is below the fixed limit will be available for official purposes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2002"> and professional shooters. They will also be available to primary producers who are able to establish that they need that type of gun on their farm to perform a function which cannot be performed by a gun of lower power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next category includes various types of the more powerful centre&hyphen;fire rifles, but restricted to single shot or repeating action. In this category, the shooter may need to establish not only a reason for owning such a firearm but also a genuine need for that particular type of firearm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first category of long arm firearms includes single shot rim&hyphen;fire rifles, the most common type being the low powered and widely available .22. This category also includes single&hyphen; and double&hyphen;barrelled shotguns. These will be available to a shooter who can demonstrate to state or territory licensing authorities that he or she has a genuine reason to own or use such a firearm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there is the hand guns category, which includes air pistols. These have always been subject to tight controls in Australia and will continue to be controlled in this way. The police ministers did not alter the restriction on the ownership and use of hand guns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, shooters throughout Australia will continue to own and use firearms, provided they can demonstrate a reason, one or more of a need or an occupational requirement, depending upon which category of firearm they seek. In many cases, gun owners will still qualify to use a firearm but will qualify only for a lower powered or less dangerous firearm than that to which they are accustomed. The Australian governments are of the view that this will not prevent shooters from hunting or practising their sport. Many experienced shooters, particularly those involved in primary production, have written to the Prime Minister and to me to say that the single shot or repeating action rifle or shotgun is their firearm of choice and that they can see no need for anything more powerful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gun controls, however restrictive, will not provide a guarantee that massacres involving the use of guns will never happen again. The agreed gun controls will, however, by reducing the availability of military style assault <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rifles and high&hyphen;powered, high capacity semiautomatic weapons in the community, reduce the likelihood of such tragedies occurring. The agreed controls also achieve a balance between eliminating vast numbers of unnecessary guns in the community and allowing responsible farmers, hunters and sporting shooters to use a gun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second initiative in the package agreed to on 10 May 1996 is a register of firearms in every state and territory, linking the identifying details of every gun with every licensed owner across the country. Each jurisdiction will have access to each other's register through the police reference system, so that checks can be made on individual firearms as well as individual owners from one state to another. This measure will enhance greatly the safety of the public at large as well as that of police officers attending crime scenes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to a firearms register, a system of permits will be introduced in every jurisdiction, whereby a person applying to acquire a firearm must seek fresh approval from the licensing authority for each acquisition. A waiting period will be imposed on each application, during which time authorities will examine the firearms register to confirm that the applicant is still a fit and proper person to possess a licence, and to find out how many other firearms he or she holds. However, this new permit system will not prevent an existing owner from acquiring further firearms. What it is intended to do is to place the onus upon that individual to prove that he or she has a reason for acquiring another firearm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One advantage of the new licensing arrangements is that there will be more consistency from one jurisdiction to another, both in the licensing standards and in the grounds upon which licences can be refused, cancelled or seized. This will benefit both the individual shooter moving between jurisdictions and the authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Safety training levels will be improved and standardised, as will minimum levels of security and storage for firearms. Sales of firearms, including mail&hyphen;order sales, will be tightened up considerably. Each jurisdiction will legislate to ban all firearms sales unless conducted through a licensed firearms dealer. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2003"> However, in order to avoid disadvantaging people living in remote areas of Australia, individual governments may need to put special arrangements in place to accommodate such people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the new controls can work only if the owners of those firearms which have been prohibited under the new legislation surrender their guns. There will be a 12&hyphen;month amnesty, which will be given wide publicity at both national and state and territory levels, during which prohibited and unwanted guns can be surrendered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The distinguishing feature of the amnesty agreed to by the police ministers is that the Commonwealth government has undertaken to encourage gun owners to comply by offering a major financial incentive to surrender their guns. The Commonwealth will provide, through state and territory governments, a fair and proper price for all prohibited firearms which have been surrendered by their owners. Many may wish to use their compensation money to buy a firearm of a non-prohibited type.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the compensation scheme, all governments have agreed to legislate to provide for severe penalties for breaches of the new legislation, particularly breaches involving prohibited, high&hyphen;powered weapons. The number of firearms affected by these prohibitions is difficult to determine but it is certainly in the hundreds of thousands. Any scheme to draw these weapons out of the community and to compensate the owners for their reasonable value is likely to be a major undertaking. It is an undertaking that the overwhelming majority of Australians want to see both started and implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An expert group of officials has been established to develop standard guidelines and procedures to be implemented in each jurisdiction for receiving, valuing and disposing of prohibited firearms surrendered by their owners, and for compensating owners and firearms dealers. Much work has already been done and the details of the compensation scheme are now being finalised by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is intended that the procedure for surrendering firearms will be simple and that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> price paid by the government will be fair and proper. It is intended that the great majority of firearms handed in will be valued, regardless of condition, according to a list of the most common firearms in the community. It is hoped in this way to avoid lengthy disputes regarding the value of individual weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulties facing firearms dealers have been given special attention by the expert group. I anticipate that most dealers will be satisfied with the approach the government intends to take. A separate working party has been established to give special attention to how collections of firearms of historical or curio value can be most appropriately dealt with. I am expecting this group to report to me in a matter of days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further working parties of officials have been formed to address other issues of detail. There is a group examining model firearms legislation which will then be considered by all state and territory governments. Another group is looking at appropriate national safety training standards for gun owners and users. A further working group is studying ways of assessing the mental and physical fitness of individuals to hold firearms licences as well as methods by which the assessments could be administered in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of these working groups has completed its work and has assisted New South Wales in finalising draft legislation which should shortly be introduced in the parliament in that state. I have advised the New South Wales Minister for Police of my support for this legislation. All other jurisdictions have reported that they are well advanced in amending their existing legislation along the lines of the New South Wales bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation in individual states and territories will not necessarily be identical. However, all have agreed to meet the minimum conditions in the resolutions of the Police Ministers Council. I expect that the necessary legislation will have been passed in all jurisdictions by the end of September this year. The mental and physical fitness issue is one which will require detailed consideration. The working group is being chaired by the Tasmanian Police Commissioner, Mr John Johnson, and will work closely with health <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2004"> officials and representatives of the medical profession. My colleagues the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) are also considering this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill addresses the funding aspect of the initiative and is the key to its successful operation. The Commonwealth has already agreed to contribute to a public education program which will accompany the 12&hyphen;month amnesty on prohibited firearms. This campaign is needed to inform the public of the changes to the law in all parts of Australia and to explain that there will be an amnesty during which they will receive fair and proper payment for all prohibited firearms surrendered under this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The campaign will operate through television, newspapers and radio as well as notices in firearms publications and at police stations. The Commonwealth has also agreed to provide funds towards the cost of developing a firearm safety training package which is standardised and accredited nationally. The proposed amendments to the Medicare levy will raise $500 million to reimburse states and territories for buying back surrendered weapons. As the Prime Minister has previously indicated, the raising of the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent is a one-off measure, and the levy will be returned to its present level of 1.5 per cent for the 1997-98 financial year and subsequent financial years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary responsibility of any government is to ensure the safety and security of its people. The gun control reforms are an initiative by the Howard government for the personal protection of all Australians. By funding the buyback scheme, this bill will assist in the success of the gun reforms. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Implementation of rockfall risk reduction strategies on Christmas Island.</PARA>
<PARA>A landslide risk assessment report on Christmas Island tabled in October 1995 highlighted the possibility that rock falls could cause fatality, injury and damage to or loss of Commonwealth property and community assets. In this context the Attorney-General's Department advised that, as injury is foreseeable, the Commonwealth owes a duty of care to the people who occupy Commonwealth land and buildings in the Kampong and that it should implement all appropriate risk reduction strategies to reduce risk of injury to people or property in the Kampong area where that is reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The areas directly affected include Commonwealth owned high&hyphen;density residential units&mdash;blocks 408 and 412&mdash;which are occupied by government employees and public housing tenants. There are also other Commonwealth and community used buildings which have been identified at risk, including the boat club area, the marine building, the Malay workshop and the Malay school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In December 1995 the former government referred to the PWC proposals to relocate the affected residents and to construct rock fall defensive measures. The evidence subsequently prepared for consideration by the PWC indicated the proposed package would cost over $20 million but included a range of alternatives. The election was called before the PWC could visit the island to investigate the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to referring the matter to the PWC, the former government approved an allocation of $1.191 million in 1995-96 for works associated with the proposals. This commitment was recently confirmed by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2005"> Minister for the Environment, Senator the Hon. Robert Hill. Since the preparation of the PWC evidence, additional risk evaluation analysis has been commissioned in relation to the range of alternative strategies that could be undertaken to respond to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although estimates for constructing only rock fall defences are less than the $6 million threshold for PWC consideration, those which involve relocation of residents exceed $6 million. When the risk evaluation results are available it is likely that the decision as to which is the most appropriate course of action will involve a balanced judgment, weighing up all the economic and social factors. Because of the potential effect on the community, the PWC is the most appropriate body to carry out the necessary investigations and to make recommendations to the government on this matter. I commend this motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We support the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill. This bill arises from those tragic circumstances in Port Arthur with which we are all in melancholy fashion familiar. From that point we came to the successful outcome that the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams), who is at the table, conducted along with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his relevant state counterparts by which, in return for the Commonwealth undertaking to fund the buyback of soon to be illegal weapons in Australia, they would agree to legislate in accordance with a series of propositions which dramatically reduce access to high&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> powered semiautomatic weapons in this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to be credible and ensure that the agreement sticks, it is absolutely essential that this legislation passes, and that is in no small part the reason for the opposition supporting it. We as a party have in government a reasonable and proud record, I believe, of attempting to persuade those in the political processes in Australia, now coming up with the right answers, to have tighter gun control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wake of the last most horrific massacres&mdash;those at Hoddle Street and Queen Street&mdash;the Commonwealth, the states and the territories back in 1987 formed a committee on violence and sought wide&hyphen;ranging responses to the problem of violence in the Australian community. The committee's report in 1990 provided the blueprint for comprehensive reform. Following the Strathfield killings, the federal Labor government banned the importation of automatic submachine gun-like and high velocity weapons. In 1991 an agreement was reached on a national uniform gun licensing system, but some of the states subsequently resiled from it. In November of last year several years work on national uniform gun licensing laws by the former Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr, was stymied by opposition from the states at a meeting in Hobart. The attempt to relaunch the debate in February of this year was cut short by the federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have, as I said before, a record of strong support for the view that access to firearms, particularly high-powered and semiautomatic firearms, ought to be severely restricted. We were unsuccessful, having had several bites of the cherry, in persuading the states as to the validity of those views. I guess there is some indication, in the vehemence of opposition to the propositions now despite the very strong and obvious community support, why the states in the past may have been reluctant to move upon this. For whatever reason, those various attempts that we made failed, except in so far as we were completely in control of the process, including in relation to the importation of weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the minister on the agreement that he reached with the states with the Prime <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2006"> Minister's help. It is a good agreement. There is compromise in that agreement. There is reasonable provision made for people who have a legitimate reason for access to weapons. Of course, it is not a template for legislation that involves banning weapons. People will still have access to weapons they require for various purposes on quite reasonable conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that a set of weapons which has no place in the civilian community outside those very limited circumstances will, as a result of these actions, now remain outside the civilian community. But, in order to achieve that and properly enforce it, the essential cog in that process will be this legislation. A reasonable price has to be offered. Many people in this community have acquired in absolutely good faith&mdash;and with absolutely no criminal intent of course&mdash;weapons now to be made illegal. Those weapons serve purposes which they personally consider entirely legitimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an environment in which it is extremely difficult for law enforcement officers to operate. To give them the best chance to operate in this environment, a just terms acquisition of the weapons is absolutely essential. I have no criticism of anything that the government has done to this point in this area. I would just make a couple of points here by way of suggestion. It would be wise to err on the side of generosity in evaluation of the weapons. They are not all of a uniform cost. Some weapons cost a great deal more. They do not have an antique character to them and are not semiautomatic. Nevertheless, they may have a longstanding familial connection. There needs to be, if this law is to be effectively enforced, a bit of give in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know who has to enforce these laws. It is not anybody sitting in this chamber, nor anybody sitting in any parliament. It is the police forces who, as individuals, have their own families to consider and their own concerns about life and limb who will have to approach people to take control of these weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to urge the states to hurry up and pass their legislation. They are all agreed upon it. They know what is right and they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know that the community is basically behind it. Rapid legislation will assist them in going through the processes of convincing the community that the right course is being followed. It is not as though these matters have not had a decent airing in the Australian community; they have had a very decent airing. It is not as though all the arguments are not known; they have been out there for a very long time. The point has come for conclusions, and the conclusions that have been reached have majority support. Therefore, there is no need for any hesitation in legislation, and the states ought to get on with it and complete the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a few little observation points in the debate so far that I think are relevant to make here. Guns in our community inflict far more pain with far greater regularity than events at Port Arthur suggest. Over the 10 years from 1984 to 1994, nearly 80 per cent of firearm related deaths were suicides&mdash;that is 5,500 people. Firearm related suicide is a particular tragedy for Australia's rural communities and Australia's youth. A recent study shows that from 1989 to 1993 the firearm suicide rate amongst males aged between 15 and 24 was up to seven times higher in rural than metropolitan areas&mdash;31 versus 4 in 100,000. Without access to a firearm many of these people almost certainly would be alive today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, guns contribute to the number of suicides by providing an all too accessible means of self&hyphen;destruction for people in crisis. I will quote from a forthcoming article by Dr Michael Dudley et al entitled `Suicide Among Young Rural Australians 1964 to 1993&mdash;A Comparison with Metropolitan Trends'. It is going to be published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology on Suicide amongst Young Rural Australians</EMPHASIS>. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the frequency, impulsivity and low intent of many youth suicide attempts, the association with drugs and alcohol, the role of peer networks and suggestibility, especially in relation to the media and the high lethality of guns, many attempts must be converted into deaths by the presence of a firearm.   <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2007"> </PARA>
<PARA>I realise that applies to all firearms, and it is not by any means the intention of this legislation to ban all firearms. The rural districts, of course, have the most legitimate reasons for access to and use of firearms. But, given that this exercise involves a licensing regime as well as particular restrictions on certain types of weapons, it is well to contemplate and comprehend that some of these elements of the issue do bear a deal of thinking about. It is not as though there is not a bit of knowledge out there as to the potential implications of the possession of weapons in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do hear another argument from those who say they need weapons to ensure their own personal safety and that of their families. I do not doubt for one minute that these are honestly held concerns, particularly for women and families in remote areas. There is always going to be, in the bush in particular, a sense of distance from places of help and support, a sense of isolation and a proper concern for the requirements of self&hyphen;defence. But it is clear that the incidence of self&hyphen;defence in some so&hyphen;called home invasion cases is far lower than the intensity of its reportage suggests. It is particularly tragic when the penalty for low-level breaking and entering becomes death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also particularly tragic when a person possesses a firearm but may not be able to use it effectively, in which circumstances a weapon of defence becomes a weapon of attack. Anybody who has had any association with the military&mdash;and there are many around who have&mdash;would know that the correct and effective use of firearms is a skill which takes a while to acquire. Sensible storage is also an issue which does not always readily come to mind for the average owner of a firearm. Apart from anything else, the much more intense scrutiny that will go on as a result of the legislation introduced by the states into firearms ownership will increase a sense of obligation, I believe, on owners to properly make themselves aware of all the issues involved in the proper ownership, storage and usage of weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of parliament throughout Australia have an historic opportunity to guide our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> society in the right direction. Gun laws make a demonstrable difference to violence in society. Just consider the following figures. The United States has a virulent pro-gun culture and notoriously loose gun laws. Australia and Canada have comparatively stricter gun laws but, as we know, they are not the tightest in the world. The United Kingdom is widely regarded as having some of the strongest firearm laws in the world and a clear traditional belief that guns threaten peaceful society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how do the homicide statistics compare? In 1994 firearm homicides in the United States comprised 70 per cent of a total homicide rate of nine people in every 100,000. In Australia and Canada firearm homicides comprised less than 30 per cent of a total homicide rate of around two people in every 100,000. In England and Wales firearm homicides were less than 10 per cent of total homicides, with a homicide rate of closer to one person in 100,000. One must always be careful with causality, but here we have three progressively tighter sets of gun laws, three progressively lower homicide rates and a progressively smaller firearms share of total homicides&mdash;tighter gun laws, fewer deaths and fewer of them caused by guns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will raise some $500 million towards the buyback scheme. I do not think any of us really know what the cost of the scheme is likely to be. We have some vague idea, and the $500 million mark was around the middle range of guesstimates that were put in place, as I seem to recollect, from the time of the Port Arthur massacre when we were all sitting down and mulling over these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Personally, I think it is probably a bit on the low side, in which case this may be an issue that needs to be revisited at some time. As I said in my remarks a bit earlier on, I think it would be most unwise for us to permit the states to be put in a position where a serious argument&mdash;as opposed simply to mischievousness&mdash;could be entertained that people were not being properly compensated, that people were not receiving value for what they put forward and that, therefore, people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2008"> ought not to hand their weapons in where those weapons needed to be handed in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government found itself in a position where it did not have adequate resources, then I, on behalf the opposition, would not for one minute blame them. None of us know. If they needed to come back to the well, then we would be happy to consider that position favourably. It is absolutely important that this works and that it works in the next 12 months&mdash;and this is central to us being able to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I think it is important also for the states which have to handle this legislation. There is a small amount of evidence of a degree of backsliding in one particular state. The Attorney-General has indicated that he does intend to follow that up. I think it is very important that he does do that. Every state Premier, every state Attorney&hyphen;General, knows that this has the support of a massive preponderance of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Prime Minister and the National Party are being admonished to sell this idea. There is a great deal of concern attached to an alleged failure to convince people of all of this. I really do not think there is any failure there at all. The issues are well known by those who are protesting. It does not really matter what the Prime Minister says; he will not convince any of them of the rightness of his cause. At some point in time in a democracy there is a vote and a conclusion is reached, albeit with all the consultation under the sun that has to be done. We have actually reached this point. There has been a lot of sensible adjustment around the edges to the agreement that has been reached. There does not need to be any more in that regard. The position has been reached where we ought to conclude these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> My advice&mdash;so far as it is worth their while taking&mdash;to the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Prime Minister is to stop worrying about it. They have an audience that they have to keep on track and that happens to be the states. They are doing all that they possibly can to keep that agreement in good shape. The seeming political storm around their ears is just that&mdash;seeming. It is not something that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they need at the end of the day to overly concern themselves with. We will give this legislation reasonably speedy passage, but in particular I hope that the legislation from the various states gets a speedy passage. This is an essential change. It is the right course of action. Just about every member of this parliament supports it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to record my strongest support for the new regulations and trust there will be no wavering in the government's position despite the noisy and desperate protestations of the gun owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all the talk about "rights" I believe we have failed the thirty five who died at Port Arthur most miserably in protecting their most basic of human rights, the right to live.</PARA>
<PARA>A third letter, from Mr and Mrs Eisler of Killara, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Dr Nelson,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just a brief note to ask you to convey to the Prime Minister my family's full support in the stand taken on Gun Laws. Same praise to Mr Beazley on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA>The Medicare levy is the appropriate vehicle for raising the funds necessary, as in every sense I see the gun control debate as a health issue. It is about the protection of human life not only in its literal form but also in terms of our national values and the priorities we attach to the protection of one another. The 0.2 per cent increase in the levy to 1.7 per cent of taxable income for one year will raise, as the Leader of the Opposition just said, around $500 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has said that any money in excess of that required to buy back prohibited weapons&mdash;I again tend to agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it is probably a middle order figure&mdash;will be put back into the health system. I urge the government to specifically direct any excess resources to improve mental health care facilities and community based services in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed legislation to be passed in each jurisdiction will effectively establish a national gun register of firearms, thereby linking a gun with every licensed owner. A police reference system will provide the facility for cross-checking owners with guns. We are required to register motor vehicles and their drivers, and now with a photographic identification. Why not also identify both the gun and the owner?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent comments by some parliamentarians advocating a gun owners' register as distinct from a gun register can be described only as unhelpful. As a strategy for curbing gun violence, seeking to register and control owners without also their guns will have little effect and represents a dangerous and orchestrated diversion from efforts to comprehensively reform gun laws. Whilst I am sure that the advocates of such registers are often well motivated by seeking to disarm what they consider to be the homicidal maniac who has managed to get a gun licence but not yet a gun, contrary to popular mythology, all but one of the perpetrators of Australian mass shootings since 1988 were not known to be dangerous. The gun lobby must understand that the most likely perpetrator of gun violence is not a criminal or a crazed maniac but the apparently normal gun owner who kills either himself and/or people who are close to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the accessibility of guns themselves, not the holding of a licence by any particular member of that household, that creates the danger. If someone wants to report to police a dangerous person, it is absolutely essential that the police be able to establish whether there is access to a gun. A mechanism must exist which links the person to the gun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also urge state and territory governments, in passing legislation to complement this Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, to consider mechanisms for automatically cancelling the gun licence of a person convicted of three successive drink driving offences, as it is well known that such individuals have a 90 per cent probability of alcohol dependence. Under these circumstances, such people often face personal, marital and economic hardship and may also be prone to irrational behaviour. I believe that this is incompatible with continuing to hold a gun licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, if individuals holding a gun licence are convicted of a drug or drug related offence, a mechanism should exist for automatically withdrawing their licence to hold a gun and for their firearms to be surrendered. Although most of these individuals are not engaged in criminal or impulsive behaviour, there is a higher probability that they will be.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2010">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also urge police authorities to search for weapons whenever they are called to a domestic dispute or to seize firearms under circumstances where domestic violence has either occurred or is likely to occur. Simply waiting until apprehended domestic violence orders have been issued is in my personal, and on two occasions tragic, experience often too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As political representatives across the country are placed under increasing pressure to retreat from the position on gun control developed by the Prime Minister and the Australasian Police Ministers Council, it is our duty to keep bringing the issue back to what it is all about. It is not about the perceived rights of individuals to bear arms or the invasion of Australia by foreign forces and the conspiratorial theories of some extreme elements in the gun lobby. It is about the other 99 per cent of us saying that we have had enough. We are trying to do everything that we can to change the values and thinking of Australians, including our culture of violence, of which the gun issue is but one manifestation, and the right of families to live lives that as far as practicable are free from the fear of wanton mass destruction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ironically, as I have done many times before, three days before the Port Arthur massacre I was debating yet another representative of the gun lobby on an Adelaide radio station about a gun control summit to be convened by the Australian Medical Association. He, like so many of his well&hyphen;meaning but frequently misguided colleagues, placed the burden of proof on the rest of us to demonstrate that tougher gun laws would actually reduce injury and death. It reminds me of the tobacco companies and their apologists continually challenging me to prove how many lives could be saved through stricter regulations on the promotion of tobacco before we would take any action. In other words, how many people do we have to prove will be killed before we are prepared to get off our collective backsides and do something about gun control? What we can say with absolute certainty is that, if we do nothing, nothing will change and when inevitably&mdash;as it will&mdash;the next gun massacre occurs, we will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> always ask ourselves why we did not do everything we possibly could to prevent it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1992 we have averaged 620 gun deaths a year in Australia. Eighty per cent of these have been from suicide, 15 per cent from interpersonal violence and about four per cent from accident. The gun laws which are proposed may not prevent another mass tragedy, and I suppose we will never know if they do. However, they will most certainly have a favourable impact on suicide by use of a firearm and on domestic violence involving guns. One study published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> by Cantor and Slater in June 1995 reviewed suicide rates in metropolitan and provincial city areas throughout Queensland from 1990 to 1993. After more effective gun laws had been passed there was a reduction in suicide rates, especially in 15&hyphen; to 29&hyphen;year&hyphen;old men, by some 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, Professor Martin Killias from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland published in the Canadian Medical Association journal in 1993 the results of an international crime survey in 11 European countries, Australia, Canada and the USA of international correlations between gun ownership and rates of homicide and suicide. He found positive correlations between the rates of household gun ownership and the national rates of homicide and suicide as well as the proportions of homicides and suicides committed with a gun. There also appeared not to be a compensation process. Residents of countries with low rates of gun ownership did not use other means to commit homicide or suicide to make up for the absence of guns. His concluding remarks are rather prophetic. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of the political agenda, the question is whether the ever increasing trend in gun ownership can be reversed as long as the possibility can be entertained that guns are not as dangerous as the observed correlations and commonsense would suggest. Unfortunately, any further waiting for more convincing evidence may jeopardise more rigorous approaches to gun control, since beyond a certain point significantly reducing the number of the guns in the hands of private citizens becomes a hopeless task. Therefore, the crucial policy question is: how much time do we have left to wait for more research, particularly in countries where <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2011"> gun ownership is not widespread and where social policies aimed at restraining its use might be most beneficial in terms of reducing violence?</PARA>
<PARA>Through my 13 years in medical practice I have had a loaded gun pointed at me on two occasions. I have attended three shootings. In one case a child was fatally shot by his own brother. I have also attended a home where a man took a shotgun to his head in the lounge room whilst his family, including children, were in an adjoining room.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also attended small, modest housing commission flats and homes where guns hang on walls the way many of us would hang a picture or a trophy. On one occasion in such a home significant amounts of alcohol had been consumed, the ambient temperature at the time was 38 degrees and a dispute had erupted with a neighbour over the behaviour of a dog. You do not need to be a doctor to appreciate the ingredients for potential diaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some members will say that those of us who strongly support these proposals are engaged in an `emotional knee jerk'. I am one of a number of people who have been arguing for gun control for almost a decade and I can assure you there is nothing knee jerk about it. Thirty&hyphen;five people lost their lives in the Port Arthur massacre. Every member of this parliament when considering this bill should ask themselves, `How would I feel if one of those 35 people were a member of my own family?' If they were, the dangerously misguided bantering of some extreme elements of the gun lobby would have a hollow ring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Long after this parliament has dissolved we will be remembered not for the seemingly endless bickering over issues of transient value but for the determined value we place on the lives of those we are here to represent. I urge the Leader of the Opposition to show what I sense he is made of. I urge him to go out, as he has done this evening, and tell those sections of the gun lobby campaigning against sitting government members that on this issue they campaign in vain, that it is an exercise in utter futility, that a change from coalition to Labor on gun control will make no difference whatsoever.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend this bill to the House and in doing so congratulate the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and, in particular, my colleagues in regional seats on both sides of this chamber, who have had the courage to maintain their support for what is right despite the considerable pressure that has been placed upon them. The bill should be seen as doing much more than simply raising $500 million over a 12-month period, but very much as everyday Australians who do never write to politicians trying to get some control over their lives and things which often seem so uncontrollable.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Tuesday I attended a rally in Bathurst of 750 pro&hyphen;gun supporters largely organised by the Sporting Shooters Association. It was billed as being a rally against the government and against all those who support the sort of legislation that the states and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have suggested. The meeting was organised in such a fashion that it was not confrontational. Many of those people were perhaps among the extremists in the pro&hyphen;gun lobby. The meeting was very orderly. They heard what I had to say, which essentially was a total defence of the position of the Prime Minister and the states and a hope that the legislation could go through without any alteration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was anger, of course, and there were extremely disappointed people who asked me whether there was any room for compromise, to which I largely said that I believed there was very little. I must commend the organisers of the meeting for the way in which they conducted it, unlike perhaps the meeting in Victoria yesterday. I agreed to take a petition from that meeting to deliver to this House. Much as I disagree with the contents of it, I saw it as my job as a representative of those people to present their point of view to this House. That petition was delivered today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see in this debate three levels. There is the extreme, those conspiracy theorists who see some worldwide conspiracy to deny them the right to firearm ownership. I see people who regard the right to own a firearm as part of their right to defend the country. Some people truly believe that they are the last line of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2012"> defence in an invasion. I see a middle range of people too&mdash;young people in particular&mdash;who come from fairly deprived circumstances, people who have probably been brought up in a working home where a firearm for sporting shooting was perhaps a pastime that their grandfather enjoyed during the Depression when they went out to shoot rabbits as perhaps their only means of food. That tradition has been handed on&mdash;that culture, if you like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are many supporters of both sides of politics in the range of opposition to these laws and many of them feel bewildered that they are losing a pastime and weapons that they saw as very much part of their culture, rightly or wrongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is a third level&mdash;that caring, considerate group of people who would never present a threat to anyone with that weaponry. They realise, though, that they must surrender those firearms and make do. I believe they can make do&mdash;they say they can&mdash;with those categories that are being provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The supporters of these laws in my electorate&mdash;mainly women&mdash;outnumber by 15 to one those who are totally opposed to them. I think that women believe the only good gun law is one that has no guns in the community. But there are those who are collectors and who see their heirlooms being surrendered; they see things being taken away from them and they feel they are being blamed for something that they had nothing to do with. I said I could appreciate their point of view but that it certainly would not persuade me to alter my stance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farmers I have met in my electorate largely see the need for such laws and they see plenty of scope within the categories offered to satisfied their requirements. The national gun register is seen in some areas as a threat to secrecy and something akin to the Australia card. When the question was raised about the identity of the gun that might or might not have been handed in a decade ago that could have turned up again in Tasmania, the Victorian police commissioner said it was essential that we had a national register to determine that very factor of where guns go across borders and who owns them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about the viability of the buyback scheme&mdash;how it is to be determined and what value is to be given to the weapons. I see concern amongst people about the licence fee, that it could be some sort of ongoing taxing instrument for the government. It should be built into the legislation somewhere that the licence fee be given a consumer price index rating and not suddenly lifted to tax people, particularly those who do not have many means but who enjoy sporting shooting as a pastime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps there should have been more consultation. There is a feeling that this is being imposed&mdash;but of course we cannot afford the time to go out and consult all those elements in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge fair&hyphen;minded Australians to understand those giving up those items as much as we urge the hotheads and the extremists to back off because they do not represent the mainstream and the majority. But I also urge just as determined and serious an examination of video violence and the support we offer those in our community with mental health problems, many of whom have been set adrift from the former close scrutiny and support they once received from a more formal institutionalised system. I am not arguing for more institutional care. I am simply saying many have slipped through the net and have been largely left to their own or their family's devices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the media should also be questioned on the way it makes a meal out of situations like sieges or whatever. I came to the bush from the city where, as a producer of news, I was a party to the exploitation of these circumstances&mdash;the turning of someone from a Joe Blow in the suburbs to a hero during the day through the exposure that person got. By the end of the day they had probably blown themselves away&mdash;and one or two of their children. That worried me and that drove me out of Sydney to a region where you are much more accountable for your coverage of such things. The media must examine their role in the coverage of situations where weapons are used. I hope that beyond these laws for firearms there will be an equally determined look at video violence, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2013"> mental health care and coverage by media organisations: it is not easy but we should be looking at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With those reservations, I commend this bill to the House. I applaud the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and particularly the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) for their roles in this. The Attorney&hyphen;General is the unsung hero in all of this for his quiet determination and the manner in which he has presented this case. I believe that his credibility has done a lot to sell this measure to the vast majority of Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Medicare levy is imposed on the taxable income of people who are residents of Australia for income tax purposes and is collected in association with income tax. The levy is currently set at 1.5 per cent of taxable income and will increase to 1.7 per cent for one year as a one-off moneys collection scheme to fund the compensation scheme which the states and territories will be required to pay gun owners as the nationwide ban on semiautomatic firearms comes into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Medicare levy is not payable below certain income levels and shade&hyphen;in ranges also apply. In 1995-96, the low income threshold is $12,870 for individuals and $21,718 for couples and sole parents. There is an additional threshold with each child so that, for example, a family with three children and a taxable income below $28,000 will not pay the Medicare levy in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since that terrible Sunday afternoon at Port Arthur on 28 April, the debate about gun ownership in Australia has gone through at least two stages. After the initial shock felt around Australia came discussion on how best to deal with the availability of certain types of firearms in the Australian community. This included technical debate on what constituted a semiautomatic firearm and how gun owners were to be compensated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To his credit, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) moved quickly on the issue. After dialogue with state authorities, they came to an historic agreement to ban all semiautomatics except in some exceptional circumstances and to fund the buyback of these weapons with a one-off increase in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Medicare levy. The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill provides the Commonwealth with the finances to make good on its commitment to take these firearms out of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the agreement with the states, however, the debate on gun ownership has expanded to incorporate discussions over the threat to civil liberty and the right to bear arms. To some degree, the debate has been appropriated by a vocal and extremist minority. It is this development in the debate which I would like to address tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right to bear arms in Australia is an implied right. It is not enshrined in the constitution, as it is in the United States. This implied right to bear arms is not inalienable but confirmed by this country's tolerance of gun ownership in the past and is enshrined in state and Commonwealth law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike America, the necessity of owning a firearm has not been translated into an inalienable right. The reason for that difference is that the history and cultural development, especially in regard to gun ownership, of Australia and America differ dramatically. I believe that the radical elements within the gun owning community would do best to keep this in mind when they next contribute to the current discussion on gun ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say from the outset that any attempt to locate the existence or necessity of a dominant gun culture in Australia's history is a farce. Although the tragedy of colonisation for indigenous Australians has many unfortunate episodes, such as the 1928 Coniston massacre in which 70 Aboriginals were gunned down, relative to the United States the gun has played only a small part in the development of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scale of the Indian wars in North America, for example, surpasses anything experienced in Australia. Modern America was founded upon the often brutal suppression of the indigenous people. The scale, duration and intensity of the conflict confirmed the firearm as a centrepiece of America's frontier culture. The status of the United States as an independent republic was guaranteed only after the War of Independence, which was waged against the British not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2014"> by organised armies but most often by militia units armed with their own firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The normalisation of gun ownership was considered an appropriate guarantee against tyranny and oppression from the colonial masters. Later, the modern boundaries of the United States were confirmed after conflict with Mexico. Perhaps most tragically of all, the American Civil War, which set the precedence for savagery in modern warfare, embarked America on a course which determined the modern culture and political make&hyphen;up of that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">America has had an undeniably violent past where the gun has played a crucial and central role. As such, the right to bear arms has been enshrined in the constitution despite the problems that the easy availability of firearms causes in the urban centres throughout the country. Currently in America 70 per cent of homicides are gun related.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Australia has no such history, nor has it witnessed the physical scale of such human conflict. This country was pioneered not with the gun but with innovation and perseverance&mdash;mostly against Australia's harsh environment&mdash;of explorers, humanitarians and settlers. The modern Australian culture of multiculturalism, mateship and helping out the underdog is based on a history of tolerance, of openness to difference and persistence in times of hardship, drought and flood and fire, not upon the prolonged clash of cultures as seen in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A sticker in a Tasmanian gun shop states `God, Guns and Guts made Australia free'. Well, certainly guts helped, as did a good deal of self&hyphen;help. The gun has only been involved in some of the more unfortunate episodes of Australia's history and has never contributed in peacetime to the improvement or development of modern Australian culture. There is simply no justification for gun culture in modern Australia. The gun is not, nor should it be, a fixture of Australian folklore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of these unfortunate episodes continue today. Currently, one&hyphen;third of all homicides take place within the family. Of these, one&hyphen;third can be attributed to firearm deaths. In 1994, there were 79 firearm homicides, 420</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The vast majority of firearms homicides are unplanned and impulsive, and in all likelihood should not occur if such a lethal weapon were not to hand. The availability of a firearm in these circumstances makes death a far greater likelihood, for research has demonstrated that the death rate for victims assaulted by guns is seven times that of those assaulted with lethal intent by knives or other weapons.</PARA>
<PARA>I therefore fully support the statements by the AMA which have equated the Prime Minister's gun control initiatives with sound preventive medicine. As the Prime Minister has commented, this bill `represents an enormous shift in the culture of this country'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia, as a sovereign nation, has chosen not to blindly follow where America has gone before. This is a decision to maintain Australia's separate and unique identity and Australia's culture is unique. Its colonised past and the more recent influence of multiculturalism and the success of integration make us a vastly different country to the United States. I believe that this bill is a sign of national maturity, particularly given the bipartisan support the agreement with the states has received from all major parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that Australia is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 6 of the covenant states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law.</PARA>
<PARA>Shooters in Australia still have a vast array of weaponry to choose from. Bolt action rifles, the most common type of rifles, are still readily available, as are some types of shotguns. There is simply no practical need for semiautomatic firearms in this country. Indeed, military style rifles have only been available in Australia in significant numbers since the mid&hyphen;1980s. I do not think it is a coincidence that the gun lobby also emerged about the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst acknowledging that many law abiding gun owners will be inconvenienced by this buyback, this bill is not a vehicle to remove guns completely from this community. It is a sensible attempt to ensure that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2015"> scale of bloodshed witnessed at Port Arthur is not repeated. High rates of fire and the large magazine capacity of these military style firearms allow rapid, indiscriminate firing at targets and require no mechanical action that allow a break in the mood of the operator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Michelle Levine, a Melbourne businesswoman in the vicinity of the shooting at Port Arthur, recalled, `Shots came in bursts, as if he was hunting.' Another eyewitness, Jim Laycock, also recalls, `I just heard the gun going off repeatedly and she'&mdash;in reference to another of the gunman's victims&mdash;`didn't have a chance.' The gunman fired several hundred rounds from his centre&hyphen;fire semiautomatic rifle. In a space of eight minutes, he managed to kill over 20 people and wounded many more at the Broad Arrow restaurant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, a semiautomatic assault rifle with detachable scope, bayonet and 30-shot banana clip will set you back about $500. Research conducted by the Parliamentary Library also notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ballistic characteristics of military style rifles also reduce their usefulness in roles other than those that they were designed for&mdash;that is, killing enemy soldiers.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Association of Professional Shooters says, no civil occupation or recreation in this nation lends itself to the need for rapid&hyphen;fire as opposed to single&hyphen;shot weapons. Yet Firearm Owners Association Vice President, Ian McNiven, assures us that gun control is a `brutal totalitarian attack on our fundamental freedoms', but at least in Australia the right to possess a firearm is neither a fundamental right nor a freedom. It is more so a privilege granted to individuals that needs to be consistently reassessed as social dynamics change around us. In the wake of Port Arthur, the time to redefine the terms of gun ownership is ripe. After talking to family members in the country, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  writer Sally Loanne reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People on the land, reasonable people who use single barrel shot&hyphen;guns responsibly as one of their tools of the trade . . . are horrified that they have been lumped together with the loony, extremist fringe of the gun lobby . . . they wear flannel shirts and American baseball hats . . . On weekends they load up their arsenal and drive into the bush . . . They blast the daylights out of road signs, mailbox <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> es and native birds . . . The sensible heartland of the bush, which has no use for military&hyphen;style guns of any kind . . . is appalled . . . the views of sensible, mainstream rural Australia are reflected in the support of the Prime Minister's gun control proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say that family members of mine in rural Australia hold exactly the same views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is known that the gun lobby is well organised and well financed and, whilst most shooter organisations are legitimate and are part of the democratic make&hyphen;up of Australia, I would encourage all members of this House to remain focused on the issues at hand and not be intimidated by the gun lobby's more radical elements. As reported in the latest issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine, only four per cent of those polled would vote against a political candidate if advised to do so by a gun group. Ninety&hyphen;six per cent said they would not. Forty&hyphen;three per cent responded that the gun lobby already wields too much political power. In an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> poll of over 2000 Australians conducted on 3 to 5 May this year, 90 per cent of those surveyed supported a national ban on all automatic and semiautomatic firearms. A recent article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS> pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members and supporters of the Australian gun lobby who lament the so&hyphen;called erosion of their `fundamental freedoms' should accept that all their rights, all their freedoms, flow from, the same founding principle&mdash;democracy. It says that the will of the majority will prevail. In the weeks since the Port Arthur killings the majority has spoken very clearly.</PARA>
<PARA>In a recent letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , Elyse Singleton of Lane Cove wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I heard a member of the Queensland gun lobby complaining about the loss of freedom. Excuse me sir, but what about the freedom to eat one's lunch in a cafe or walk with one's daughter down the road unharmed?</PARA>
<PARA>The support shown by the mainstream political parties for tighter gun control is important. At the launch of a petition supporting uniform gun laws and the gun levy, which is incorporated in the bill before the House, the Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a rare event in Australian politics that brings together the leaders of the two major political parties . . . in a united commitment to a piece of legislation and a political Act, clearly designed to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2016"> improve the future of this country. I can't think of an event in the 22 years that I've been in politics that has so galvanised the politic leadership of this country, has so brought together the major political parties of this country for a purpose which will achieve a permanent change for the better in the way in which this country conducts its affairs, and the circumstances on which the men and women of this country live out their lives.</PARA>
<PARA>A one&hyphen;off increase in the Medicare levy to help rid the community of these weapons is a very pragmatic solution to a problem which is caught up in many moral and legal complexities. I agree with Michael McCabe from my electorate, who said in a recent letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  that he was happy to contribute to the nominated levy, which in his view was `more an investment than an expense'. It not only invests in public safety and the reduction in the menace these weapons present to the community but also distinguishes Australia as a nation determined to maintain its cultural and historical integrity. This bill is about working towards a safer Australia. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate strong support for the proposal to increase the Medicare levy to provide a fund to meet the cost of compensation for firearms which are surrendered following the adoption of uniform laws by the states and territories in the terms agreed on at the special meeting of the Australasian Police Ministers Council on 10 May. Paragraph 11.2 of the briefing paper of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) points out:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No reliable figures of total numbers of firearms in Australia are available. Estimates for all firearms vary from 3.5 million (as suggested to the National Committee on Violence) to over 10 million. Best estimates of the numbers of military-style semi-automatics suggest around 350,000 throughout Australia. Best estimates for other semi-automatic, self-loading or pump action longarms suggest around 3,000,000.</PARA>
<PARA>The pro-gun lobby rally in Melbourne on 1 June attracted 70,000 protesters and there were 35,000 in Sydney last weekend. These numbers are not very surprising when a group of people has been cynically manipulated into believing that they are under threat. Specific interest is a powerful motivator for turning out. Citizens opposed to violence and the gun <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> culture have deep but general concerns, and that makes them unlikely to take to the streets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At its rallies the gun lobby has been promoting eight major fallacies. One: Shooters are equated with farmers. Farmers use guns as a necessity, not for pleasure, to protect or put down stock and to eliminate feral animals, including rabbits. But they do not insist on using military style weapons. Why should sporting shooters? The burden of proof to justify gun ownership and use must always be on the proponents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two: Shooters are equated with soldiers. If the leaders of the gun community are at war, they have declared it on Australian democracy and the great majority of Australians, who abhor killing and killing machines. Australia has never relied on armed guerillas and it is impossible to imagine a situation where we could possibly need them. It is not part of our history or tradition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) pointed out, the gun was central to the US frontier tradition but not to ours. Four US presidents were shot to death by gunmen and three more were shot at. One British Prime Minister was killed by a gun. No Australian Prime Minister, not even a Premier, has been killed by a gun. To equate the use of automatics and semiautomatics for private pleasure with the operations of Australian forces in both world wars is a grotesque distortion of our history. Using national shrines for pro-gun demonstrations was particularly offensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three: Shooters are equated with police. Sporting shooters are not guardians of social order. That is not their role, never has been and never should be. We do not want and do not need vigilante groups. A well-trained, professional, careful police force is able to guard civil society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Four: Gun ownership and use are equated with freedom. This is a spurious and alien tradition promoted by the National Rifle Association, one of the most powerful lobbies in the US, which has helped fund pro-gun protests in Australia. Guns threaten life and liberty. In the US homicide rates are nine times higher than in Australia. The UK <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2017"> tradition&mdash;asserting that guns threaten a peaceful society&mdash;is far more appropriate. There is no constitutional right in Australia for citizens to use guns. The 1689 Bill of Rights confined gun ownership to Protestants, not Catholics, and only in conformity with the law. The right was not absolute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Five: `Guns never hurt anyone.' This is Ted Drane's curious line. But guns are machines for killing and wounding; that is their primary purpose. A madman with a gun can inflict infinitely more damage in a few moments than a madman with an axe or a baseball bat. The roles of the human agent and his instrument are inseparable. I say `his' because gun ownership and use is overwhelmingly a male characteristic. The minute's silence for Port Arthur victims at gun rallies has been nauseating in its hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Six: `Shooters are victims.' This is an example of special pleading. What is needed is full disclosure, rigid control and uniform laws throughout all states and territories, ensuring that weapons of mass destruction cannot be just bought over the counter. Where weapons are surrendered, there will be full compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seven: `We are not guilty.' This has been a recurrent theme on campaign banners, and some have gone further: `What next&mdash;concentration camps?' Nobody is being charged generally or specifically with anything. There is no guilt by association. The old common law principle asserted that the right to use dangerous instruments and to have access to guns, poisons or explosives imposed a duty of care, and the community was entitled to be aware of risk&mdash;hence the need for full disclosure and transparency. Much of the objection of the gun lobby has been directed at registration of firearms, including an inventory of where the weapons are, how many there are and their capacity. But does anyone claim that compulsory registration of motor vehicles or that a poisons or explosives register overturns the presumption of innocence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Eight: `They're going to take all our guns.' Fears about the effects of compulsory registration of guns and uniform laws and regulations across all states and territories are wildly exaggerated. The argument is that, if govern ment&mdash;that is, the community&mdash;knows where the guns are, one day they will all be confiscated. Again, there is no basis for this, and the Attorney-General's paper asserts the contrary. The proposed ban essentially applies to military style weapons. A common thread running through this is the obsessional view that we face Armageddon, that an armed citizenry is the only line of defence against a baffling and threatening world and that government in a sense is part of the enemy and therefore government has to be resisted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the armaments industry, another powerful lobby, deserves sharp scrutiny. In this time of political unity about gun controls, it is disappointing to reflect on lost opportunities in the past. John Cain attempted to bring in tough gun laws in the 1980s and was then vigorously opposed by the Liberal and National parties. In 1988 Barrie Unsworth, then New South Wales Premier, proposed tighter state and national gun laws, and strong attacks by the Liberal and National parties defeated his efforts and contributed to his defeat. As he turned on his heel, he said something that was eerily prophetic: it will require the act of some lunatic in Tasmania to realise that all this has to be revisited. He was absolutely right. We should have had national agreement on firearms in 1988. It would have been a pretty good bicentennial present to the nation. Eight years have now passed with many lives lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue where Labor offers total unqualified support to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). On the issues of gun control and uniform legislation, there is no Liberal, National, Democrat or Labor position&mdash;or even an Independent one. We are one, deeply united in support of a peaceful civil society. Every state or territory government, of whatever party, has agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appeal to gun owners, of which there are many in my electorate: do not allow yourselves to be manipulated into adopting the rhetoric of hysterical rebellion against and defiance of the law and democratic practice. That is not a view that is accepted by the great majority of gun owners, but I think they are being manipulated in a quite sinister and utterly cynical way.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2018">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to understand why guns are so essential to a significant number of men. It seems to be part of defining masculinity. Why is it that some men feel weak, impotent, unhappy and threatened without guns? We really need to know&mdash;and so do they. Masculinity is not under threat, but it needs to be redefined and talked about openly. There is much concern that, with the increased recognition of the rights and opportunities for women professionally, males feel threatened. The phenomenon of the `angry white male' is becoming a political reality. This is by no means confined to Australia; it is true of North America and in much of Europe as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bullets are not a substitute for words. It is a sad reflection that some men feel that if they cannot articulate their position their guns will do it for them. Incoherent male rage led to Dunblane and Port Arthur, the Oklahoma City bombing, the Manchester bombing and other acts of revenge by those who see themselves as powerless and see the gun or the bomb as an alternative means of expression. They are saying, `You can ignore me but you can't ignore my weapon. When I have a weapon in my hand, I speak with authority.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, there are many thousands who say, `The capacity to kill is integral to my sense of freedom and happiness.' There is a real hostility and lack of comprehension about those who take a different view. It is particularly disturbing to see the insistence that children must be recruited to perpetuate the gun culture. I say to the gun lobby, `Think again; don't declare war on civil society. Reject the old rhetoric of division and threat.' If the gun lobby want to run candidates, let them. That is their democratic right. I certainly hope the gun control issue can be resolved peacefully. We should avoid confrontation and encourage dialogue, where possible, but without weakening the agreement already reached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one criticism I could make of the government, it is for its late response in explaining what was intended. The documentation in the Attorney&hyphen;General's paper is very useful but I do not understand why so many weeks have gone by without making that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> position quite clear. There has been an extraordinary degree of confusion in the minds of many voters. Much of the confusion is innocent; much is the result of manipulation and deliberate misinformation. But here we have a great opportunity to speak for the parliament&mdash;to speak with one voice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very anxious not to offend against the 10&hyphen;minute limitation which seems to have been informally agreed on. I will simply say that on behalf of other members of parliament I express my sense of outrage and horror at the intimidatory pressure that has been put on some of our colleagues. It is an absolute, unmitigated disgrace. The people associated with it ought to recognise what damage they are doing to their own cause and to the cause of democracy in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The appalling massacre of 35 Australians at Port Arthur naturally created widespread community dismay, and demands for a much tougher approach to gun ownership soon followed. As a consequence, at a meeting of federal and state ministers in Canberra on 10 May agreement was reached to implement the toughest gun laws our nation has ever known. The new laws are very severe. The new licensing requirements will create inconvenience for thousands of innocent gun owners who have purchased their firearms for legitimate purposes and have always used them carefully.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new laws will substantially increase bureaucracy and impose rigorous new procedures at a time when the government is actively pursuing reduction in business regulation and seeking to slash paperwork. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has frequently acknowledged the imposition being placed on people, particularly in regional areas. There is, however, strong public support, particularly in the capital cities, for the government's position. The Prime Minister has appointed a government committee to work through the details of the agreed new arrangements in an endeavour to ensure that the impact of the new regulations is fair, equitable and justifiable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will ultimately be a matter for each state to determine the precise nature of their laws. I welcome their resolve to work towards uniform and common standards. There has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2019"> been a great deal of opposition in my own electorate to tighter gun laws, with letters and calls to my office overwhelmingly opposed to the government's proposals. The gun debate has pushed the city of Gympie in my electorate to national prominence as a result of the remarks of one or two individuals at one of the first pro&hyphen;gun meetings held in the city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Gympie is no red&hyphen;necked capital of Australia, as suggested by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. It is an attractive, peace&hyphen;loving country city with friendly and welcoming people. The speaker who received national notoriety because of his comments in Gympie was a visitor to the town. His comments embarrassed law&hyphen;abiding gun owners and tarnished the reputation of responsible sportsmen and firearm users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I completely reject the outrageous claims of some of those on the extremes of the pro-gun lobby, although we should not forget that some of the strong language and irrational statements have come also from those who want to eliminate firearms altogether. The Gympie bowls club, which hired out its meeting room to the Gympie anti&hyphen;gun rally, subsequently received threats of violence from those who want no-one to own guns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gympie is like every Australian town: it is sick and tired of violence, petty crime, vandalism and social decline. If Port Arthur were to be the catalyst for the implementation of a new and wholesome vision for Australia, then the lives lost would not be in vain. Governments can vary laws and provide a positive environment for social improvement. But only when people themselves are wholeheartedly convicted with the determination and willingness to create a better world will Australia be radically different from the way it was before Port Arthur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our reply to the Port Arthur tragedy must be comprehensive and not limited to the emotive issue of gun ownership. Guns are instruments sometimes used in crime, but rarely are they the cause of crime. New gun laws will not eliminate evil and will not, of themselves, put an end to violent killing. The Port Arthur massacre began with a knife.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, the last figures available, firearms were used in just 17 per cent of murders, 24 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent of attempted murders, nine per cent of manslaughters, 13 per cent of robberies and 0.1 per cent of sexual assaults. Of the 522 Australians who were killed by firearms in 1994, 420 were suicides, but firearms accounted for only 30 per cent of all suicides.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Perhaps the appallingly high level of suicide in our nation, particularly in rural areas, is an even more poignant commentary on our society than Port Arthur is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our nation needs to deal with the social and economic causes of despair and crime in our community, including family failure, unemployment, breakdown in community values and lack of respect for fellow citizens. If we all gave more time to care for one another and help for those in need, our society would be a much less violent place. Port Arthur raises, again, some specific issues such as mental health care and excessive violence in the media which clearly must be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that it is time for a total ban on extreme violence in videos and movies. There have been many recorded cases&mdash;and perhaps Port Arthur is one&mdash;where the carrying out of horrific crime has been linked with watching violence. The graphic illustration and Hollywood&hyphen;style glorification of mass killing, brutal murder, torture and horror should have no place in the homes of Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent American study suggested that children between the ages of two and five years watch over 27 hours of television per week. By the time children in the United States become high school seniors, they will have spent approximately 14,000 hours in school and 20,000 hours viewing television programs. Another study has reported that there are, on average, five violent acts per hour during prime time programming on television. This means that children are likely to have watched 100,000 acts of violence on television, including 8,000 murders, by the time they have finished primary school. A large study of teenage boys in London in 1978 showed that those who watched above average hours of television violence were responsible for almost 50 per cent more serious acts of violence than those who viewed below average quantities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2020">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Australia imports many of its television programs from the US and UK, the statistics in this country are likely to be similar. Contrast the many hours spent watching television with the average five minutes per day that children spend in meaningful conversation with their mother and the average five minutes per week they spend in meaningful conversation with their father and it becomes very clear what the major influences are on social development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government has appointed a cabinet committee to review the issue of video and television violence. I hope it will have the courage to make the very tough decisions needed. It is not good enough just to defer excessive violence to late night viewing; like child pornography, it should be banned altogether. Television news services also sometimes exceed the bounds of propriety. Evening and daytime news services should not just be a compilation of murders, motor vehicle accidents and horror stories. Such news bulletins provide a totally distorted view of normal life in a civilised country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a nation we must break the cycle and culture of violence in Australia. Aggressive and violent television heroes provide the wrong kind of role model for growing children. With so many fatherless families in our nation, the only male images many boys get to know and admire are the violent actors they see on television. The music they listen to contains too many violent lyrics and unwholesome themes. When generation after generation is exposed to a visual diet of unnatural violence, is it any wonder that our society has changed and has even started to regard violence as normal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reducing the number of firearms in the community will certainly help to lower the number of firearm incidents. There will obviously be fewer accidents involving firearms, fewer murders, fewer suicides and fewer shootings. Of course, those who have a premeditated ill intent will maintain access to firearms&mdash;criminals manage to find the tools that they need for their trade. But tougher legislation will certainly help to stop the spontaneous acts which so often lead to tragedy, injury or death.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The police ministers' agreement allows the retention of firearms by people with a genuine reason for owning them, including farmers and professional shooters who need their firearms for occupational reasons. It also includes those who have a love of sporting shooting, those who shoot at targets and those who are involved in recreational firearm use. I think it is appropriate that there should be firearms available for those people. For many of them, particularly at an occupational level, their firearm is as important as the saw or hammer is for a carpenter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in the exceptions that are available, I find it ironic that there is a concession that will enable people to import, in order to make movies, firearms which Australians are not allowed to own. There seems to be something of a conflict in values if someone is allowed to import a firearm that no Australian can own so that same firearm can be used to make a film, presumably a violent film. Frankly, if we were serious about violence, we would be stamping out violent films and we would not be allowing this concession for firearms that no Australian can own or use. The priority seems rather strange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill that we are dealing with tonight provides funding for compensation, and I certainly support the legislation. Whilst I think it is perhaps not quite appropriate to use the Medicare legislation, which is really designed to provide financial support for health issues, it is an appropriate way of ensuring that all Australians will contribute towards the compensation that rightly must be paid to those whose firearms are to be seized. If there is to be a recall program, then all Australians should contribute to the cost. This legislation will help to ensure that happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The compensation the government needs to provide should be set at pre Port Arthur market values, and the compensation needs to go not only to the owners of banned firearms but also to those who may have a firearm quite legitimately at the present time but who will not be able to own that firearm in the future. Whilst it can be said that those firearms can be sold to somebody else in the marketplace, the fact is that market will largely disappear because there will be a large <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2021"> number of firearms available and very few people who will be able to buy. Indeed, some of those who may be seeking to buy one of these now illegal firearms may well have received compensation for the sale of a more powerful automatic or semiautomatic firearm and would seek to buy a new firearm anyhow. All of those people whose rights are diminished as a result of this legislation clearly ought to be entitled to compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill puts in place the only Commonwealth legislation that will be required to implement the police ministers' resolutions at the meeting in Canberra on 10 May. It will be up to the states to draft for their parliaments appropriate legislation to carry out the spirit of those resolutions. But as a nation, there is much more we need to do in response to the Port Arthur massacre than rest on our laurels with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an urgent need to devote more of our national resources to the support of families and the restoration of community values. Much more needs to be done to identify people in crisis and to assist those with mental illnesses. However, no amount of government intervention can be an adequate substitute for the nurture and support of a loving family and a caring community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our nation must equip its citizens with the strength of character to stand up for what is right, to overcome disappointments and hardships when they arise, and to help and befriend those in need. The incident at Port Arthur was a great tragedy for all Australians but it can lead to some good. It is up to the parliaments of Australia to do what they can to ensure that the appropriate kind of environment is put in place to help build a safer and more secure Australia. </PARA></SPEECH>

They are composed of important measures because they spring from the horror of the events at Port <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Arthur and, as such, I support them unreservedly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reform of the system of gun control has been debated for many years. As the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) touched upon, reform has been toyed with&mdash;I emphasise that&mdash;by federal and state governments of all political hues, yet it is only after the Port Arthur massacre and as a result of the agreement of the states at the meeting convened by the Prime Minister on 10 May that we see measures such as these before the national parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important element of tighter gun control is a 12&hyphen;month amnesty and a compensation scheme commencing on 1 July this year. Guns such as self&hyphen;loading rifles, pump&hyphen;action shotguns and self&hyphen;loading shotguns will be banned under the new arrangements. Owners of these guns, licensed or otherwise, will need to hand them in to the relevant authorities. It is expected that the cost of the compensation package will be in the order of half a billion dollars and will be paid for by a one&hyphen;off 12&hyphen;month increase in the Medicare levy. We all accept that the $500 million estimate of the cost of compensation is very much a stab in the dark but we also expect&mdash;reasonably I believe&mdash;that it will be the end of the need for the special raising of revenue for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Medicare levy is to increase by 0.2 per cent from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent of gross income. Members of the defence forces who are currently exempt from the Medicare levy will pay only the increment of 0.2 per cent. All this is important because all Australians need to shoulder the cost of reducing the number of guns in our community. Most accept that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is arguable but on the whole I agree that the Medicare levy will be the most equitable and efficient means of raising the $500 million required. It is interesting to note that in 1995&hyphen;96, according to the most recent budget papers, the Medicare levy will raise a total of $3.6 billion. As such it will contribute to overall Medicare outlays&mdash;which for 1995&hyphen;96 are $11.34 billion&mdash;and a total health budget throughout the nation in the vicinity of $18.42 billion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2022">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to interject a view into the debate&mdash;after all, it concerns the adjustment of the Medicare levy&mdash;and ask the question: isn't it time that transparency in the overall cost of Medicare was introduced? Shouldn't taxpayers know their real contribution to the Medicare bill? The Medicare levy, in my opinion, should reflect the true cost of Medicare outlays. At present, only 31.7 per cent of Medicare outlays are actually covered by the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my very strong view, the Medicare levy should be increased to reflect the real cost of Medicare outlays and income taxes and the rates that govern them should be cut accordingly to offset the increase in Medicare levies so there is no overall increase in the total tax take. That might appear to be picking at the edges, but it is important, in my opinion, that taxpayers be aware of how much of their hard&hyphen;earned dollars go towards paying the Medicare bill and the total health costs of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much the same situation occurs in the United Kingdom where taxpayers pay their nine per cent national insurance contribution to meet the cost of welfare pensions and the medical system. If taxpayers are to make decisions about who they will vote for in elections in terms of health policy and tax policy, they should have the knowledge of where their taxes are going. Increasing the Medicare levy to reflect the real cost of Medicare would provide such important data and the necessary transparency of which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) makes such a virtue in another context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I want to get back to what the Prime Minister had to say. In his second reading speech he made it clear that gun control in Australia is essentially a matter for state and territory governments. Nevertheless, it is a matter of such national interest that the Commonwealth is prepared to offer this financial assistance to the states and territories to make certain gun control reform is a possibility and is realised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The determination of the Prime Minister and the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) to enact tighter gun control measures is therefore unequivocally highly commendable. They <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have not only made the correct decision but they have also stood firm against the lunacy of some extremists in the gun lobby. Some members of that lobby have been spreading misinformation far and wide. The honourable member for Lalor and others touched upon that in their remarks. They, and we, should do what we can to counteract the lies being perpetrated by that extremist&mdash;or ill&hyphen;informed&mdash;minority of the Australian population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more radical elements within the gun lobby are, in my view, quite clearly un&hyphen;Australian. They believe they have the right to bear arms. They do not. The right to bear arms is largely the importation of an American ideal&mdash;or idea, I am not sure which&mdash;spread far and wide by the US National Rifle Association. We do not need the importation of American ideas and concepts any more than we need the importation of American semiautomatic or military weapons which have never had any cultural tradition here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also do not want to see the spread of the American gun culture in this great country of ours. The end result of such a development would be, inevitably, more violence in our streets, more Port Arthurs, more Hoddle Streets, more Strathfields and more Queen Streets. So the list goes on. We must&mdash;and I am pleased to see that we are acting now&mdash;put a stop to the madness. But, as has already been said by others, what is proposed is not a guarantee that Hoddle Street or Port Arthur&mdash;or even for that matter a Dunblane&mdash;cannot happen again in this country. It is not an end in itself, but a contribution to minimising the possibility of isolated cases of mass murder. Other factors need examination in the cases of the mayhem of an unstable few in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no qualifications in supporting this bill and I am pretty sure I will not have any in supporting any subsequent bill to the extent that it deals with gun control in the context announced by the Prime Minister and the government. I am pleased to see that all parties in the parliament support it, including my Independent colleagues, as far as I am aware. So it is pleasing to see that all state and territory governments supporting the need <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2023"> for gun control have maintained to some extent or other their resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch on something that has been dealt with comprehensively by previous speakers. It is to query&mdash;because I put it no higher than that&mdash;the role of the media and how it might contribute to the minimisation of mass murder, which gun controls will undoubtedly do. I do not pretend to know all the answers. No-one would. As someone who is conscientiously opposed to censorship in any of its forms I have a real conflict in my mind. It is the conflict we all get when we start to think about moral issues and talk about passing laws based on moral issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: I do not pretend to know the answers. But let me say this without qualification: anyone who has read a book and got an idea from that book cannot doubt the importance of the printed word. Books and the printed word were once the repository of ideas. Now to add to that single dimension is film, including television, in its various forms. In many ways, because of the impression it can create on the young, it is arguably more important. I liked a reference I read. Unfortunately I cannot remember who is responsible so I will not go to the trouble of not attributing someone else's idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comment of someone in the advertising business or media generally was that if people wanting to sell a product out there decide to spend X million dollars to promote a product on television, you can be damned sure they are not doing it to waste their money. The fact that they can do that on television would indicate to me and to any reasonable person that there is at least some case for looking at what is shown on television&mdash;and I do not mean only in prime time, as the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) qualified his remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is a terribly difficult proposition for me because you are looking at the possibility of balancing censorship of the vast, almost total, majority and acts of unpredictable behaviour by a mentally unstable few. Unfortunately there are circumstances&mdash;Port Arthur demonstrates it and so do the other infamous cases to which I and others have referred earlier in the debate&mdash;which force you to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conclusion that the importance of the media cannot be ignored. I found it distasteful, and in my judgment&mdash;without intrinsic or other evidence to support my view&mdash;the media, particularly the printed media, spent too much time in what I would describe as wallowing in the events of Port Arthur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have absolutely no argument, but some reservations, about the media reporting diabolical events such as that. But to make a feature of it day after day and to give six&hyphen;page spreads in practically every newspaper in this country makes me wonder what that tiny, unstable few might think about that and how it might influence their behaviour. I have absolutely no evidence for reaching a conclusion that people might be influenced by those events. But my life's experience, for what it's worth, suggests to me that they could not fail to be. If these guys think that 15 minutes is all they are allocated in their lifetime to achieve fame, that might be all they need. And there is enough anecdotal if not intrinsic evidence to suggest that there may be some basis for that belief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, all that aside, I conclude by saying it is only due to the shock of Port Arthur and the resolve of the Prime Minister and his government, and his Attorney&hyphen;General, that these reforms are now becoming a reality. I am grateful for the support that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the opposition party have been able to afford that. I should observe that it is a matter to me&mdash;and I am sure to most people&mdash;of profound regret that so many people had to die for tighter gun controls to be properly addressed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to prolong the debate on this subject. I would have happily not spoken on it were it not for the fact that it was brought home with some brutality in my own backyard, so to speak, only last week. A gun lobby rally was held in my electorate, which also happens to fall into the state electorate of the Premier of Queensland, the Hon. Rob Borbidge, which was addressed by a number of people including certain state and federal members of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was not invited to that rally. I read about it in the newspaper and I could, of course, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2024"> like any other citizen have gone along but I chose not to. In fact, I was out of town but I chose not to cancel my out of town engagement in order to go to it. I therefore will accept absolutely no criticism from the gun lobby along the lines of a lack of interest in the subject and I shall certainly accept no criticism from the gun lobby when the rally which the citizens of the Gold Coast are organising for 14 July does not invite certain other people to it. They will be able to come, like other members of the public, having read about it in today's newspaper or somewhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I will invite the so&hyphen;called silent majority for once in their life to give two hours of their life to something they claim they believe in very strongly. On 14 July an organisation which has been put together fairly hastily, because we never anticipated we would need to do it, will hold a rally which will involve all political parties and quite a number of community organisations. I want to pay tribute to the National Party of Australia, the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Greens on the Gold Coast who have very promptly responded. It is not my intention to engage in any exercise of self&hyphen;promotion through this rally. I will not speak. Nowhere will my name appear. But these people have, on faith, accepted my assurance and will come along and put their shoulders to the wheel to try to do something in which they believe. That, to me, is an absolutely unique experience in politics, that people of very different political persuasions can be brought together. People who only three months ago were going at one another tooth and nail will come together in goodwill and in faith on an issue. Why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not an expert on all these types of guns that people are talking about but I have had in my life my own particular experience of guns. There was a time when I used to keep company with people who did enjoy guns and who shot at things. Just for fun one time, because I was invited to, I took a rifle and shot at something. I found I had a small amount of skill. Thereafter I used to do the target practice things that one does for fun. I did not take it very seriously and I used to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pride myself at being able to sit on a log out in the bush and, at quite some distance, hit a matchbox. I thought I was pretty clever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One day, on one of these excursions, we came upon some ducks on a dam. Because I happened to have a rifle in my hand, one of my companions said, `Why don't you aim at one of them?' So I did, and I shot it. I will never forget the feeling of revulsion that swept through me as I said to myself, `Why did I do that? Why did I shoot that duck? It was not doing anything to me. It was perfectly happy with its companions on the dam, and I killed it.' The explanation is that, in an instant, that rifle became not something which gave me some entertainment; it became something that killed. That is the great divide on rifles. It is the great divide, I believe, between men and women and their attitudes on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have eaten wild ducks that have been shot. They taste awful. It does not matter how expertly they are cooked, they taste awful. No matter how much I wanted to please the person who had shot them so that I could have a meal of duck, I could not do anything other than say, `No, I don't want any more, thank you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a time when people needed to hunt in this country. It was not so long ago in some cases when shooting duck or rabbit was how the family ate. We are not so many generations removed from that. If people needed to shoot a wild animal in order to eat, then I could understand it. But I think there are precious few people in Australia today who need to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the need to shoot feral pigs, deer and kangaroos under certain circumstances for particular reasons, but I do not understand the need to kill for the sake of killing. That may be because I am a woman. That may be because I do not have the hunter's instinct. I know that a lot of men do, and they see nothing wrong with it. There is not anything wrong with it per se, but it is not necessary. When stacked up in the debate today in Australia, in the atmosphere and in the light of the events that have brought this particular debate on, there is no contest.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2025">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, like every other member, have received many very genuine letters on the subject. People have been saying that this is wrong and that it is an overreaction. I have been in conversations with people who have pleaded with me that it is harmless&mdash;and it is. It is not a heinous crime to go and shoot a duck, but it is not a necessary part of our existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, like a lot of older Australians, I have seen in recent decades a shift in our culture, in the attitude of using weapons and their role in society, and in what we tolerate. We tolerate weapons in what we look at. First of all this was in films and television, and now it is in video games, which I have never seen but have had described to me&mdash;and I do not like the sound of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the average Australian feels a certain diffidence about expressing their negative feelings on this&mdash;the feeling that maybe they are just old fashioned, like me; that maybe there is not any harm in it. All of a sudden it seems that these things have come together. All of a sudden there is harm in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate when many people say, `You can't label everybody who wants to have guns without having to register or be answerable and who wants to have as many as they like or whatever type they like, because they are not killers and they do not want to be blamed.' I appreciate their resentment of what they think is a labelling of them. I want to reassure them that it is not a labelling of them. The problem is that you cannot label anybody in this society today as potentially a perpetrator of the acts at Port Arthur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> That diffidence that we felt that allowed more and more violent films in theatres or on television, which was done with a feeling of goodwill, of live and let live&mdash;an Australian characteristic&mdash;has gone too far. I have some familiarity with the American culture. My husband is a very proud American, although he is now an Australian citizen. He served his country as member of the United States Marines throughout World War II in the Pacific and again in Korea. He was in the first landing the US Marines made in the Pacific at Guadalcanal. He went through all the horrors of several very well-known marine <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> engagements of the Pacific war. He was, by the way, aged 14 when he landed at Guadalcanal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was recalled against his will by President Truman to go to Korea. He fought in some very bloody and well-known battles there, including the battle of the Hwachon Reservoir, which was a horror&mdash;he was taken as a prisoner of war&mdash;but he regretted none of that because he was a marine. Marines, by the way, do not call rifles `guns', and neither do their wives. He went through all of that but he has never put his hand on a gun, or a rifle, since the day he left Korea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He lived in the United States of America until 1983. He would never have guns or rifles in his home, because he knew them as killing instruments. The only comment he has made to me on this subject was when watching some of the more extremist people on television making some of their outlandish comments. With an edge of quite some bitterness in his voice that I have never heard before, he said, `They've never been ordered to blow someone away.' Keith Payne VC was reported in the newspaper a few weeks ago as saying in relation to the gun lobby, `What they need is some practice in a two-way shooting gallery.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the horror of Port Arthur and all the other terrible massacres and mass killings that we have seen happen in this country in the past 10 years is that every one of us can put ourselves in the shoes of those people. Whether we have been to Port Arthur or not, we can identify with ordinary peace&hyphen;loving Australians going to a tourist spot on a Sunday afternoon and enjoying it, and then some unmentionable horror comes in the door.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I want to mention another turning point on guns for me because it links in with that. Until five years ago, I never locked the door of my house so long as my husband was on the premises; and I always lock it now. If he is out in the yard he takes his keys with him because he is locked out as soon as he walks out the door. It is the result of an incident on the  Gold Coast where a middle&hyphen;aged couple was sitting down to lunch one day in their home when a young man walked through <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2026"> their unlocked front door and pointed a rifle at them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think most people feel that they are safe in their own homes in broad daylight. I think most women would feel that if their husbands are around no-one is going to come around. But that was another turning point for me. Whilst it might seem light years away from the Port Arthur incident, nevertheless, it is that terrible instant of understanding that, whilst it might happen 10 kilometres or 2,000 kilometres away, the fact that it happens in Australia today suggests a terrible potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Port Arthur touched a nerve in a lot of people&mdash;and not just a nerve of empathy and sympathy. There is a beginning of that undercurrent of fear in Australia. Guns are not part of our normal culture. To be confronted by someone holding a gun or a rifle is something quite foreign to nearly every Australian. The Port Arthur incident somehow brought home to people that it could happen to them. The odds might seem fairly long but it could happen, just as it happened to those poor people who were on holiday, having a pleasant Sunday afternoon, with such ghastly consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that all of us have many speeches we would like to make on this subject. There are a couple of things I will get on the record in the small amount of time available. In the course of this debate I came by a publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Citizen</EMPHASIS>. This is printed by the Citizens Electoral Council, as I recall it. I am going to seek leave to table a photocopy of the front and back pages of this newspaper. This is put out by an organisation that quite a few of us are familiar with. It runs an extraordinary theory that drugs worldwide are somehow under the control of the British. A gentleman called LaRouche who has been the victim of some awful conspiracy is mentioned throughout this publication. It states that there is a worldwide conspiracy linked in with something funny called a new world order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This edition mentions an organisation called Mont Pelerin. A number of people whom we know are listed as being involved in organisations which in some vague, shadowy way are linked with this worldwide conspiracy. On the back page under the heading `Mass murder in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Tasmania' there is the subheading `It has the hallmarks of the Tavistock Institute's&mdash;another one of these organisations&mdash;"blind terror" campaigns'. If you read through the previous 15 pages, you will find that the alleged perpetrator of this massacre&mdash;I will not mention him because I think some things are sub judice&mdash;is in some strange way an agent of all this, albeit against his will; he  has been brainwashed or manipulated in some way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will table the front and back pages simply so that there is available to people an example of the extremity of it. I have seen this sort of thing arise in other places in Australia. These people move in wherever there is trauma in a society, be it because rural industry is depressed and people are being evicted from their farms as a result of being dead broke or a town is distressed due to an industry being shut down through government policy or whatever. You will find all those issues woven through one of these publications. They move in wherever there is trauma and agitation and simple, ordinary folk are going through some extremity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are now moving in on people who are going to lose their guns or rifles, and they are saying, `Hey, you are a victim of this very simply understood conspiracy.' They give this simple, evil explanation. I have had it occur in my own electorate, as it was then, when an issue arose in relation to a multifunction polis, where government was going to compulsorily take over land and the Japanese were going to come in and build on it. I saw how they operated on good, simple, ordinary, decent Australians. They got all this poison into their minds and then away they went. These people are involved in this. I am not saying that all the people who are demonstrating are part of it, but they are being preyed on. It needs to be revealed. It needs to be something that more Australians know about. Given the interest in Australia on the subject of gun control by so many people at the moment, I hope that they will become familiar with these sorts of organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say a couple of other things very briefly. I commend the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2027"> (Mr Beazley) for the courage that they have shown. I was very interested to listen to the speech by the Leader of the Opposition on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill this evening. I thought it was a very reasonable speech. It was the sort of speech that should be made. I commend the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), who is showing a lot of courage. I commend the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot), the Greens and the Independents for falling in behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say a special word of commendation for the Premier of Queensland, Rob Borbidge, who is being put under some very unfair pressure. I want to make it clear that this man is going to go as far as is necessary in order to get the legislation put in place in Queensland. I mention it simply because there have been a couple of people in the debate tonight who have cast some sort of doubt on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming intent and feel of nearly every member of parliament in Queensland&mdash;led by Rob Borbidge, Joan Sheldon and Peter Beattie&mdash;is to get the legislation in that is wanted and required. Please do not believe anything else you hear to the contrary. I say to people, `Please don't undermine the Queensland government. It is important that we throw our bipartisan support behind those who are trying so hard to do the right thing.' I thank the House for its tolerance this evening. I seek leave to table the paper.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to initially put on the record my commendation of those people who have waged a very lonely struggle on this issue of gun control in the past few decades. After the trauma of Port Arthur, the federal parliament of this country and the state premiers have finally moved to do something on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we should put on the record that there have been people who have persisted in trying to get change in this area. There have been academics like Richard Harding and Paul Wilson. There have been the Australian Medical Association and the Bank Employees Union and its membership. There has been former Parramatta city councillor Therese <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Wood, who rang me today about the possibility of organising a demonstration in Parramatta to try to indicate that the broad majority of people in this country have a different view to the more vocal and active minority who are on the front page every week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been people like Dorothy McRae-McMahon, the Director for Mission of the Uniting Church in Australia, and the Anglican parish of St Peter's at Hornsby, which sent votergrams today. And there has been Ivan, a friend and party member in my area, who is better known as Brad Gibson. He had an untimely death last Friday evening, but he joined my party through contact with me and my own persistent activity on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been people out there who did not need the events at Milperra, Strathfield Plaza, Queen Street, Hoddle Street or Port Arthur to say that change had to occur. When the congratulations are going to the leaders of the major political parties, it should be borne in mind that when there was a lack of courage in this country amongst a variety of political leaders some people said that there was an urgent need for change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Early today I cited a few public opinion polls to drive home the reality that the mass of Australians are not affected by emotions; they are not turned around by just one traumatic event. I want to make a correction in relation to a poll held in September 1995. It was not a statewide poll; it was a plebiscite of residents of North Sydney council and there was 93 per cent support for a gun register. A 1978 Morgan poll, which I did not cite earlier today, showed that 88.8 per cent were for the registration of shotguns and .22 rifles and that 8.1 per cent were against it. Last year in New South Wales&mdash;before the Port Arthur massacre&mdash;82 per cent wanted stronger gun laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the point that has to be reiterated is that what is happening today is not totally an emotional outburst of a thoughtless and mindless need for restrictions. It is a long and sustained view of the Australian electorate that the possession of arms by so many people, the lack of restrictions, the lack of registration and the lack of controls are essentially a bad thing for this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2028">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the points that is important is the interrelationship of gun availability and the number of offences. It is worth noting the Australian Social Trends 1994 document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth Suicide</EMPHASIS>. From 1987 to 1991 it was noted that there was a very big difference in the number of deaths with guns in urban and rural areas. In the urban area only 18 per cent of deaths occurred through guns; in rural areas the figure was 42 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note the clear point&mdash;we all know this&mdash;that large urban areas create crime, that the social problems in those areas lead to a far greater incidence of offences per head of population. But in regard to the ratio of gun homicides in rural and urban areas in this country, the rate in rural areas is 13.5 per cent as against the urban figure of 13.6 per cent. Over the last 15 years there has been a 50 per cent increase in male deaths by suicide. The point is that, as I say, there is a correlation between the greater prevalence of guns in rural areas and the inclination to suicide by firearm. This is one of the few offences where the rate is commensurate with city areas. There is a clear message there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seitz, in an article in the United States, made this same point. He looked at the levels of gun ownership in different regions of the United States. In the south there was a rate of 59 to 100,000. In the north-east of the United States the rate was 33. Quite clearly, it was not coincidental that the number of accidental deaths was 2.46 to 100,000 in the south and 0.59 in the north-east. In other words, the prevalence of accidental deaths from firearms is a little under five times greater in the south, which is clearly interrelated with the greater levels of gun ownership. Also, FBI figures from 1991 showed a 15 per cent greater incidence of gun homicides in the south. Despite certain people's objections that there is no interrelationship, there is a very clear connection between the availability of arms and a number of offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier today I referred to articles by Kellermann, a United States writer in this area. I refer to a further article titled `Suicide in the home in relation to gun ownership' from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New England Journal of Medicine</EMPHASIS>. He made a few important points in that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> article, which appeared in volume 327, No. 7 of August 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1968 through 1985, the rate of suicide involving firearms increased 36 percent, whereas the rate of suicide involving other methods remained constant.9 Among adolescents and youth adults, rates of suicide by firearms doubled during the same period.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Univariate analyses revealed that the case subjects were more likely than the controls to have lived alone, taken prescribed psychotropic medication, been arrested, abused drugs or alcohol, or not graduated from high school. After we controlled for these characteristics through conditional logistic regression, the presence of one or more guns in the home was found to be associated with an increased rate of suicide . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, in the same article&mdash;as I say, it is an analysis of suicides in the United States&mdash;he made the telling point:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the question "Many people occasionally have quarrels or fights&mdash;has anyone in this household ever been hit or hurt in a fight in the home?" 13.6 percent of the case proxies answered in the affirmative, but only 3.9 percent of controls. The combination of alcohol and domestic violence was particularly striking. Almost 15 percent of case proxies reported physical fights while drinking, as compared with only 1.2 percent of matched controls.</PARA>
<PARA>The article also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Handguns were used in 72 percent of the suicides involving a firearm. In four of every five such suicides, the investigators specifically noted that the gun had been kept in the victim's home.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Other">In homes where firearms were not usually kept, only 6 percent of case subjects killed themselves with a gun. The last 172 case proxies to be interviewed were asked how long a gun had been kept in the victim's home. Only 5 of the 162 who answered (3 per cent) reported that the gun had been obtained within two weeks of the suicide.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, there is clearly a connection between the availability of guns and the prevalence of gun homicides, accidental deaths, et cetera. As we all know and many speakers have said earlier, most of these deaths occur not through the type of person the gun lobby says will always get guns&mdash;the professional criminal. We all know that those people will obtain them. Most people are killed by relations, by neighbours, by people with whom they have a close association. Kellermann further said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2029">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since both living alone and taking psychotropic medication were strongly associated with suicide but negatively correlated with gun ownership, controlling for their effects increased the apparent strength of the association between suicide and the presence of a gun in the home.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>It is one of the great myths of the gun lobby that we have all these guns around the house so that we can shoot the head off the burglar when he breaks in. The reality is that we are usually half asleep, hungover or whatever, and have no chance whatsoever to get hold of the gun&mdash;because of the element of surprise. As I said in an earlier debate, Kellermann noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For every case of self&hyphen;protection homicide involving a firearm kept in the home, there were 1.3 accidental deaths, 4.6 criminal homicides and 37 suicides involving firearms&mdash;an overall ratio of 43:1.</PARA>
<PARA>For each burglar you might happen to shoot, 43 people manage to shoot themselves or members of their family. They are not very good odds. Another study he undertook was a comparison in 1993&hyphen;94 of similar demographic households. There were 3:1 odds that, regardless of how similar these people were&mdash;whether blacks, unemployed, Hispanics, autoworkers&mdash;when all those things were held even, where a homicide was involved a gun was on the premises. Despite the denials, the reality is that there is a correlation between the availability of guns and the possibility that people will accidentally shoot themselves, and a correlation with a higher rate of suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems in this country has been that the lack of political leadership and a lack of willingness to tackle this problem have led to the proliferation of guns, not in any manner like the level in the United States but certainly at a far more worrying level than in the United Kingdom or Japan. That again is a problem because we have increasing numbers of people with a vested interest in the possession of guns and in opposing licensing and restrictions. As each year has dragged on and as each massacre has failed to move the politicians in this country, there have been more and more people with a determined self&hyphen;interest in opposing change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surveys in the United States show that the possessors of the guns are more opposed than <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those who don't possess them to any restrictions. We have to really question whether we want a society like that cited in the US News and World Report of 15 August 1994, which indicated that 37 per cent of Americans had heard a gunshot in their neighbourhood. If we want any demonstration of the political reality we can look to the United States where only 42 per cent of people in 1994 supported any kind of mandatory training; only 47 per cent said that possessing a gun creates more problems than it solves; and 22 per cent of the population said that it was quite reasonable for people to carry concealed weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The valuable time that has been lost on this issue has made the task politically far more difficult. We are seeing the kinds of pressures that particularly members in country areas are coming under because there is a connection between the gun lobby's interest in the matter and their determination to stop change. We have also seen, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> has exposed, the degree to which those people involved in importation and sales have been financing the Shooters Party. Quite clearly, that commercial interest in a growing industry represents a very big interest that stands in the way of overdue change. I support the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in ensuring that this opportunity is not lost.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to open my comments on this matter with the observation made by the National President of the ALP, the member for Lalor, Mr Barry Jones, when he spoke. Barry Jones said, `There is no Liberal, Labor, National, Democrat or Green position on this matter; there is a human position which is represented and reflected by the concern which representatives of all those political parties&mdash;and the political parties themselves, collectively&mdash;have adopted on this question. Most people have drawn attention to the fact that, in a very real way, it is a sorry reflection on members of parliament and on parliaments in Australia generally that it took a tragedy of the dimensions of that which occurred at Port Arthur for governments to steel themselves finally into doing something positive and firm about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2030">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can only speculate about the horror and fear, the feelings, the emotions had by those people at Port Arthur and others in circumstances of a similar kind over the years. I do not think anyone will forget the circumstances at Port Arthur where, for example, a mother holding her child, in the face of an approach by the gunman, appealed to him not to shoot the child and having the child killed and having herself killed; and another child, after seeing members of the family shot, attempting to hide behind a tree and, in turn, being shot. The point has been made that, in the absence of automatic and semiautomatic weapons, a massacre of that dimension simply would not and could not have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like all those who have spoken, I am delighted that members of parliament who have been subjected to quite justified criticism for many years for failing to act decisively in connection with this question have now chosen to act collectively. I saw, as most others did, either directly or indirectly, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) just last weekend address a hostile group of people in Victoria and make it perfectly clear that there would be no retreat. Let me say that members of the National Party, in particular, should take credit for the fact that they have been prepared to withstand the threats and intimidation which have been visited upon them in one way or another in their determination to join with others to ensure that effective legislation be put into place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I know that others have referred to this, but I also think it important that we place on record an outline of those more recent occasions where firearms have been used in quite horrendous circumstances to cause multiple deaths. September 6, 1971: Clifford Bartholemew killed 10 people at Hope Forest near Adelaide. September 2, 1984: seven people were killed in the car park of the Viking Tavern at Milperra, Sydney. January 23, 1987: Richard Madrell killed four teenage girls at West Pymble. June 1987: Joseph Schwab with a Rugar .223 semiautomatic rifle killed five people in a five&hyphen;day period in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. August 9, 1987: Julian Knight killed seven and wounded 19 on Hoddle Street, Mel bourne. October 11, 1987: John van Trung Tran killed five people in Canley Vale, Sydney. December 8, 1987: Frank Vitkovic killed eight and wounded 10 in Queen Street, Melbourne. April 7, 1990: Rodney Dale killed one and wounded 13 at Burleigh Heads in New South Wales. August 30, 1990: Paul Anthony Evers killed five people in Surry Hills, Sydney, with a shotgun. August 17, 1991: Wade Frankum killed seven people and wounded seven others in Strathfield, Sydney. March 28 to 30, 1993: Leonard Leabeater and two accomplices shot dead five people in northern New South Wales. And, of course, there have been those terrible circumstances at Dunblane&mdash;another event of recent occurrence. These events have caused anguish and despair on the part of so many people but, at the same time, they have caused members of parliament and governments to become even more determined that something be done about them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard people say, as all have heard them say, that it has not been guns that have killed people&mdash;people have killed people&mdash;and that in the absence of automatic and semiautomatic weapons, these mass murderers would find other means to carry out those deeds. I do not think anyone can reasonably deny that in the absence of those automatic and semiautomatic weapons, massacres on the scale that have occurred simply would not have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to mention in particular just a couple of comparative statistics which, at least prima facie, indicate the enormous additional dangers associated with the number of firearms compared with the populations of various countries. In 1994, the United States, for example, having about 250 million people, had over 39,000 deaths in one year resulting from the use of firearms. That was 40,000 deaths in one year. In Britain and Japan gun laws are much more effective and much more stringent. In Britain, with 57 million people, there were 70 gun deaths. In Japan, with 124 million people, there were 34 gun deaths. The comparison there is more than apparent. It indicates, prima facie, the additional potential for tragedies of the kind that have recently occurred. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2031">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, there is an official figure of 1.67 million registered weapons. Estimates of the number of guns in civilian hands in Australia vary from between 3.5 million and 10 million. We have all been aware of the fact that those gun shops act as conveyor belts flooding weapons of that kind into the community. If they were not selling them, they would not continue to operate. We see them full of guns. Those guns continue to flow into the community. The more civil and civilised people within the community are those who have acknowledged the reality of that and they realise that that problem exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the suggestion has also been made that, to a large extent, this question has been a media beat&hyphen;up. It is interesting to see the unanimity on the part of major newspapers. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS>, for example, referred on 5 May to those young children at Port Arthur:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last Sunday they were walking peacefully with their mother along a country road in Port Arthur, Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A man of evil pulled up in his car, gunned down their mother, Nanette, and Madeline, then chased Alannah. Alannah ran and hid behind a gum tree. But the evil man shot her down at point blank range. As a grieving nation mourns their senseless killing, and the murder of 33 others, Alannah and Madeline have become sisters to us all. We must never forget them.</PARA>
<PARA>In reference to politicians, the paper went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This paper has taken the lead in calling for tough gun control laws, with major space devoted to the issue years before the Strathfield massacre in 1991. And there is no satisfaction&mdash;just a sense of grief and anger&mdash;that it has taken another massacre, like the one at Port Arthur, to instil some sense into the well&hyphen;paid, and so&hyphen;far gutless, people in this country who call themselves politicians.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased that we will in future be able to take `gutless' out of that paragraph and out of any reference to politicians because there has been unanimous resolve not only on the part of the national government, all parties and all political interests represented in this parliament but also on the part of the state and territory parliaments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate has seen speakers range wide and far. I just want to make a few comments about this discussion. Most people in the community listening to this debate would not recognise it as the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill because people have been mainly talking about the proposal dealing with guns. One of the great things about this debate is that there has been a multipartisan approach. All the parties in this country have given a strong affirmation to the leadership given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and premiers around this country. This also illustrates the point that there has been a very strong cooperative approach between the states and the Commonwealth in regard to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite unusual that we have a multipartisan approach to a debate and also have the cooperation of the state leaders. That is very important in this debate because it gives strength and weight to the position which has been adopted since the Port Arthur tragedy, which occurred just over six or eight weeks ago.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2032">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That tragedy has brought about a step change in consciousness in the Australian people with regard to violence. The most important thing is that we now see a strengthened will, not only at the parliamentary level but also at the community level to have a clear focus on reducing violence in this country. That is a very good thing. I think the overwhelming majority of Australians feel that the level of violence that has gradually developed in our society is very unhealthy. The step change in consciousness on this issue of violence I liken very much to the step change in consciousness that surrounded environmental issues during the 1980s. In the mid&hyphen;1990s we have a step change in the consciousness within our community with regard to violence.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr MILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few more comments at this stage. The Prime Minister clearly has a multifaceted approach to dealing with this issue of violence. He is not just dealing with guns but also, with his committee, looking into violence in regard to the media, videos, CD lyrics, TV, cinema and so on. It is all part of trying to reduce the level of violence which is in our community. So it is a multifaceted approach, and people within the pro&hyphen;gun lobby have to realise that they are not the only people to which we as a government are looking to try to reduce violence within our community, that there is a multifaceted approach by the government to try to deal with the level of violence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I was saying a few moments ago, I believe the step change in consciousness within the Australian community does require a multifaceted approach by the government. I believe that it is very important that we as a parliament are resolved to ensure that the approaches adopted will actually be achieved and, therefore, will break this culture of violence which has developed within the Australian society. In that respect, I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the generous 10 minutes granted to me on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill I want to put a counter case. I remind this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> House that it was not so long ago that France resumed nuclear testing. And what happened on that occasion? The Liberal Party tried to out&hyphen;hate the Labor Party. That set off across Australia an absolute symphony of hate towards the French. Arising out of this, French property was destroyed, people were attacked and businesses were sent broke, simply because they were called French something or other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a time in Australia when I was not proud to be an Australian because every politician and every journalist in this country knew there was not one thread of a threat to Australia emanating from those tests. When the question was put they said it was not a threat; it was simply that France could not do what it liked in our part of the world. Of course, Mururoa has been French longer than Australia has been ours. If you reduce France's sovereign rights you reduce your own rights by the same amount. I am against the reduction of our sovereign rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), having done this sordid little trick to capture, as he thought, the environmental vote, when the opportunity arose again little Johnny jumped up again. This time it was to prepare the ground for the double dissolution which he intended to have this year. The gullible Labor Party followed down that track. They must have realised that they would have been decimated in even more seats if that had been allowed to occur. That will not occur now, but it is certainly not as a result of any ability on the part of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been sitting here tonight and listening to the trotting out of a lot of meaningless statistics. The facts are simple. Since 1915 when records were first kept, gun related violence has been trending down in Australia, unlike the United States where it is trending up at about three times the Australian rate. It is true that in some parts of the United States it is low. Where it is high it is always associated with socioethnic violence and crime. That is the main cause of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2033"> In 1994, the last year that statistics were kept, 400 men committed suicide, 21 using guns. We should be addressing the cause of those suicides. That is not suggested any where. If they cannot use guns they will obviously use something else, as they do elsewhere. Sweden, Switzerland and Japan all have much higher suicide rates than Australia and they do not use guns. If people want to do away with themselves they will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reasons for those suicides were simple. Economic pressure in the rural sector was a big cause. There were the failings of the Family Law Court and the inequities of the child support laws. These will not be investigated because this requires real courage on the part of a government&mdash;something that I see neither on the other side nor on this side. They are just the simple facts of the situation. In the same year, 400 men died of suicide and, I think it was, 58 men and 26 women died from armed assaults. This shows that suicide is by far the biggest factor and is not being tackled, nor will it be tackled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just consider the actions of little Johnny Howard with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, John Major&mdash;a man in desperate need of an issue. What John Howard&mdash;</PARA>

I say to this House that laws you cannot enforce are silly laws. They are bad laws. Laws that turn decent people into criminals are evil laws. And that is exactly what will happen here. These laws will not be enforceable unless there are draconian penalties, including gaol, or unless there are cash bonuses to dob in your neighbour.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And all for what? It will have no effect on the Port Arthurs at all. Everyone knows that. What this parliament is doing will have no effect in those circumstances. Good heavens! Bryant in Tasmania could not get a gun even under Tasmania's relaxed laws. It is ironic <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it is strongly suggested that the gun that he eventually got, obviously legally acquired by his parents&mdash;Bryant murdered to get it&mdash;was a gun handed in in Victoria in 1987 and the police have since admitted that many other guns handed in in Victoria have been put back on the market. Registries do not work. That is absolutely clear. What governments should be doing is compiling lists of people who should not have guns.</PARA>

If we look at the facts, we see that this legislation is going to further divide rural and urban Australia. The great problem facing Australia is that this divide is increasing in dimension. It is increasing at a rate because the National Party is, of course, a city based organisation. It is now, I guess, the mange on the coat of the Liberal Party. They are going to suffer for their betrayal of country people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make no mistake&mdash;the National Party was finished before this gun action.

The same cannot be said of the Labor Party because they no longer have a country constituency. They blew it in the last election. I say to this House: you will rue this day. You will regret the passage of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were lots of things that Howard could have done. Had he negotiated he could have got the Western Australian legislation forced across Australia. The Western Australian legislation, I think, was good legislation and it would have been all that was necessary. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2034"> The Prime Minister, advised by his Sydney advisers, rushed this action. There was no consultation with gun owners. Had he sought the support of gun owners he could have recalled all the military type rifles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, we see this attack on rim&hyphen;fire rifles and shotguns. Shooting is a working class sport in this country, unlike in other countries, and those are the people who of course will be penalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister went down to talk to the gun rally complete with armoured vest. People say, `What does this say about Australia?' It says nothing. It says a lot about what John Howard thinks about Australia. The truth is that that rally was probably the safest place he could have been. Anyone producing a gun at that rally would have been eaten alive. But he wore his vest prominently enough so that the press could pick it up and he could make some other statement about what he thinks about the state of Australia. It is a scandal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister spoke glibly about his preparedness to meet the electoral consequences, knowing full well that the present government and a future Labor government could survive on the votes of Melbourne and Sydney&mdash;towns that intrinsically produce nothing, no wealth. I say to this House that every city in Australia exists because of the wealth of the hinterland. But the hinterland is being continually downgraded; its infrastructure is wearing out and not being replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are getting this city view of the world. I had a woman say to me, `As a compromise, couldn't farmers leave their guns at the police station and go and get them when they needed them?' It gives you an idea of the lack of knowledge that we now have in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One hundred years ago this was the most urban country in the world. Today it is even more so. The difference is that 40 or 50 years ago people in the cities understood the country. That understanding has gone and been replaced by massive ignorance. The city is still understood by the country because the country has to go there; but the city suffers massive ignorance of the country&mdash;a situation that is becoming increasingly apparent.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to this House: this nation will not survive as a nation divided against itself on the basis of city&hyphen;country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to talk about the fact that we had this very recent Port Arthur tragedy that galvanised the Australian population into demanding action. We saw gung&hyphen;ho laws in some states that allowed military style rapid fire guns to enter the arena. So our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) received the grateful thanks of Australians when he provided the leadership which resulted in minimum conditions for safer gun laws throughout Australia. But when these are translated into state legislation it will mean that a number of guns which people currently hold legally and which a number of people currently shoot legally will become non&hyphen;lawful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, as part of this final discussion, I believe the country really does have a great need to look carefully at the compensation issues. We have made a major move today to amend the Medicare levy act. We are saying that in a one&hyphen;off situation half a billion dollars will be raised to be redistributed to the lawful population of Australia who will be disadvantaged. The armed forces will also be included in this measure. So tonight I commend the Prime Minister who has taken a statesmanlike approach in identifying the minimum standards and conditions for firearms control. It is now over to the states to pass the regulations. At the federal level he has also ensured that the law&hyphen;abiding community of Australians, who overwhelmingly in regional areas are also gun owners, will be fully compensated. It is essential that this compensation be paid fairly and effectively.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to deal with Club Marconi and Bossley Park where the club stands as a symbol in western Sydney. It is right in the heart of my electorate. It is a symbol of success of which we can all be proud, yet there are people who wish to denigrate it, who wish to attack its standing in the community and, as such, attack the community from which it gains its support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of members would be aware that the Marconi Club, apart from being famous for its community service, is prominent in Australian sporting circles via its excellent and continuing contribution to Australian soccer. On 13 June, the Chairman of the Marconi Fairfield soccer team, Mr Frank Baroni, received a fax from the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Soccer Federation, Mr David Woolley, outlining the terms and conditions to be met by Marconi <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Fairfield if it is to be included as a participant in the 1996-97 Ericsson Cup season. After making several reasonable requests of Club Marconi, Mr Woolley then went straight for the jugular. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as part of a National Merchandising Plan programmed to commence with the 1996/97 season, all clubs shall be obliged to remove all symbols of European nationalism from club logos, playing strips, club flags, stadium names and letterheads.</PARA>
<PARA>This translates to a demand that, after 36 years of serving the nation, the Marconi Club's soccer team must not only remove the inoffensive club insignia from its players' uniforms and merchandising but, worst of all, it must change its name because it supposedly pays too candid a nod to its European roots. The price Marconi will pay for failure to adhere to the federation's demands is exclusion from competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have here is a veiled threat of blackmail from the Australian Soccer Federation. They are saying, `Do it, or else.' They are telling that to the thousands of Club Marconi members and the even greater numbers of Australians who support the club's soccer teams&mdash;which, incidentally, finished as winners in the junior competition and runners up in the senior competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take a look at the symbol, and I have brought it into the House so all can see it. Let us take a look at how supposedly nationalistic it really is. The Marconi symbol is a boomerang striped in red, green and white on a globe of the world with a communications tower. It symbolises the people's hope and trust in travelling to their new country, Australia. It symbolises the confidence that led the club's founders to abandon their previous lives and take their chances in a foreign country, which has given so much to them and to which they have endeavoured to repay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And the name that they have to remove? Guglielmo Marconi's name graces the club and its soccer team because he too had strong links with Australia. On 26 March 1930, Marconi, as he sat on board his boat in the harbour at Genoa, pushed a button which lit the lights of Sydney Town Hall 11,000 miles away&mdash;an amazing feat for that time. Again, his name can be seen as symbolising the link <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2036"> between one country and another, the connection between the old and the new. The Italians who founded the club were Club Marconi's spark, but the energy is now provided by thousands from all different walks of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Marconi's name and insignia are not a blind idolatry of a foreign European past. The club's beginnings were undeniably Italian, but now its membership crosses all ethnic boundaries. In one of Australia's most multicultural centres, Marconi's prosperity stands as a symbol of its continued success in appealing to all sections of our society, not just the Italian. The demands placed on Marconi by the Australian Soccer Federation in relation to its name and symbol are either a poorly thought out exercise in political correctness or a vindictive attempt by the federation, led by David Hill, to subject the club to the pettiness and the whims of its officials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask Mr Hill and Mr Woolley: which is it? Will you recognise the errors of your way in making this request of Club Marconi or will you proceed with this campaign based on spite against a successful club and teams which have enriched the lives of thousands of Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Australian Soccer Federation does proceed in pressing for these ludicrous demands to be met, then you can be sure that Club Marconi and the people of western Sydney will fight Mr Hill all the way. Nor will they ever forgive him for the animosity he has shown and the rancorous fashion in which he has pursued and attempted to discredit this bastion of the west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Club Marconi's founders came together, led by Michelini, they had a vision, and I would like to put their vision on the record of this place. It was to have a place, equal to any other part of the land, where they and their families could come and enjoy themselves, a place where they could not only be proud of their heritage but also appreciate a nation which allowed them the opportunity to work to create a home and a future for themselves, their families and their friends. Their vision is now a reality and has been shared by countless other Australians since our club was founded in 1958.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Hill will tell you that I have a particular interest in this club. That is correct. I have been a member since 1959 and I was the first woman named a life member of this club. But I say to Mr Hill and to the Soccer Federation that if they take these steps and take the matter further in blackmailing Club Marconi by saying that they will be removed from the Soccer Federation unless they remove their name from their symbols and their letterhead, I too will go to the racial discrimination board. I believe that what they are doing is not only blackmail but racial discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a country which can be so proud of what it has achieved in these past 200 years with its ethnic population, how can we then turn around and say to a club, which for 36 years has made such a wonderful contribution not only to the community but, as I have said before, to soccer and to young people in our area, that it has to front up without the name `Marconi' or get out of the league?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I questioned what else they were upset about, it was the fact that the boomerang which we so cleverly designed to go on the map of the world has&mdash;dreadful, dreadful!&mdash;the colours of the Marconi flag: red, green and white. If that has got to be removed, South Sydney's football colours, which are the same, should be removed as well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I felt it was important to rise tonight to respond to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who has continued to mislead the people of Australia with the rhetoric he goes on with regarding the guns legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is most enlightening to all of us is that he and maybe one other person in this entire House, on both sides of the parliament, spruik the same message that he has been spreading, which means that we have something like 146 to two in this place, which is pretty much representative of this debate in Australia. Unfortunately, those two seem to be very noisy but have very little to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, I would like to clear up why this legislation has been brought in. It is John Howard, the Prime Minister&mdash;not `Little <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2037"> Johnny', as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie likes to refer to him in his typically arrogant manner&mdash;who has demonstrated leadership and shown the rest of Australia what is necessary to make Australia a safer place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is not designed so that the gun owner, the person who likes to go shooting at the weekend or any other member of the public is going to be disarmed. It is designed for that unfortunate set of circumstances when a person who is deranged at a moment in time and has had no prior mental illness has the motivation, the depression and quite often the alcohol or some other substance on board and then has access to the weapon with which he is able to carry out such mass destruction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislating so that people can have semiautomatic rifles registered and so that the person owning them can be registered is absolutely pointless because, as the member for Kalgoorlie pointed out, the gentleman who carried out the Hoddle Street massacre&mdash;and I use the term `gentleman' rather liberally&mdash;and the man who was responsible for the Port Arthur massacre did not own the weapons but secured them from a third party. Therefore, if we had bothered to legislate to have those rifles not banned but owned legally, those men still would have had access to the semiautomatic rifle which created this carnage and we would still have ended up with as many dead people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is about time the member for Kalgoorlie and one or two other members of this place who take delight in going around this country inciting people unnecessarily, forcing upon them mis&hyphen;truths and misrepresentations about the resolutions of the police meeting, did themselves a lot of good and sat back, pulled their heads in and had a good, long think about what they are doing. They are the ones that are being destructive; they are the ones that are taking away the leadership in this nation. If they, just for once, took a good look at themselves, looked at the good of the nation and then presented logical arguments, this would be a much better place in which to do business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I met members of the Sporting Shooters Association in my area and spent an hour with them. At the end of that meeting, they concluded that they were quite happy with the way they see things going. It is only the loony fringe, not the mainstream gun or shooters elements&mdash;that very small percentage of the population&mdash;that is disturbed by what is going on. It is using this for its own political means, not because it is concerned about the rights of Australians or their ability to defend themselves; those rights have not been undermined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the one or two people who continue to rave on in this lunatic fashion refrain from doing so in future and look at what the Prime Minister has put up and see that it has been and will continue to be supported by the overwhelming majority of the Australian public. If we get this legislation approved by the states in the form proposed, this country will be a safer place. People will be able to go forward into the future feeling that Australia will not go down the path of the United States. That can only make our country a better place to live in.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<ELECTORATE> (Brisbane)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.56 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to place on record a few comments on the tragic incident last Wednesday evening in Townsville where two Black Hawk helicopters collided during an exercise, causing the loss of 18 service personnel lives. On Wednesday night, we lost 18 of the finest Australians in the service: 15 Special Air Service Regiment troopers and three from the 5 Aviation Regiment involved in crewing the Black Hawk helicopters. These people stretch the limits of physical and emotional endurance as part of their regular training. That they should lose their lives in exercises designed to provide security for the rest of us is a matter of grave concern for all of us. It is, though, above all else a personal tragedy for the families and the loved ones of those who died and those who remain injured. I believe that three are still in critical care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it is first and foremost a matter of grief for the families and the loved ones, and our hearts are quite properly with them, it is a matter of grief for the nation that people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2038"> who in the normal course of their work place their lives in jeopardy should die on an exercise designed to ensure that those of us in the wider community are able to exercise our freedoms without threat to life and property. That grief, which has been so evident around the Australian community and which was exhibited earlier today in the memorial service here in Canberra, may provide some comfort to those closest to the victims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want in the few short moments available to me tonight to also place on record my admiration for the bravery of those people who were at the site. When the two helicopters collided, miraculously the pilot of the second helicopter managed to get that helicopter to ground upright without a tail rotor or a good part of its tail. That demonstrated an enormous amount of skill under the most unimaginable sorts of pressures. At the time the helicopters were something like 50 metres above the ground. You can contemplate the time in which those events transpired. Without the skill of Captain Burke I fear that the death toll would have been worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bravery at the site at the time of the crash is also worthy of mention. Troops, including safety officers, were on the ground as part of the exercise. Other helicopters that were in the air as part of the exercises came to the rescue. The first helicopter burst into flames on impact, and the second burst into flames shortly thereafter. There was live ammunition on both. It was a live exercise of the sort the SAS is used to conducting. Those people involved in the rescue were not just in a burning environment but in one where live shells were going off everywhere. The dedication, skill, bravery and sheer heroism that those people on the ground displayed should make all Australians proud of our defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to acknowledge publicly my thanks to the Chief of the Defence Force and the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) for the way in which they responded so rapidly to the crisis. The CDF was in Townsville in the early hours of the morning following the accident. I also thank and congratulate the paramedics involved in the rescue at the site and those at the Townsville General <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Hospital who performed a wonderful task. I know that it was greatly appreciated by the survivors and their families.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr Wooldridge</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 (the Act) was proclaimed on 7 February 1990 and the Commission commenced operations on 5 March 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) ATSIC's representative arm consists of 35 Regional Councils (s92 of the Act refers). Regional Councils have between 10 and 20 members, depending on the population of each region, with a total of 573 councillors nationally. They are independent bodies which meet at least four times a year. A Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson for each Regional Council are elected by the members of the Regional Council. The position of the Chairperson is salaried and full&hyphen;time (s127 of the Act refers). The Act also provides for functions of the Regional Council (s94) and powers (s95).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regional Councillors and the members of the Torres Strait Regional Authority elect a total of 17 Commissioners, one for each ATSIC Zone including the Torres Strait Zone. Two Commissioners are appointed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Chairperson is chosen by the Minister from among the 19 Commissioners (s27). All Commissioners are full&hyphen;time. The Commission's functions are detailed in s7 and powers are in s10 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC's administration is divided into three tiers, with a Central Office in Canberra, State Offices in every capital city, and 27 Regional Offices. The administration supports the activities of the Regional Councils and Commissioners and assists in policy formulation and program administration (s55). The administrative arm of the Commission is headed by a Chief Executive Officer (s45&hyphen;54).</PARA>
<PARA><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2045"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)(a) The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs appoints two Commissioners and then the Chairperson from amongst the 19 Commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Regional Council elections are held each three years. They are run by the Australian Electoral Commission. Voting is by secret ballot and is not compulsory. The proportional representation system of voting is used. This assists smaller communities to obtain a representative on Regional Councils. After declaration of the polls for Regional Councillors, elections are then held for the position of Commissioner within each Zone. The Minister then formally appoints the elected person to be a Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Full rounds of ATSIC Regional Council elections were held on 3 November 1990 and 4 December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The number of candidates who stood in each region in each of the elections of the 1993 round of Regional Council elections is recorded in the AEC publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Electoral Newsfile</EMPHASIS>  No 39, February 1994, and is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1993&mdash;2001 nominations: Bourke&mdash;54; Coffs Harbour&mdash;73; Queanbeyan&mdash;67; Sydney&mdash;46; Tamworth&mdash;77; Wagga Wagga&mdash;80; Ballarat&mdash;70; Wangaratta&mdash;64; Brisbane&mdash;101; Cairns&mdash;89; Cooktown&mdash;39; Mt Isa&mdash;76; Rockhampton&mdash;68; Roma&mdash;77; Townsville&mdash;20; Broome&mdash;36; Derby&mdash;50; Geraldton&mdash;46; Kalgoorlie&mdash;32; Kununurra&mdash;50; Narrogin&mdash;55; Perth&mdash;83; South Hedland&mdash;47; Warburton&mdash;17; Adelaide&mdash;56; Ceduna&mdash;32; Port Augusta&mdash;63; Hobart&mdash;56; Alice Springs&mdash;37; Apatula&mdash;56; Darwin&mdash;33; Jabiru&mdash;59; Katherine&mdash;50; Nhulunbuy&mdash;33; Tennant Creek&mdash;60.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Details of the number of persons who voted and the percentage of eligible voters in each region in each of the elections of the 1993 round of Regional Council elections are also recorded in the AEC publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Electoral Newsfile</EMPHASIS>  No 39, February 1994. It should be noted that the statistics for eligible voters are estimates only, provided by ATSIC to the AEC and based on ABS census data, as there is no register of eligible voters (see response to question 7).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Voting is not compulsory for eligible voters at ATSIC elections. One reason for this is that there is no register of eligible voters for ATSIC elections. It is therefore impossible to identify non&hyphen;compliance. To be eligible to vote, a person must live in the ward concerned, be on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll, and be an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander. The Commonwealth Electoral Roll includes no provision to identify people by race. People wishing to vote have their eligibility verified at the polling booth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An independent review of ATSIC's electoral systems was conducted following the last round of Regional Council elections under the provisions of Division 9 of Part 3 of the ATSIC Act. The review involved widespread community consultation. One of the recommendations from that review was to establish a register of eligible voters for ATSIC elections. However, it was not feasible for such a register to be introduced for the 1996 elections. Nevertheless, the Review Panel recommended that voting in ATSIC elections should remain non&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2046">compulsory. If compulsory voting was imposed, then there would have to be a penalty for not voting and an intention to impose this. There would be considerable effort and costs involved in the follow up action necessary. It was considered that, rather than devoting additional resources to measures which force people to vote under the threat of a penalty for non&hyphen;compliance, more value could be obtained by better educating the community in relation to the power of their vote.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)&hyphen;(5) I announced the proposed transfer on 8 March 1996 and the Governor-General signed the Administrative Arrangements Order giving effect to it on 11 March 1996. The functions, staff and resources of the Office were transferred in toto for the remainder of 1995&hyphen;96. Funding arrangements in respect of future years are to be considered as part of the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget process. This in no sense represents a retreat from previous commitments. Indeed, the transfer has opened up new opportunities for furthering the multicultural agenda. New synergies will be created, better coordination of functions will result and there will be greater opportunities to share knowledge and expertise. There will be no duplication of work between my Department and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Multicultural affairs will benefit from the increased support available through the overall resources of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
