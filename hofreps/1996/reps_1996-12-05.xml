<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill establishes the core elements of a new telecommunications regulatory framework for the era beginning 1 July 1997. Together with related bills in this package&mdash;11 in total&mdash;it will introduce full and open competition, reinforce and reinvigorate consumer protection arrangements and bring about significant reforms to technical regulation. It will provide an environment in which Australian businesses and telecommunications users will get maximum value from a dynamic telecommunications industry. The regime will provide a framework within which the Australian telecommunications sector can develop into an industry based on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">world&hyphen;class infrastructure using the latest market driven technology mix;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">a multitude of service providers offering diverse and innovative carriage and content services; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">contestable market strategies which drive prices down and quality of service up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislative package fulfils in full the government's election commitment to bring about a new era of competition and to establish a world&hyphen;class consumer protection framework. Telecommunications services are an essential component of our lives both at home and at work. The role they play is becoming increasingly important as technological developments not only provide innovations in traditional telephony services but also allow us to reach out to the world via services such as the Internet and to access financial, education, health and similar services. We are beginning to see the benefits that telecommunications services present when used as a tool in these ways. The future can only be more exciting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Facilitating the development of a truly competitive market from a monopoly is an evolutionary process. The government must progressively remove regulatory barriers and constraints on genuine competitive conduct; it also must increasingly shift responsibility for regulation to the industry itself. Significant <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> efficiency gains can be achieved through greater reliance on self&hyphen;regulation in networked industries such as telecommunications because regulatory structures and arrangements can be better designed to reflect industry and community needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package of legislation provides the framework for the telecommunications industry to take responsibility for key areas of regulation over and above the legislative guarantees provided. In the areas of competition regulation, mechanisms are available for the industry to develop agreed approaches to access and preselection management for adoption by the regulator. Similarly, in addition to foundation consumer protections and technical standards, the industry will have all the tools necessary to develop codes of conduct in consumer related areas and voluntary technical standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The successful development of industry codes will be to the benefit of all players. It is therefore incumbent on all in the industry to fully and constructively participate in these self&hyphen;regulatory mechanisms. The industry itself must provide the necessary resources. Consumer representatives must, where appropriate, have the opportunity to contribute to issues. In this context, I welcome the preparatory work the industry has undertaken in recent times&mdash;including work associated with the formation of the Telecommunications Access Forum and an overarching industry forum known as the Communications Industry Forum&mdash;to establish self&hyphen;regulatory and consultative mechanisms in anticipation of its future responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Self&hyphen;regulation will evolve over time and should not be expected to be comprehensive from day one. It requires progressive review and strengthening of self&hyphen;regulatory mechanisms which, in turn, will require industry commitment on an ongoing basis. The government recognises, however, that in some areas industry consensus may not be achievable, and safeguard provisions exist to enable the regulator to step in and establish standards or arbitrate an outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the major provisions of this bill. There will be no regulatory barriers to entry into the telecommunications industry. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7800"> For regulatory purposes, the bill separately identifies persons who are responsible for regulatory obligations relating to telecommunications network infrastructure, carriers, and those persons who provide carriage or content services to the public by using this infrastructure, known as service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Carriers are very important to the regulatory scheme because they provide the basic transmission infrastructure on which the supply of carriage and content services to the public rely. Carriers will be individually licensed and subject to charges that recover the costs of regulating the industry. They will also share the net losses incurred in fulfilling the universal service obligation. Any artificial arrangements designed to thwart these policy intentions will be met by swift action by the government. The government will be maximising the opportunities for Australian industry through a licence condition that requires all carriers to have an industry development plan, unless exempted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill makes use of a new concept of service provider which includes both carriage service providers&mdash;who supply carriage services to the public&mdash;and content service providers, such as the providers of broadcasting and on&hyphen;line services. Carriers will be service providers when they provide carriage or content services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Service providers will be regulated by rules established in the legislation, replacing the existing class licence regime. The government does not intend that the bill be used to regulate the content of content services. Content service providers have been included so they can benefit from rights to access services under the proposed access regime. Content will continue to be regulated under legislation such as the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telecommunications services are today a fundamental part of social interaction, particularly for those in remote communities. They also provide a lifeline in emergency situations and are an essential component of business activities. While competition is itself a vital part of the government's strategy to encourage continuing improvements in service and price reductions, the government recognises that market forces may not always be sufficient to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> guarantee outcomes that are in the interests of all consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this bill re&hyphen;enacts many aspects of the consumer protection and community obligation arrangements in the existing Telecommunications Act, in doing so the government has taken the opportunity to fundamentally reinvigorate those existing arrangements. We have also incorporated additional new protections applicable for an open entry market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the core of the community obligations of the telecommunications industry is the universal service obligation, USO. The government is firmly committed to maintaining a general obligation on the industry to ensure that all people in Australia have reasonable access to the standard telephone service&mdash;including customer equipment&mdash;payphones, and prescribed additional carriage services on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business, and a supporting obligation to supply those services on request. The universal service provisions in this bill, while based on those in the Telecommunications Act 1991, incorporate changes to clarify and update the universal service obligation, improve efficiency and transparency, and align it with the open market post&hyphen;1997 regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Carriers will contribute to funding of losses incurred in fulfilling the USO in direct proportion to their share of total `eligible revenue', which is to be defined in regulations, but would include revenue from a broad range of carriage services. Alternative arrangements will enable carrier contributions to be set according to a methodology determined by the minister, with the agreement of carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign the government promised that the option of untimed local calls would be maintained and extended to business customers. This bill fulfils that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will also: provide a customer service guarantee covering all carriage service providers in relation to the connection of standard services, rectification of faults and keeping of appointments; extend the existing obligation to enter into the telecommunications industry ombudsman scheme, which I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7801"> commend to the House, from just carriers to all carriage service providers providing the standard telephone service to residential and small business customers, or a public mobile telecommunications service, and to other carriage service providers directed by the ACA to join the scheme; require carriage service providers who were not carriers on 30 June 1997 to comply with a scheme formulated by the ACA to offer protection to residential customers supplied with the standard telephone service against a failure to supply the service when the customer has made a protected payment; provide that end users of a standard telephone service have direct access, free of charge, to emergency services, in accordance with requirements imposed by the ACA on carriers, carriage service providers and emergency call persons, the objective here to provide, from the perspective of the end&hyphen;user, a single emergency service that meets the community's needs, while providing necessary flexibility to address changing arrangements and technologies; re&hyphen;enact obligations on telecommunications operators to cooperate with law enforcement agencies; and protect the confidentiality of communications and the personal particulars of customers from unlawful disclosure by persons in the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A codes of practice regime is established to provide a framework for industry self&hyphen;regulation by means of industry&hyphen;developed codes that are registered with the ACA. The codes regime will supplement and enhance the fundamental consumer protection arrangements established in this bill and to which I have already referred. Codes can address areas of concern to consumers that are currently unregulated. As a fail&hyphen;safe, this self&hyphen;regulation mechanism is backed up by the ability of the ACA to make mandatory standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better Communications</EMPHASIS> the coalition gave a commitment that from 1 July 1997 it would eliminate the current exemptions for telecommunications carriers from planning and environmental laws. The provisions in this bill fulfil that commitment. The provisions establish a general rule that, from 1 July 1997, state and territory planning and environ ment laws will generally apply to telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three exceptions to this general rule: first, some standing exemptions for installation of low impact facilities and temporary defence facilities, and for inspection of land and maintenance of facilities; second, a limited case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case appeals process; and, third, a continuation of some specific powers and immunities currently contained in the Telecommunications Act 1991, including to allow for all facilities legally installed under that regime to continue to be exempt from state and territory laws and to allow individual subscribers to be connected to networks existing as at 30 June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case appeals process would be to an independent panel. An appeal will be open to carriers only in limited circumstances: where negotiations with the relevant authorities or owners have broken down; where the facility is an important part of a network of national significance; where the construction of a substantial part of that network has been approved by relevant authorities or already installed; and where the advantages to the national economy from the operation of the network to which the facility belongs outweighs any associated degradation of environmental amenity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The panel will comprise the Chairman of the ACA and up to four specially appointed associate members. In appointing those members, the government will make sure that they are independent, have appropriate experience and the ability to consider all appeals in an impartial manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is very conscious of the public concern about possible degradation of environmental amenity due to installation of aerial cable and construction of mobile towers. The bill requires that carriers co&hyphen;locate mobile facilities on radiocommunications towers and radiocommunications sites&mdash;and facilities in ducts&mdash;unless it is not technically feasible to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally important, cabling of the broadband type will not be permitted to be located aerially, unless the relevant state or territory authority agrees. Connections of individual <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7802"> subscribers to these existing types of networks will be required to be underground, unless the subscriber agrees to aerial connection.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I think it is. The government's pre&hyphen;election commitment to subject the telecommunications industry to state and territory planning and environmental law from July 1997 is reinforced by our intention to have only limited transitional arrangements. These arrangements will apply to carrier activities which have been through notification processes and where construction has commenced before 30 June 1997. In relation to broadband aerial cabling, construction must be completed by 30 September 1997 and construction of other types of telecommunications infrastructure must be completed before 31 December 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's policy in relation to carrier powers and immunities from 1 July 1997 strikes the right balance between encouraging investment in infrastructure to meet the growing demand for new telecommunications services and facilitating further competition while also addressing the legitimate concerns of local communities about the effect of the roll&hyphen;out of telecommunications infrastructure in their local environment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the second of a series of 11 bills to give effect to the major proposed changes to the telecommunications industry. This bill is a critical component of that package of legislation introduced to establish a new regulatory framework that will provide for a more competitive telecommunications industry from 1 July 1997. This bill is titled the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7803"> The bill contains key competition related provisions that complement the broader regulatory arrangements, including in relation to consumer protection, contained in the Telecommunications Bill 1996, which I have just presented. It will bring the regulation of competition in the telecommunications industry more closely into line with general trade practices law and incorporate telecommunications industry specific rules on competition into the Trade Practices Act 1974. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commis sion, the ACCC, will be responsible for administering these rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The post&hyphen;1997 telecommunications legislative package will remove regulatory barriers to market entry as well as a number of artificial regulatory distinctions, such as those between mobile and fixed services. The reforms within this package will give all industry operators, both existing and new, the freedom to pursue the business strategy they choose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an open market, all carriers and service providers, including Telstra, must be given the flexibility to engage in normal competitive conduct&mdash;Australian consumers will not benefit from regulation that unnecessarily hampers the ability of operators to respond to the market. Therefore, the approach adopted in this bill is not as interventionist as the anti&hyphen;discrimination prohibitions in the Telecommunications Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, there remain good reasons for there to continue to be industry specific competition regulation for telecommunications. The removal of regulatory barriers to entry does not automatically result in the appearance of normal competitive market structures. Telstra continues to wield significant market power derived primarily from its historical monopoly position. There is also scope for incumbent operators generally to engage in anti&hyphen;competitive conduct because competitors in downstream markets depend on access to the carriage services controlled by them. The possibility, for example, of incumbents engaging in anti&hyphen;competitive cross&hyphen;subsidy practices could threaten the further development of a competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All members of the telecommunications industry will be fully subject to general trade practices law contained in part IV of the Trade Practices Act. The exemption from part IV given to carriers under the Telecommunications Act 1991 for the supply of basic carriage services will not be continued. Total reliance on part IV of the TPA to constrain anti&hyphen;competitive conduct might, in some cases, prove ineffective given the still developing state of competition in the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fast pace of change and complex nature of horizontal and vertical arrangements of firms operating in this industry mean that any anti&hyphen;competitive behaviour could cause rapid damage to the competition that has already developed and severely hamper new entry. Therefore, as well as part IV of the act applying fully to telecommunications, the amendments made by this bill will supplement part IV by increasing the ability of the ACCC to respond swiftly where anti&hyphen;competitive conduct is evident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important feature of the telecommunications industry is that competitors inevitably must make use of each other's networks. This is because many communications services&mdash;for example, telephone calls&mdash;require any&hyphen;to&hyphen;any connectivity: the ability for any end user of the service to contact any other end user, regardless of who the suppliers are or on what network they are connected. This any&hyphen;to&hyphen;any feature&mdash;and the government's commitment to promote the diversity of carriage and content services available to end users&mdash;requires an access regime that includes additional features to those contained in the general access regime in part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act. Furthermore, the government recognises that there are expectations of continuity regarding the broad rights contained in existing access arrangements in part 8 of the Telecommunications Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons, the government's philosophy in preparing the telecommunications access regime has been to follow an approach based on part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act as far as practicable&mdash;nevertheless, to introduce some additional refinements to ensure that the arrangements will work effectively for the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A smooth introduction of the new access regime depends critically on transitional arrangements. Transitional arrangements contained in the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996 will essentially retain existing access rights for carriers, extend those rights to service providers and fulfil the government's election commitment to achieve open access in regard to the carriage of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7804"> broadcasting services over cable networks. I will now turn to the key provisions of this bill in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Anti&hyphen;competitive conduct</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill inserts a new part XIB into the Trade Practices Act, establishing a number of additional powers for the ACCC to deal with anti&hyphen;competitive conduct in telecommunications markets and to collect information to assist it in monitoring competition in the telecommunications industry. This part establishes a competition rule that a carrier or carriage service provider must not engage in anti&hyphen;competitive conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACCC will be able to bring proceedings before the Federal Court at any time for an injunction to stop anti&hyphen;competitive conduct, but it will also be able to issue a competition notice stating that a carrier or carriage service provider has engaged in anti&hyphen;competitive conduct. While a competition notice remains in force:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the ACCC will be able to bring proceedings before the Federal Court for substantial pecuniary penalties in relation to further conduct of the kind detailed in the notice; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> other persons will be able to seek an injunction to restrain or otherwise deal with further conduct of the kind detailed in the notice or, if they suffer loss or damage as a result of any further conduct, to take action to recover the amount of the loss or damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A competition notice will also be prima facie evidence of the matters in the notice for the purpose of any proceeding taken in relation to the notice. As the new legislative arrangements will introduce some level of uncertainty until regulators and the industry develop a clear understanding of its operations, the ACCC will be required to formulate guidelines before 1 July 1997 for use in deciding whether to issue a competition notice.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Access</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The telecommunications access regime in part XIC provides foundation access rights to all industry operators and establishes a framework within which the industry can develop <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> additional arrangements to improve the efficiency with which access is supplied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The access regime provides for regulated access rights to be established for specific carriage services and related services, and provides a framework within which the terms and conditions of access can be determined. It will reduce the power of those owning or controlling important infrastructure or services which are necessary for competitive services to be supplied to end users. In doing so, judgments by new and existing operators about whether to build their own networks or buy capacity on existing networks will be driven by normal commercial factors. Decisions to build will only be taken where commercial considerations clearly favour this strategy. The regime will therefore promote the efficient use of, and investment in, infrastructure.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is well done. It is a fundamental issue. I am glad that members have appreciated that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a clear policy intention that, as much as possible, both the determination of access rights and terms and conditions of access be the result of commercial processes and industry self&hyphen;regulation. The bill provides for the establishment of a Telecommunications Access Forum, TAF&mdash;a body open to all carriers and carriage service providers&mdash;to manage those matters. The government expects the industry as a whole to work constructively to develop industry&hyphen;driven solutions to access issues which reflect the legitimate interests of those seeking access and those under access obligations and which operate in the long&hyphen;term interests of end users of telecommunications services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wants the benefits of increased competition to flow as soon as possible. It wants all service providers to be placed in the position of having foundation access rights equal to those currently enjoyed by the carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Transitional arrangements included in the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996 will provide that services supplied between <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7805"> the existing carriers will, unless they would not promote the objects of the access regime, be declared services under this new access regime. In addition, the ACCC is required to declare a carriage service to bring within this access regime the supply of broadcasting services over cable networks. This fulfils our election commitment to remove the exemption of pay television carriage from the access regime given by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the provisions in part XIB and part XIC will assist in creating more vigorous competition at all levels of the telecommunications market with benefits to the Australian community through lower prices and better quality. The new industry&hyphen;specific competition provisions contained in this bill will serve to reduce damage that can be inflicted by those wielding general or localised market power. They will also open up opportunities for industry participants to offer new and innovative services to consumers.</PARA>

The bill will, however, involve the transfer of competition and access regulatory functions for telecommunications from Austel to the ACCC and significant work to ensure transitional arrangements operate effectively. Accordingly, further resources will be required for the ACCC, estimated to be in the order of $1 million in the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year. Additional expenditure will be offset by carrier licence application charges and annual fees imposed by the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Termination Bill 1996 and the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Bill 1996. The details of the ongoing resource requirements for the ACCC will be considered in the 1997&hyphen;98 and subsequent budget processes. I commend the bill to the House.

<PARA>This bill is part of a package of bills, including the Telecommunications Bill 1996 and the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill 1996, which I have just introduced, that comprise the post&hyphen;1997 telecommunications legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7806"> The ACA will be formed by merging Austel, without its competition regulation function, with the Spectrum Management Agency, an existing agency.

The ACA's major functions will be the regulation of telecommunications in accordance with the proposed Telecommunications Act 1996 and the regulation of radiocommunications in accordance with the Radiocommunications Act 1992. This will see the ACA being responsible for many consumer matters, technical regulation and the management of the radiofrequency spectrum. An important consideration for the ACA will be the government's underlying preference for industry self&hyphen;regulation and the ACA's pro posed role in assisting industry to establish self&hyphen;regulatory arrangements and providing a safety net if self&hyphen;regulation fails.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Radiocommunications Amendment Bill 1996 is the last in a series of 11 bills that give effect to the government's proposed changes to the telecommunications industry, to take effect in July 1997. The Radiocommunications Amendment Bill 1996 seeks to amend the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to facilitate increased competition in telecommunications, and deals with a number of other matters to improve mechanisms for the management of the radiofrequency spectrum. The amendments proposed in the bill complement amendments proposed in related telecommunications legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, the amendments provide for: sale of spectrum while encumbered and later clearance of incumbent users; application of section 50 and other related sections of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to the allocation and issuing of radiocommunications licences; a ministerial power to limit the amount of spectrum persons can acquire at price based allocations; extending the period of spectrum licences to a maximum of fifteen years; implementation of electromagnetic compatibility requirements; the setting of radiocommunications standards for health and safety purposes; and the removal of provisions for technical licence specifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7810"> I now turn to the details of the bill. Selling spectrum while encumbered will allow early allocation to the new owner, who can undertake planning while the rights of the incumbents are protected. Under the proposed system of reallocation declarations, incum bents receive at least two years notice of the need to vacate spectrum. The actual period will depend on the circumstances, including the extent of any previous forewarning of incumbents by planning processes and the urgency of the need for the spectrum for new uses. Incumbents will also have the opportunity to buy at auction the spectrum they are operating in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under current arrangements, spectrum licences may be issued for fixed terms up to 10 years. This term is proposed to be extended to a maximum of 15 years to provide greater certainty and opportunity for return on investment. A 10&hyphen;year spectrum licence term was not considered by industry to be long enough to offer an attractive investment. A licence term of up to 15 years should enhance potential participants' confidence to commit to substantial financial investment in communications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Trade Practices Act 1974, TPA, currently applies to radiocommunications licences after they are issued but not to the initial allocation and licence issue. The proposed amendment would apply section 50 of the TPA to the licence issue process and to the use of spectrum under an authorisation given by a licensee to third parties. This closes gaps in regulatory coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment proposing the creation of a ministerial power to set limits which would apply during a licence allocation process supplements the competition protection functions under the TPA. This would allow the minister to consider and, if necessary, set pro&hyphen;competitive limits to provide some opportunity for new entrants to purchase spectrum licences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments would support the Spectrum Management Agency's EMC standards making power with respect to a range of devices including computers, navigation equipment, industrial equipment such as arc welding equipment and power tools, and spark ignition engines. Many of these devices have long histories of either causing interference to other devices or being susceptible to interference from other devices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed extension of the SMA's standards making powers to include protection <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the health and safety of persons who operate, work on or use radiocommunications transmitters or receivers, or are reasonably likely to be affected by their operation, enables the SMA to enforce compliance of radiocommunications devices, receivers and transmitters with such standards. It also harmonises radiocommunications legislation with telecommunications legislation. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill, together with a detailed explanation of the principles of the bill. In so doing, this concludes this major package. I take the opportunity on behalf of the government to thank particularly many colleagues who have been involved in the delivery of information and assistance with the preparation of the package and also particularly the Department of Communications and the Arts which put in many hours to put together this major piece of legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget Measures) Bill before the House this morning proposes a number of changes to veterans' and war widows' entitlements. Some of those changes are unambiguously good, some are fair, but regrettably some are decidedly unfair. The financial impact of this bill may be minor when viewed in the context of the budget as a whole, but the effect on a number of veterans will be great.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I foreshadow that the opposition will be moving some amendments in the consideration in detail stage of this bill. I will comment on some of those amendments that we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7811"> propose as I go through my speech on the second reading. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The veterans' affairs 1996 package honours key pre&hyphen;election promises to the veterans' community.</PARA>
<PARA>When the minister says key promises&mdash;and we know about core and non&hyphen;core promises&mdash;what he actually means is that the government has honoured some promises but certainly not all promises. The coalition promised before the election that they would `maintain all existing veterans' entitlements'. Whilst veterans' specific entitlements have been largely untouched, it is in the area of mainstream aged care services where the veteran community has come in for a hammering. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is in the chamber today and we went through some of this exercise yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's structural reform of aged care will net savings in the vicinity of half a billion dollars. A further $88 million will be saved through additional user charges in home and community care. Veterans make up around one&hyphen;quarter of the male population aged over 65 years and veterans and war widows together make up around 15 per cent of the total population aged over 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, the veterans community will substantially contribute to the cost cutting measures of the government through a reduction in their entitlements. This is, without qualification, a broken promise. It is worth while to touch briefly on a few of these measures because it is the first opportunity we have had to debate them. It may also be the last opportunity this year to bring the government to account over its broken promise to the veterans community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I start by briefly referring to the nursing home entry contribution farce. The government's decision to align the nursing home system with a hostel system will result in many veterans and war widows having to pay an entry contribution to gain admittance to a nursing home. The average commitment will be in the vicinity of $26,000.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the minister is sensitive about that, just look at what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had to say yesterday in response to this in the House. The issue was being debated here regrettably in question time and subsequently in the MPI. Concern was raised about entry to nursing homes and whether people would have to sell their homes or rent them out. The Prime Minister's response, in a typical uncaring fashion, was, `So what.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7812"> The government has said that their decision to impose an entry fee on new nursing home residents was simply a matter of aligning the two systems of nursing homes and hostel care. As I tried to point out yesterday, this is not a defensible position. The two types of care are radically different. Hostel care can, in many cases, be seen as a lifestyle choice, and that level of care is also available in the homes through community aged care packages. Nursing home care, on the other hand, represents a far more serious decision on the part of the resident. It is a hospital level of care reserved for those who are extremely frail or suffering from dementia. If a potential resident is deemed by an aged care assess ment team to require a place in a nursing home, it is considered a last resort. In other words, it is the only appropriate care mechanism available to that person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why it is different, and that is what we said yesterday, but the Minister for Family Services said that this was rubbish. Indeed, even the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) said it was rubbish. It clearly demonstrates that on the Gold Coast she has no understanding of the nursing home requirements of aged people, and that of course includes veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The income testing recurrent subsidies issue is one which is also of great concern. Many veterans and war widows reside in hostels and nursing homes, and they will be subject to an additional charge of 25c in the dollar over the pension&hyphen;free area. For a single veteran, any money earned over $98 a fortnight will be reduced by a quarter, up to a maximum of $238 a week. Current residents did not plan for this when they entered residential care, and their financial plans in many cases will be ruined. It is an inequitable measure that targets frail aged veterans and war widows.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is really not a bad bloke, but he should think carefully before he speaks. Increases in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme concessional patient contributions is another area which is of concern to veterans. Although a 50c increase in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> patient contribution of pharmaceutical costs does not seem very large, it is affecting a group of people on relatively small fixed incomes. Again, they were not warned of this added impost and many will find it difficult to adjust to the new expense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there is the increased user charges on home and community care. It is difficult to know where or how this new charge is likely to fall, as it will depend on the states and the providers. Veterans are already significantly disadvantaged when it comes to HACC services. The states have admitted that many providers discriminate against veterans because they assume that their care is the sole responsibility of the states. This measure will have a compounding effect on veterans' ability to access HACC services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say again to my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who I am pleased is in the chamber for this debate, that each of those issues that I have just raised are outside his portfolio responsibilities. I have been on record at RSL congresses and I have been on record in this place on a couple of occasions saying that the minister really did not have that control over the cross-portfolio effects that were going to be felt on the veterans community. I say it again in this speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister actually achieved a reasonable outcome for the veterans community in his own area in not having his government slash and burn the entitlements to veterans. But when you come to the cross-portfolio areas, as I have said to the minister and I have said publicly, it is in those areas where the Minister for Family Services, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) have had their wicked way with you. They have slashed into the effect that will be felt by veterans and war widows more broadly because of the policies in aged care that your government continues to pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the House can see, veterans and war widows have not escaped lightly from the budget cuts. For the government to suggest that they have honoured their commitment to the veterans community is pure hyperbole. The minister has, and I accept that, but it is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7813"> his ministerial colleagues who are putting the spear right into the veterans community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the specific measures in the bill. Firstly, I mention the amendments related to allocated pensions. This measure amends the service pension asset test treatment of allocated pensions. The current asset value of allocated pension investments will be taken into account for the purposes of the assets test, regardless of the person's age, effectively closing a loophole, and aligns the Department of Veterans' Affairs with the Department of Social Security, which instituted similar measures in July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might indicate to the government that the opposition actually agrees it is unfair that some people could gain increased income support by entering into particular investment arrangements. Therefore, of course, we will not be opposing this particular measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments relating to earnings credits, however, need further consideration. The earnings credit scheme allows pensioners and allowees to take up temporary or casual work without affecting their level of payment. Pensioners can accrue an earnings credit of up to $1,050, or $2,100 for couples combined, to offset earnings on employment before payments are affected. This bill seeks to abolish this arrangement. The earnings credit scheme gave pensioners and allowees an incentive to take any casual or temporary work that became available by giving them an incentive to supplement their payments without immediately or necessarily reducing their level of payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that this is a regressive step, particularly when the government purports to encourage people back into employment and towards increased financial independence. People will be deterred from taking up this kind of employment, and the opposition remains opposed to this reduction in veterans' entitlements as it represents yet another broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that there will be those on the government side who will come into this debate and suggest that, because very few people have taken advantage of this provision, there is no point in keeping it. We would argue that, if there are so few people who <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have taken advantage of this provision, why eliminate it? When you look at the savings provisions that have been listed, you will see there aren't any. There are no savings provisions listed for this because it is so low. Therefore, why have the change? If the government is committed to the whole issue associated with trying to make people a little more financially independent, giving the elderly in our community who perhaps are in receipt of some benefit&mdash;in this case, a veterans' entitlement&mdash;the opportunity to earn some funds elsewhere, why take away that right where it might impact on them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the amendments relating to funeral benefits, this particular measure provides for the payment of a funeral benefit for the transport of the body of a veteran who dies away from home in indigent circumstances. This is in keeping with the overall respectful and supportive treatment of veterans and this, of course, is a feature of the repatriation system. Again, although at a cost of $32,000 over four years to the government, this is a measure with which the opposition concurs fully and one we would not be opposing in any way whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments similarly relating to the Victoria Cross allowance are not to be opposed by the opposition. These will increase the value of the Victoria Cross allowance paid to Australian recipients to $2,700 and bring it into line with the same allowance paid to British recipients. It follows the former government's granting of a special gold travel card to Australia's three surviving VC recipients: Ted Kenna, Keith Payne and Sir Roden Cutler. As I said, I commend the minister for bringing forward this particular matter where it does align it with other allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments relating to lump sum compensation payments, however, are probably worth further consideration. The devisor which is used to calculate preclusion periods is to be changed from the all persons average weekly earnings to the amount above which no pension is payable to a single person under the income test, which is currently $397 per week. Pensioners and allowees affected by this measure will be subject to longer periods without payments, forcing them to use up <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7814"> their compensation at a lower rate before being eligible for financial assistance or continued assistance. We will be opposing this measure. It is only to save $98,000 over four years, according to the government's documentation. We believe that, for such a paltry amount, the angst that will be caused by changing the devisor is not realistic. As I have indicated, we will be moving an amendment at the appropriate stage to try to have the government change its mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preclusion period will be applied to compensation recipients only, and not to their partner. That is, for lump sums received on or after 20 March 1997, recovery of past payments to partners will not be made, nor will partners be precluded from receiving any future entitlement they may have during their partner's preclusion period. That saving of $100,000 over four years is not something which the opposition would dispute and, accordingly, we would be agreeing with that particular change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments relating to extended deeming, however, will be opposed because, once again, this represents a broken promise as was delivered to the veterans community by the government during the last election campaign. These particular amendments apply a deeming rate of five per cent on all bank deposits held by pensioners and the unemployed. The first $2,000 for singles, $4,000 for couples, used to be exempt as the `below threshold rate'. This measure relies on pensioners and allowees being able to access accounts which pay interest at the deemed rate. Under half of all financial institutions make these available; not all are available to pensioners and allowees. This represents, in effect, something close to $100 a year to be taken off pensioners. You have to say that that is pretty miserly; it is pretty miserable. But, regrettably, it is in keeping with some of the things that this government is doing in the area of aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I just say to the Minister for Veterans Affairs&mdash;because I have seen him in action, and I know he has a genuine commitment to the veterans community&mdash;this is really something on which you should go back to the Treasurer and the Minister for Family Ser vices and have another discussion about. It just seems to us on this side of the parliament that, whilst the savings are estimated at something like $7.8 million&mdash;and that is a considerable amount of money in anyone's terms&mdash;when you look at it in terms of what it will mean to the pensioner who will be affected here of $100 a year being taken from them, it is pretty miserly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I just appeal to the minister to take into consideration and on board some of the views that will be expressed in this debate, particularly by those on this side of the House, in his summing up of this legislation. I just indicate again that we will be moving some amendments in respect of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, as I said&mdash;and I come back to where I started&mdash;many of these changes that are being proposed for veterans' and war widows' entitlements are unambiguously good. Some of them are very fair and we do not dispute that. In fact, some of the proposals in here are simply extensions of what we in government were giving consideration to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are one or two proposals that are unfair and I think they go to the core issue of looking after those people who are in need in the broad community. They plan their lives. I am sure that all of us who represent elderly people in this parliament recognise that they plan very carefully how they are going to spend their fixed incomes that come in the way of veterans' pensions or some other social security benefit. They would see this change being brought in as a broken promise, at a time when no indication was given to them that this was going to happen.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite Australia's remoteness, wars have dominated Australian life in the 20th century. The powerful image of Australians at war, particularly the Anzacs, have had a major impact on the history of this nation. It is frightening to think that, collectively, a whole decade of the first part of this century was dominated by the two world wars. A major war literally means the wholesale decimation of a generation of young Australian men and women whose brains, ability and creativeness will never be fully appreciated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Soldiers on all sides know war is a brutal existence, filled with waste and horror. But the hidden cost to a nation is extraordinary. It must be remembered that each serviceman <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> left behind not only a family, a mother or a wife or both and in many cases children but also their careers and future dreams. A young corporal from New South Wales summed up the horrendous nature of the First World War when he wrote in his diary:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of us enlisted for Patriotism or Love of Adventure but not one . . . had the slightest conception of the terrible price required . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is hard to believe that half of the eligible men in Australia enlisted in the First World War. Of all those who sailed away to fight, 65 per cent were either killed or wounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government recognises Australia's debt of gratitude to our veterans community, which served us so unselfishly in times of conflict. To reflect their invaluable and selfless contribution to our society, the coalition is firmly committed to their wellbeing and care. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill helps us to achieve this goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently the Department of Veterans' Affairs is responsible for the care of over 300,000 veterans and their dependants. The coalition has guaranteed to maintain all existing veterans' entitlements. This bill introduces the first instalment of the government's veterans' affairs budget commitments. The majority of the measures contained in the bill correct anomalies in the veterans' entitlements. The review of anomalies was a key undertaking in the coalition's policy statements on veterans' issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other measures in the bill will help improve administration of the veterans' programs and enhance service delivery. The government has honoured key pre&hyphen;election promises to the veterans community in the 1996 budget. It provides simpler and more flexible entitlements. It is fair, with better access to services and more assistance to help veterans help themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commemoration, health care, housing, rehabilitation and compensation are the major initiatives covered by this bill. In particular, a number of anomalies will be removed from the system, resulting in more efficient administration and simplified service delivery.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7816">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to commemoration, I am very pleased that the Victoria Cross allowance will be increased. This rate now being paid to the three surviving recipients will be backdated to August 1995, which is the date the British government increased their Victoria Cross allowance. This financial acknowledgment of the valour of our veterans will be in line with other governments around the world, but it is only a token of the veterans' true worth. This initiative increases the allowance paid to Australian recipients of the Victoria Cross and will cost $45,000, including the backdated payments, over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also implemented a number of beneficial health care initiatives that do not require legislative action. Funding has been made available to provide Australian merchant mariners with access to asbestos screening programs. This is designed to assist in the detection of illnesses related to asbestos exposure. Previously our World War II Australian mariners had not been eligible for asbestos exposure screening programs which have been available to current and past members of the armed services and civilian employees. This initiative has given eligible veterans equal access to this very important service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also reviewing a list of eligible drugs contained in the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This review will ensure the best outcomes are achieved from the pharmaceutical treatment provided to veterans and war widows. A major review of the medication program for high risk veterans is also taking place. The aim of the review is to reduce inappropriate prescription and medication use and to improve the quality of life and health options of our veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes announced in the budget will remove anomalies by extending and improving the range of spectacle frames available through the DVA optometrical scheme. The changes will also allow veterans and war widows and widowers to obtain progressive power lenses, or multifocals, if they prefer, instead of bifocal or trifocal lenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Veterans' Affairs is a major purchaser of optometrical products, currently spending about $8.4 million per year <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on supplies and a further $3.1 million on consultations. The DVA is continuing to negotiate with the optometrical industry for improvement in quality and a better range of frames and lenses, as well as suitable pricing. These changes are due to be implemented by 1 February next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Veterans with special footwear requirements will find it more convenient to obtain new shoes or repair their old shoes. Footwear changes will particularly benefit veterans living in remote areas. They will now be able to be issued with up to three pairs of medical grade footwear at one time. Eligible veterans will also be able to use any footwear repairer contracted by the DVA for repairs to medical grade footwear. This means veterans will have greater access to repair services in locations convenient to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill makes several positive reforms that correct a number of anomalies in the Defence Services Home Act 1918. The first of these reforms is the reduction of the interest rate for new additional advances. Additional advances are available to people who have taken less than the maximum $25,000 loan that is available under the DSH scheme. The maximum amount of additional advance is the remaining balance of the $25,000. A person can have more than one additional advance within this limit. At present, a person who takes out the maximum loan available of $25,000 at an interest rate of 6.85 per cent per annum is disadvantaged if they later seek the balance by way of an additional advance because such advances are available at 10 per cent only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments mean that people will be able to use these advances for purposes such as home repairs or modifications without having to pay what is effectively a three per cent penalty interest rate. The rate of interest for additional advances under the defence service homes scheme will be reduced from 10 per cent to 6.85 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reform to the Defence Services Home Act 1918 is the extension of eligibility for assistance to widowers of World War II servicewomen. These veterans are themselves eligible persons and have previously been provided with assistance. At present, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7817"> widowers of eligible World War II servicewomen are comparatively disadvantaged if they have already been assisted on the basis of their own service. These veterans are currently not entitled to a second loan based on their status as widowers. On the other hand, World War II widows who are also ex&hyphen;servicewomen can receive this assistance. This anomaly will be removed and these men will now be entitled to a second loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third major reform of the Defence Services Homes Act 1918 is the extension of eligibility for loan assistance to persons who first enlisted in the Defence Force on or before 14 May 1985 and who served in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia or Somalia within certain periods of time. To date, this group of veterans has been denied assistance, even though their colleagues who enlisted later and served in the same areas have been able to obtain loans under the defence service homes scheme. The amendments mean that veterans will be able to receive defence service homes assistance on the basis of their service in those operational areas, even if they have not completed six years of peacetime service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With Australia's younger veterans in mind, the 1996 budget features a major initiative in the vital area of employment and training to provide ongoing care and assistance to Australia's younger veteran community. The veterans' employment and training scheme ensures that there are programs in place to help veterans who have difficulty in moving to, obtaining or holding civilian employment. The government has committed $2.3 million to this scheme in recognition of the special needs of our younger veterans. This new program will provide veterans with skills for their future and equip them to be competitive in the current employment market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vets' program will offer a range of services including vocational career guidance and counselling; practical assistance and guidance in securing employment; and training to supplement existing skills and education through short courses, TAFE and university enrolments at the undergraduate level.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This vocational rehabilitation program will contain a safety net which protects veterans' entitlements. The safety net will allow a veteran to undergo vocational rehabilitation without the loss of pensions, benefits and allowances that they may receive. When a veteran does find employment, some safety net items will be phased out over a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7818"> number of years while other items will be retained in their entirety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other changes that will simplify the administration of veterans' benefits are that there will be no need for pensioners to advise the department about small changes in their level of income. This will eliminate unnecessary administration and will also reduce the level of intrusion into veterans' lives. Modification will be made to the pension advance scheme, which will also improve administration efficiencies. Applicants will now be able to receive one advance per year but will no longer be required to provide information about how the advance is to be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes have also been made to correct an anomaly in the advance payments scheme. War widows and widowers who receive service pensions or income support supplement at the frozen or ceiling rate will now be able to obtain the $500 maximum allowable on pension advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government recognises the crucial role that veterans' advocates play in the repatriation claims scheme. Funding will be provided to ex-service organisations so they can employ more staff. This is in addition to the training programs already provided to ex-service organisations on veterans' entitlements and services. By helping to handle the applications for review of pension claims to the Veterans' Review Board, these advocates will improve the efficiency of the repatriation claims process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the turn of the century, about 60 per cent of Australia's veteran community will be over 75 years of age and will require different health, compensation and welfare services. Therefore, as a government, we must meet the changing needs of veterans, war widows and widowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Preparing for these changes is a major challenge for the government and the veteran community. The government is looking at how the demography of the veterans community will change over the next five to 10 years. We will be looking to the ex-service community to play an active role in developing an innovative approach to service delivery in the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill has a number of initiatives for the benefit of veterans including the streamlining of age pension payments to veterans receiving the disability pension; the automatic payment of pensions to widows and widowers the death of whose spouse was due to a previously accepted disability; improved entitlements for footwear and spectacles; and an innovative training program to assist veterans to gain and retain civilian employment when they leave the defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These initiatives demonstrate the strong and unequivocal commitment that this government has to veterans and their families. These Australians sacrificed so much for their country and contributed enormously to the freedom and way of life we all enjoy today. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Jagajaga)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.03 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposals in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill, which give effect to the measures announced in the budget, are, in our view, variable in their impact on veterans. Some are beneficial and we support them. Others are detrimental and we will certainly oppose them and propose the removal of particular parts of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will speak briefly about some of the things that we support in this bill, because they are positive changes. The first of these relates to the proposal to take account of the current asset value of allocated pension investments for the purpose of the assets test regardless of a person's age. This measure will make the assets test for veterans consistent with the test that has applied to other Department of Social Security pensioners since July 1992. It will, however, apply only to allocated pension investments made since the budget&mdash;an important matter for veterans to be aware of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also obviously very pleased to support the budget decision to increase the Victoria Cross allowance from $250 to $2,700 and to extend the funeral benefits payable to veterans' families. These will now include the costs associated with the transport of the remains of a veteran who has died in financial <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7819"> need away from home when obtaining medical treatment. Each of these measures can make a significant difference to the small number of veterans affected and their families. I am particularly pleased to support such a measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition also supports the decision to limit variations in pension and income support payments where these fall below $1 per fortnight. Current arrangements are both administratively cumbersome and unnecessarily intrusive for veterans. We are very pleased that they are being modified in the manner outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also support the removal of anomalies in the advance payments scheme to war widows and widowers. As a result, eligible people will be able to receive their full lump sum advance&mdash;I gather about $500&mdash;in one payment and will not be required to declare how they intend to use it. To date, there have been very few cases in which these people have indicated an intention to spend the advance on anything other than the purposes intended. There is thus little justification for continuing the current requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes changes to the Defence Service Homes Act. These will extend eligibility for assistance under the act and reduce interest rates on new additional advances taken out to cover house repairs and modifications. As I have in my constituency a very large number of people in this category, I am very pleased to support these changes as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition supports all of the changes referred to above. They involve a very small additional expenditure for government; nevertheless, they provide significant additional benefits for the individuals affected. Although the number of  veterans potentially affected by these measures is relatively small, it is not insignificant. We have a very large number of veterans and spouses and widows of veterans in my electorate of Jagajaga. I want to put on the record the significant debt that all of us owe to the veterans and their families. I very much support the measures, the continued assistance and additional assistance provided in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Other amendments included in this bill are much more problematic. They penalise veter ans rather than support them, and in a number of cases they break election promises that have been made to veterans about their entitlements and benefits. What was said before the election was that their entitlements and benefits would not be reduced. On these grounds, we oppose these measures, and I will go through some of these.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most objectionable measures in this bill is to discontinue the earnings credits scheme under which service pensioners and recipients of income support supplements can earn about $1,000, or $2,000 in the case of couples, without any impact on the level of earned income considered under the income test for determining their level of pensions and benefits. With the abolition of the scheme, which will take effect in March next year, there will be less incentive for veterans and their spouses to earn additional income to supplement their pension. This is a very short&hyphen;sighted and regressive measure, and we will certainly be opposing it. It will act as a disincentive to people who are going to be seeking and have sought casual or temporary work. I think it will lead to an increased reluctance by some to declare their income that they may earn in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another measure in this bill that we are very concerned about which the shadow minister has referred to is the measure that affects the treatment of lump sum compensation payments. These changes will not just be restricted to veterans. Under current arrangements, people receiving compensation payments, which include a component for loss of income, are not eligible for a government pension and benefits for a period calculated by the Department of Social Security according to a formula based on average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course this government is going to make life much harder for people who have any money of their own. Basically, under all of the government's proposals in this budget, you will be required to use every last cent before you become eligible for pensions or benefits. Unfortunately, that will apply to veterans and their families as well. The practical effect of this measure will be to require veterans to live for a longer period on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7820"> their compensation payments before they become eligible for financial assistance. It is a very mean measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also oppose the extension of the five per cent deeming rate to all bank deposits held by veterans. At present, those who hold bank accounts worth $2,000, or $4,000 for couples, are actually assessed for tax purposes at the actual rate payable by the bank. In every instance that I can find, that is at less than five per cent. This is a very punitive measure. We will actually see veterans paying the government for having such small bank accounts. I certainly have not been able to find any evidence where banks will be paying these interest rates, and we have no indication from the government that they will be changing the deeming rate to meet this reality. I understand that the Department of Veterans' Affairs actually estimates that more than 120,000 veterans will be affected by this measure. There is no question that veterans deserve a lot better than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to view all of the changes in this bill in the context of what else is happening to veterans. Veterans are not protected in any way from all the other very significant changes that affect older people in our community. Veterans, like other pensioners, will have to pay an extra 50c for every pharmaceutical script that they need and, of course, there is no compensating increase in the pension. What about what is going to happen to nursing home fees? We all know what is going to happen there.</PARA>

As others in this House <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the context of this debate have made clear, there are a number of other serious changes that will have a major impact on their circumstances. I have made considerable comment about the nursing home changes over the last few days, so I will forbear from adding to them because I think we have made it very clear that veterans, like other older people in our community, will have to pay, on average, $26,000 to get into a nursing home. They will also have to pay the additional fees for home and community care, which many of them are dependent on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other area that I want to touch on, which is very serious for veterans, and I think very important for me to say, particularly with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in the chamber, is that veterans are being seriously affected by the changes to funding for health services in both the state and federal arena. I happen to have a repatriation hospital in my own electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the minister has recently written to my colleague the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), in answer to some concerns from veterans in my electorate about what is happening at the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre. He stated in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As such, my department has an arrangement with the ARMC to reduce veteran waiting times in casualty.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister would be aware that there are some serious problems. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the hospital administrators are made aware of a veteran waiting in casualty for an extended period of time, the patient is redirected to a private contracted hospital rather than remaining unadmitted in a casualty ward.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>It is important for me to say directly to the minister while he is here that that is in fact not happening. I had a letter from a veteran constituent of mine who was left for 15 hours <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7821"> on a trolley in casualty recently. He was then transferred to another public hospital where he was finally admitted some hours later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, Minister, things are not happening in the way that you have described in your letter. You may not have been given the correct information, but I think it is important to raise in this place the fact that there are some serious problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue that the minister refers to in his letter are concerns about, as he said, the outbreak of golden staph at the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre. He has been informed, as he says in this letter to my colleague, that the outbreak was contained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a series of major concerns revealed through the media about infection at this medical centre, including the Repatriation hospital. Basically, what is being said by senior infection control specialists in Victoria is that the problems of infection control at the Repatriation and the Austin hospitals are the result of serious budget cutbacks. That is being said not by me or other politicians, but by senior infection control specialists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This infection control matter is serious. I am not saying that the minister knows about this matter and has not done anything about it; I am drawing his attention to the matter because it is serious. I would like to put this matter on the public record and ask him to address it as a very serious matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Patrick Ball, one of my veteran constituents&mdash;I am sure he will not mind if I name him&mdash;has described the situation at the Repatriation hospital in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is presently happening and is ongoing to this great hospital is an unmitigated disgrace and a national tragedy. The closure of wards and beds, reduction of staffs and services, constraints and restrictions imposed on doctors and nursing staff causing unnecessary stress, tension and frustration adding to an already excessive overwork.</PARA>
<PARA>These are very serious matters that are affecting veterans in Victoria. They are pertinent to a debate on veterans. I want to take this opportunity to raise them here today&mdash;and I know that the minister is concerned about veterans&mdash;because it is very important that he take a strong stand when it comes to dealing with the Victorian government which, I am <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> afraid to say, has only seen the Repatriation hospital, along with the Austin, as yet another place to find budget savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the minister to urgently address the serious problems that exist at these hospitals which have traditionally had the most outstanding reputation for care of veterans in our community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with pleasure that I speak on this veterans' affairs bill this morning. The honourable member for Maranoa, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), has talked <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7822"> extensively about Australia's debt of gratitude to our ex-servicemen and women.

Con Sciacca, for the work he put into making the Australia Remembers campaign the success that it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Townsville's celebration attracted thousands of veterans, visitors, official guests and media from around the world. It was recognised as a centrepiece of the nationwide Australia Remembers campaign. I repeat what I said in my first speech to this House, and it seems ages ago now: as a member of the Townsville City Council, I both watched and participated in the Townsville and Thuringowa Australia Remembers campaign, as the entire community, both young and old, worked hand in hand with business and government to ensure that the Townsville VP50 celebrations were the tremendous success that they proved to be.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Earlier this year when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) spent some time in my electorate, he paid an impromptu visit to the Towns ville RSL, shouting the bar and, in fact, winning a couple of meat trays which he promptly donated back to the RSL. He was with the minister, too. The Prime Minister has a high level of respect for Australia's veteran community, as I would think all members and senators do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During times of conflict Australian men and women went to war to defend their country, their families, their friends and their freedom. During World War II, Townsville was briefly shelled on three occasions by Japanese planes. Almost overnight Townsville was transformed from a small regional township into an enormous military centre for both Australian and American service personnel. The bunkers and gun placements on Castle Hill stand as a permanent reminder to that period of our history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noted with interest that veterans' affairs has been one of those areas of recent times where both the government and opposition of the day have been, in many respects, closely aligned with one another. Australians will always have a debt of gratitude to pay to our veteran community and this bill goes a long way in respecting that debt&mdash;as did the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 and as will the government's health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I do not consider Townsville to be either a remote or a rural centre, you do not have to go far outside of the Townsville and Thuringowa region to get the impression that you are isolated from services and service centres. If you look at the distribution of veterans, war widows and widowers in Queensland, a large number of people are located in rural and remote areas throughout central and northern Queensland. Some 22,488 Queensland veterans, war widows and widowers are located in rural areas, either large or small. A further 1,617 are identified as being located in remote Queensland areas. These are considerable figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hard enough getting around some places in rural and regional Queensland as it is. Inevitably, as we grow older the unavoidable stresses and strains that come with time also start to impact on our lives and our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7823"> ability to travel freely. I am sure the members for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and Kennedy (Mr Katter) know only too well the problems that many of their constituents face on a daily basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as though public transport is a readily available luxury. In many areas, sealed roads are still considered a luxury. I am glad that one of the first portfolio tasks the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has set himself and this government is to look at the needs of veterans and war widows and widowers in rural and remote locations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we talk about our debt of gratitude to the ex-service men and women of Australia, it is impossible to overlook the recipients of the Victoria Cross. Amendments contained in this bill will see the current allowance paid annually to the three surviving Australian VC recipients&mdash;Sir Roden Cutler, Mr Keith Payne and Mr Ted Kenna&mdash;increased from $250 to $2,700.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The heroism and selfless acts of bravery all VC recipients performed during combat are worthy of recognition. I do not mean to suggest that we should glorify war. In fact, I think it is very important that we remember and reflect on the mistakes of the past that led to war and conflict so that they are never repeated. But the actions of our VC recipients more often than not involved them putting their lives at great risk in attempting to save and/or protect other people's lives. This is something that should be remembered and honoured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The British government has recently increased the Victoria Cross allowance it pays from &pound;100 to &pound;1,300, backdated to 17 August 1995. The Australian allowance will also be backdated to 17 August 1995, ensuring that the financial acknowledgment of the valour of our veterans will now be no less than that paid by other governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that this bill contains amendments to correct anomalies in the defence service homes scheme. Eligibility for DSH assistance is to be extended to persons who served in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia&mdash;within the dates specified in schedule 2 to the Veterans' Entitlements Act <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1986&mdash;and to persons who first enlisted in the Defence Force on or before 14 May 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members would be aware that back in 1993 eligibility under the defence home owner scheme was extended to cover operational service in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia. However, operational service coverage was not provided under the DSH scheme. As a result, due to breaks in service in a small number of cases, some ADF personnel who enlisted before 15 May 1985 and who served in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia have not served the necessary period of six years service to be eligible for DSH assistance. This has been an unfortunate oversight and I am pleased that the government is taking steps to correct it. The amendments will ensure that the small number of veterans who have previously fallen through this gap will now be able to receive assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will also be amendments extending eligibility for DSH assistance to certain widowers of World War II servicewomen. According to the explanatory memorandum that was issued with this bill, these amendments remove the restrictions which prevent a widower of an eligible World War II servicewoman, who has been previously provided with initial assistance as an eligible person, from being eligible for another initial loan on the basis of his widower status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other amendment in relation to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 relates to the reduction of interest rates on new additional advances provided to a person under the DSH scheme. The reduction in interest rates on new additional advances under this scheme will be from 10 per cent to 6.85 per cent per annum. That is good news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although it is expected that this change will assist only a relatively small number of people, those whom it will affect will welcome this amendment. People who currently seek further advances because they did not take the initial maximum $25,000 loan advance at 6.85 per cent have to do so at an interest rate of 10 per cent per annum. This change will mean that eligible people can access further advances for such things as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7824"> home repairs and maintenance and do so at a significantly lower level of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is looking after our Defence Force service men and women at both ends of their careers. Earlier this year the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) introduced amendments to the defence home owner scheme which will benefit a large number of serving ADF personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments increase the loan limit available under the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance Act) 1990 from $40,000 to $80,000. Personnel who had previously accessed a loan did not miss out either. They were given the chance to increase their loan to that $80,000 mark if they wished. In addition, eligible persons and eligible spouses with joint loan entitlements are able to potentially increase their maximum combined loans from $80,000 to $160,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also introduced amendments to reduce the basic eligibility service period under the act from six to five years for members rendering full&hyphen;time service. Reservists were also given access to the loans scheme following completion of a basic period of eight years. These particular amendments have been warmly welcomed by the large number of Australian Defence Force personnel stationed in Townsville at Lavarack Barracks and RAAF Garbutt. The amendments in respect of the defence service home scheme contained in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996 will likewise be welcomed by Australia's veterans community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also seeks to amend anomalies in relation to funeral benefits. The background paper to this bill states that the current act provides for the payment of funeral benefits to the estate of certain deceased veterans, towards the funeral expenses of other veterans, and for a reasonable charge for transporting the deceased person in certain circumstances. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A payment for transportation expenses is currently not payable for a deceased veteran who is eligible for funeral benefits only by reason that he or she died in financial need.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill seeks to extend eligibility for benefits payable for a person who dies away from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> home in financial need. This benefit will apply to any applications made after 20 August 1996&mdash;budget night&mdash;as applications can be lodged up to 12 months after the death of a veteran.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this is a change that will be of particular comfort to veterans in rural and remote regional centres. It is a regrettable fact of life that people in the later stages of life need closer medical attention. For people in remote areas, those services are not always readily available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, Australia has always talked about the tyranny of distance in relation to trade with Europe and America. For many people in rural Queensland and rural and remote Australia, the tyranny of distance is an everyday fact of life. Great advances and improvements have been made over the years, particularly in the area of the Flying Doctor Service. Yet, time and time again, government after government has failed to adequately address one of the central problems: attracting doctors to and being able to keep them in regional and rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a veteran in a remote part of regional Australia falls seriously ill to the point of requiring hospitalisation&mdash;and many of our war veterans do come from these centres&mdash;that often means travelling large distances to access those services. Regrettably, they sometimes pass on alone and away from home and regrettably they sometimes are in circumstances of financial need. The changes in this bill address those needs. They are sensible changes, and I support them wholeheartedly. There are a number of other points worth addressing in this bill, because it is a wide&hyphen;ranging bill. I am sure my colleagues will address some of those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the fact that we do owe our veteran community a debt of gratitude. Every year I am amazed by the new interest that is shown in our veteran community. Every year on Anzac Day most of us have seen the crowds of young children growing and growing. Many of them have had grandparents and great&hyphen;grandparents who have fought in war, defending Australia and other countries. The renewed interest they show should be nurtured and treasured, for it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7825"> would be a shame if we allowed that interest to fade away. I am certain that it never will. The measures in this bill that is before the House at the moment certainly have the sentiments that I have just outlined. I commend the bill to this House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially I must take issue with a point made by the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). He expressed some disdain for the opposition having what he described as a `cargo cult' mentality. At the same time he said&mdash;and we unquestionably agree with his comment&mdash;that all Australians owe a debt of gratitude to our veteran community. That, of course, is very much the fact. Quite simply, you can't put a dollar value on the tremendous contribution and sacrifice that they made for our nation. It was a point stressed by the President of the United States in his historic address to this parliament. The contribution they made was not only to our nation but also to the cause of democracy around the world, which during this century has really been given life in a dramatic way in so many countries as a result of the efforts of human beings from around the world, including very much our own veteran community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also echo the sentiments of the shadow minister, who said that as you go around RSL clubs&mdash;certainly I have found it in my electorate&mdash;there is tremendous respect for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and, indeed, for the former minister, Mr Con Sciacca by both the veteran community and members of the armed forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have one primary policy when it comes to veterans&mdash;you don't save money at the expense of our veterans. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said in the context of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996 that it is necessary to look at the provisions of this bill against the totality of the infrastructure which exists in respect to aged care generally. I agree with that. If you ignore the totality of that infrastructure, these veterans measures risk being seen as just gestures in the face of an otherwise somewhat oppressive set of provisions and challenges now faced by our veterans community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, there is unquestionably a number of beneficial things in this bill: for instance, the benefits which are going to be paid in respect of our three surviving Victoria Cross awardees. I recall seeing the news when they were awarded the special transportation benefits in this parliament. It was an historic occasion where members of the House rose and gave those three men a standing ovation which was well and truly called for. So any recognition of the contribution they as special Australians have made is certainly welcome. Equally, the funeral benefits contained in the bill are welcome, as are extensions to the defence home owners scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Otherwise, it is not extremely difficult to detect those areas where there are detrimental impacts on the veterans community. They are contained in the financial impact statement in the bill and are described as `savings' for the government. Those are the matters which I would like to address again in the context of what is happening to the general veterans community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) described the fact that, by the year 2000, 60 per cent of the veterans community will be over 75 years of age. In fact, veterans make up about one&hyphen;quarter of the male population over 65 and seven per cent of women over that age are either veterans or war widows. Together they make up about 15 per cent of the total population over the age of 65. In other words, the infrastructure of the system in respect of aged care and benefits for senior citizens very much impacts upon the veterans community. I will not dwell on matters which have been the subject of debate both in matters of public importance and earlier in this debate, but the shadow minister and the member for Jagajaga referred to the need for senior citizens to face the issue of a nursing home entry contribution fee if they are going to go into any nursing home of reasonable quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, there may be nursing homes which do not charge that fee, but they will not be the nursing homes which are in demand and, regrettably, they will be the lesser standard nursing homes. From my perspective and that of the opposition, our veterans are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7826"> entitled to the very best of care. It will be those higher quality nursing homes which will inevitably, by the simple fact that they are in demand, take the opportunity to charge the nursing home entry contribution fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The income testing of recurrent subsidies will also fall heavily on the veterans community whereby they will lose 25c in the dollar above the pension&hyphen;free area of $98 a fortnight, up to a maximum I understand of $238. Equally, the member for Jagajaga has referred to the additional 50c per prescription under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It is a fact of life that, after the age of 75, it is frequently necessary for senior citizens, and indeed veterans, to purchase a number of prescriptions that will certainly eat into their fixed income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increased user charges on home and community care will also have a dramatic effect on veterans. The fact of the matter is that there are a very significant number of veterans living at home on their own and, of course, they are ageing rapidly. It is that sector of our population in particular which is going to use and need home and community care services. The ultimate burden that will fall on our veterans will largely depend upon whether state governments come in to fill the vacuum for the increase in these charges. But, if they do not, most certainly our veterans community is going to be hit very hard by those charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In addressing the specific areas where we disagree with the bill, the opposition also strongly objects to the amendments relating to earning credits. Previously the earning credit scheme enabled single pensioners an earning credit of $1,050 and couples $2,100 to offset earnings on employment before their pension entitlement was affected. In many ways, the scheme was not dissimilar from that applying to first-class athletes who attain high incomes during the years of their sporting successes and have the ability to, in some way, spread that over future taxation years. That scheme enabled veterans to take the benefit of short&hyphen;term engagements&mdash;which was consistent with both their health and the availability of job opportunities&mdash;without risking the administra tive nightmare of losing and then having to reapply for their pension entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition say that it is a very retrograde step indeed to penalise those veterans who are attempting to care for themselves and may wish to earn some additional income to have a holiday, for instance, or at this more demanding financial time of the year to buy Christmas presents. We say that is quite unfortunate and unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite a chronic indictment of the government that the scheme is being abolished because of difficulty which has been experienced in understanding the scheme. Certainly we do not expect members of the veterans community to be tax lawyers but, with some guidance by the department, veterans most certainly would have been able to come to terms with those benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statistics indicate that members of the veterans community are very avid readers and if time had been taken to explain these provisions they most certainly would have been more fully utilised. In that context, the opposition expresses very real concern with the fact that the government has reduced the resources available to the Department of Veterans' Affairs by 15 per cent. That restricts and limits the department's ability to inform people and to provide services to the veterans community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition also strongly opposes the amendments to change the method for calculating the period for which a veteran is precluded from receiving a pension entitlement after receiving lump sum compensation. Presently, a lump sum compensation payment receipt is divided by the average weekly male income, which is about $540, to work out the preclusion period. For instance, if a compensation payout of $50,000 were divided by the average weekly male earnings, it would result in a preclusion period of just under two years. By dividing that same lump sum figure of $50,000 by the maximum pension which is payable to a single person, which is $397, that preclusion period would be extended by an additional six months. We say that that is most harsh and quite unnecessary. If a veteran has suffered a disability or an injury, they are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7827"> entitled to additional sympathy; they do not need the government effectively being a parasite upon that compensation payment before providing well&hyphen;earned assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition also opposes the inclusion of all interest payments in calculating veterans' earnings. Interest will now be deemed to have been earned by veterans on their investments. Whereas currently the first $2,000 for singles and $4,000 for couples was exempt from deeming because it was below the threshold rate, those small and really quite trifling figures are now going to be included in the totality of earnings. On my research, and as referred to by the member for Jagajaga, very few financial institutions in fact pay interest at that deeming rate on such small sums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Jagajaga pointed out, the department's own figures indicate that some 121,000 allowees are going to be affected by that particular decision of the government. It unquestionably amounts to a broken promise, and that is regrettable. It is really penny pinching, and it is penny pinching in the face of what I and government members have referred to as the tremendous contribution the veterans community has made to this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is generally conceded that the former Labor Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca, did a tremendous job in looking after the interests of veterans. In 1996 he introduced a $50 million package to provide a number of benefits to the veterans community, having regard to the fact that they are now moving into their senior years. Those steps were contained in a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">As time goes by: Continuing the commitment</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is regrettable that, while some measures in this bill do benefit the veterans community, the bill does not go nearly as far as required. For instance, a 1994 task force report indicated that there were two major policy issues that should be adopted in respect of veterans. One was the recognition of veterans as a special community of interest in aged care planning and the second was the establishment of a three tier consultation process between the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Human Services and Health and ex-service organisations to devel op aged care priorities. The government has unquestionably acted contrary to those suggestions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of their age, veterans have been hit even harder by those things which I have referred to&mdash;higher pharmaceutical benefits contributions and nursing home fees. In respect of the coordination between departments to improve the level of service provision, the government has actually reduced the resources available to the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, health is a major concern to veterans. A recent survey has thrown up that at least a third of veterans suffer from illnesses. Indeed, they said that they experienced `a lot of bother' from their health problems. Health is an imperative and coordinated health is a chronic need for veterans. Equally, 42 per cent of veterans believed that things could be done to improve their health. That is certainly an area I would like to see the government concentrate upon. Prevention is always cheaper, certainly much more successful and obviously much more human than simply trying to put medication into the equation after an illness has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see the government do much more for health care for veterans. Indeed, the former Labor government before losing office was in the process of considering extending the gold health care card which currently exists for World War I veterans and World War II veterans. Given that they make up the majority of the veteran community, it is really now a time for the parliament as a whole to look very carefully at that. I think, well and truly, World War II veterans have earned the right to have that gold health care card to enable them to access obviously needed health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that came out of the survey of veterans was their strong desire to remain in their homes. I would like this government to give specific thought to that measure given its increased charges for home and community services. Things like the home nursing visits and meals on wheels services should be looked at as an essentiality for veterans rather than a privilege. I believe the government could also do a lot of work in that respect.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7828">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, while there are some benefits in this bill, it is unfortunate that there are any savings to be made at the expense of our veterans community. Quite frankly, we consider that the government should be deplored where they have done  that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996 introduces the first instalment of the government's veterans' affairs budget commitments. By reviewing and correcting certain anomalies in veterans' entitlements, the government has been able to make certain amendments to the relevant statutes which will improve the wellbeing of our veterans and their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments honour key pre&hyphen;election promises to the veteran community. The promises delivered during the election were very important to the electorate of Boothby. Containing, as it does, the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital, Boothby has a significant veteran community which includes two veterans of World War I.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said that the legacy of a war lasts 100 years after peace has been declared. That is to say, long after the conflict they served in has become a memory, long after the captains and the kings depart, veterans and their dependants not only deserve our gratefulness and appreciation but also require our support and care. To highlight this, in 1991 the Veterans Administration in the United States actually had a Confederate widow in its care&mdash;125 years after Appomattox. In the same year the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> featured a profile on Australia's veterans from all wars which included a 112&hyphen;year&hyphen;old man who was a survivor of the Boer War and who claimed to have known Breaker Morant personally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1990 Australia had 120 surviving veterans of World War I&mdash;incredibly 60 of them were fit enough to return to Gallipoli for the dawn service on 25 April 1990. I found that service very moving and I am sure, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Quick, knowing that your father was an original Anzac, you would have too.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has informed the House, the last surviving Australian veteran of the Anzac Day landings, Ted Matthews, turned 100 years old last month and was visited by the Prime Minister in Sydney. All of these examples highlight my contention that the responsibility a country owes its veterans and their dependants long outlives the governments who committed the nation to that conflict. With that in mind, all members of our community should appreciate and respect the sacrifices that veterans and their dependents have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key features of this bill is the proposal to amend the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. Put simply, the amendments are designed to extend eligibility for defence service home assistance to those who served in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defence service home scheme provides financial benefits to certain people who have served in the defence forces. The main benefit available under this scheme is interest subsidies. The maximum loan available is $25,000 with the loan repayable over 25 years. For new borrowers, the interest rate is currently fixed at 6.85 per cent for the term of the loan. Under an agreement between the government and Westpac, the government provides a subsidy to the bank which provides the low interest rate loans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where a person has taken less than the maximum amount of the loan, they may request an additional advance. Currently, section 33 of the Defence Services Homes Act 1918 provides that the rate of interest for an additional advance is 10 per cent. In the current interest rate climate with interest rates having fallen to such a low level and housing affordability being its highest in 20 years the rate of 10 per cent is not competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 4 of schedule 2 will substitute a new section 33 into that act. Under the proposal, the following rates will apply: if the person's current loan is subject to the 6.85 per cent interest rate, that rate will apply to an additional advance; if the person's current loan is subject to the 3.75 per cent interest rate, which applied prior to the 6.85 per cent rate, and they have already received an additional <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7829"> advance at the 10 per cent rate, then additional advances up to $10,000 will be subject to the 10 per cent rate; additional advances between $10,000 and $13,000 will be subject to a 7.25 per cent rate; and amounts in excess of $13,000 will be subject to the 3.75 per cent rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As stated before, eligibility under the scheme is to be extended to people who first served on or before 14 May 1985 and who served in the operational areas of Iraq, Kuwait and other gulf countries, Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia during Australia's deployment to those areas. This aims to address the situation where the person had broken service to complete the six-year eligibility criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, a widower who is eligible in his own right to receive a loan and whose wife was also eligible for a loan will be able to access an advance in either his own right or as a widower. The change will apply to widowers of World War II servicewomen and corrects an anomaly where access to the advance is available to widows of World War II servicemen but is not available to relevant widowers. The amendments mean that people will be able to use these advances for purposes such as home repairs or modifications without having to pay what is effectively a penalty interest rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 10 years, there have been several occasions on which this nation has recognised the service of their veterans. Several of these stick in my mind as occasions when the nation proudly recognised the service of our veterans. I think the welcome home March for Vietnam veterans in 1987 was a turning point in the way that Australians recognised service in that war. Similarly, the establishment in 1992 of a memorial for the Vietnam War and those 500 servicemen who did not return was very moving when I saw it on television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit this year to Long Tan and Nui Dat on August 18 by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), himself a Vietnam veteran, and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) commemorated the service of our Defence Force personnel in that conflict. Two moving ceremonies recognised the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> service of our World War I veterans. One I have mentioned previously was the dawn service at Anzac Cove in 1990, and the other one was in France in 1993 which commemorated the 75th anniversaries of the Anzac landings and the armistice. On both those occasions, World War I veterans aged between 93 and 103 returned to the beaches and the fields which had forged them, which had seared them in their youth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the Australia Remembers campaign was a civic highlight for many groups and individuals in Boothby, as a number of ceremonies and functions recognised the service of those who fought and served in World War II. As the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) has already mentioned in this debate, one of the interesting things to see was how many young people voluntarily attended that ceremony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the highlights for me was a dinner held by the Mitcham council which was attended by a World War I veteran as well as many who served in World War II. When he was introduced, they said, `That is him standing at the back.' While people were delighted to have a World War I veteran there, they were amazed that, rather than sitting down, he was standing listening to all the speeches, something that those who are a bit younger would prefer not to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So veterans play a key role in Australian life and society. They deserve the gratitude and respect of their country. Australia's involvement in conflicts has shaped us as a nation. Australian art reflects the way that war has touched our society. In the 1970s and 1980s, Australian films gained a reputation for well&hyphen;made, high quality movies, with pictures such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Breaker Morant</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gallipoli</EMPHASIS> which focused on Australia's involvement in war, highlighting how horrific war is for those involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David Malouf's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Great World</EMPHASIS> looked at how war has touched families in Australia over a period of 80 years&mdash;a period of three generations. I suspect that some people overseas, especially in the United Kingdom, still think that Nevil Shute's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Town Like Alice</EMPHASIS> is an accurate reflection of what life is like in Australia at present. Eric Bogle's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">And <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7830"> the Band Played Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS> is one of the most evocative folk songs that I have heard about Australia's Anzac tradition. And it is incredible to think that Eric Bogle wrote that song after living in Australia for only two years. After such a short time in Australia, he was able to write what I think is a quintessential Australian anti&hyphen;war song.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1960s there was a feeling that somehow the Anzac tradition glorified war; that the Anzac Day marches were about the glorification of war. I have never thought that. I thought they are more about remembering how horrific war is and how much it must be avoided. Alan Seymour's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Day of the Year</EMPHASIS>  highlighted the cynicism of a younger generation and the disdain they held for such institutions as the Anzac Day march and the Returned Services League. It is a fair question to ask how a younger generation in the 1990s perceives Australia's traditions and how they feel about Australia's veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already mentioned, one of the surprising things about the Australia Remembers campaign was to see how many people in their teens, in their 20s and in their 30s were attending the Australia Remembers marches and the Australia Remembers functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three years ago, I visited Turkey and I made, as many Australians do, a pilgrimage to Gallipoli. Walking around well-known names like the Nek, Lone Pine, Anzac Cove and the trenches which are still there at Quinns Post and Courtneys Post, I met 20 or 30 other Australians, most of them in their 20s. Coming from a generation that has been spared direct contact with war or a major conflict, what I defected amongst those young Australians was a need to understand why Australia was fighting overseas in World War I and a feeling that it was important as an Australian to visit Gallipoli; that Gallipoli was an important part of what it is to be an Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the day I was there, few articulated why it was important to visit but most knew that it was. As we approach the centenary of Federation, it is evident that young Australians are still looking for positive role models and heroes in our history. Many Australians <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have visited overseas destinations like Villers&hyphen;Bretonneux, the village which in 1918 the Australians were able to save. After World War I the reconstruction of that town was largely paid for by the people of the state of Victoria. Even now you can go to schoolrooms in Villers-Bretonneux where there are signs that say `N'oubliez jamais l'Australie!'&mdash;never forget Australia!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the veterans of the Kokoda track have an important place in the pantheon of Australian heroes. What that does for me is demonstrate a wider interest in, and a respect for, the deprivations endured and the achievements made by our veterans who defended freedom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working at the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital in the centre of my electorate, I had the opportunity to care for many veterans of World War II and even occasionally a veteran of World War I, and I was able to gain an understanding of their special needs. One of the things that I have enjoyed as a representative member and, prior to that, as a candidate has been having the opportunity to meet with the members of the different RSL branches in my electorate, their presidents, their committees, and usually to have a dinner or enjoy the dawn service with them. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

Con Sciacca, for all he contributed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7831"> in the last parliament to the Australia Remembers campaign. That campaign, of course, was something which enjoyed support from both sides of the House as it then was. I think everyone concedes that Con, as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, did an outstanding job in developing the year-long celebrations that surrounded Australia Remembers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly pleased that we have a lasting memorial, if you like, to Australia Remembers. We have stage 1 of the special memorial gardens at Mount Druitt. They are beautiful now, and I am sincerely hoping that the RSL and the council will not forget to develop the further stages so that they will be not only as beautiful as they are now but quite outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I apologise for raising a couple of things that may seem of a slight minor nature. However, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), in his second reading speech, indicated that there were a number of health initiatives he was taking that would not require legislation. One of those was the provision of multifocal lenses for veterans who prefer to use them. I must say that I am very pleased at this. I can happily report to the House that I am aware that one of my constituents, who is responsible for a rather significantly large file and whose name I will not mention, has already got his multifocal glasses which, indeed, his specialist required him to have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am always interested in health issues surrounding veterans, and I must say that I am really concerned about a discussion I have had with one of the veterans in my electorate&mdash;and I will not mention his name either. He attends at the Nepean hospital where he is required to fill out a Veterans' Affairs entitled patient declaration form. You might say that there is nothing too strange in that. But there are a few things that my veteran has drawn to my attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, in the form, where it says `I elect to be treated by doctors nominated by the hospital, or doctor and doctors to whom this doctor refers me&mdash;`doctor' being blank&mdash;the hospital always ticks the box that says `doctors nominated by the hospital'. It is my understanding that this does not conform with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the agreements reached with the New South Wales Health Department about the way veterans should be treated in hospitals. I would be most grateful if the officials at the table, or the minister, would be prepared to look into this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing is that my constituent is required to provide details of his name, number and Veterans' Affairs number. But the form states `If the department refuses to cover the costs of my hospital treatment, I acknowledge my liability to meet the hospital accommodation charge of'&mdash;and there is a blank&mdash;`per day if I elect to be treated by a private doctor' and he is forced to sign that, and the amount of money is not put in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this ticking and his being forced to sign this declaration, we are not really looking after veterans who may be going to this particular hospital. I would be interested to know if this is required in all hospitals. I believe the last thing that veterans would want to do when about to have treatment they believe they are entitled to would be to start to worry about whether they are covered for that treatment or not. Maybe this action is appropriate the first time a veteran visits the hospital of his choice&mdash;maybe. But this happens every time he visits the hospital of his choice. I just do not think that is good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret to say that veterans are going to become victims of the new nursing home arrangement that the government is putting in place. I suppose this is a little close to the bone for me, given the recent passing of my father, who was not a veteran. But this is one of the grave mistakes this government is making&mdash;a decision of complete indifference to frail age and inflicted upon veterans and war widows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every time we on this side want to raise the issue, the government says, `We're only mirroring what you did with hostel care.' It is true that we placed an up-front fee on hostel care. But, if one sets aside the specialist dementia units in my state, when people move into hostels they have a choice about accommodation; they are not being forced into a hostel and indeed they are capable of supporting themselves out in the community. When <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7832"> a veteran or a war widow goes into a nursing home, it is because they have been assessed by an aged care team as requiring that care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, in relation to nursing home care for veterans, there is no element of assessing the financial status of a veteran&mdash;whether he is a wealthy veteran, or a poor veteran, or a middle&hyphen;class veteran or a battler. Once that medical assessment goes through, he is then in a queue and it is first come, first served. Under this new arrangement they have to find $26,000 up&hyphen;front, and it is said that the nursing homes draw down only $2,600 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any veteran has full access to all available beds irrespective of their wealth or lack of wealth at the moment. In hostels there are certain provisions for the financially disadvantaged and some beds are set aside, because there is an element of choice in hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But when people go into nursing homes they do not often go into the nursing home they end up staying the most time in. The point is that their spouse, or their family or the community, cannot maintain them in their current situation. They require specialist care and go into the nursing home. They may be in a nursing home for 12 months and pay $26,000 up&hyphen;front, with $2,600 drawn down by the organisation providing the care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they decide to move to what their relatives may consider a better or more convenient nursing home, it is another $26,000 upfront, with $2,600 drawn down a year. What if there is some change in family circumstances? If the family moves to Queensland, are they going to leave their relative in a nursing home in New South Wales? No. They will certainly want to try to move the relative closer to where they can visit and be involved with him. If the veteran has been in a nursing home for three years, it is $26,000 up&hyphen;front, with $2,600 being drawn down every year. When the veteran moves to Queensland, it is another $26,000 up&hyphen;front. It is a very inhumane system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is saying, `When it comes to veterans, we'll introduce a bit of flexibility; you'll be able to pay a monthly fee.' That sounds pretty reasonable&mdash;giving choice and a bit of flexibility. It sounds pretty reasonable, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> except when you look at it. If they are paying that fee on a monthly basis, they are going to have to find an additional $80 over and above the basic pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you what this $26,000 up&hyphen;front fee is going to do to a lot of veterans and their families. Let us say that a veteran is living with his spouse and they do not have the $26,000. The aged care assessment team has assessed them as requiring nursing home care&mdash;often the veteran is kept at home for perhaps a little too long, so the spouse's health starts to suffer. They go to a nursing home and ask whether they can be placed there. The nursing home will say, `Are you able to pay the $26,000 up&hyphen;front?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they have to have a bed and have to pay the $26,000, or the partner or wife has to sell the house to provide the $26,000, I know what will happen. They will sell the house, because at the end of the day they will want the best care for their spouse or partner. When you have an expert team, backed up by your local GP, telling you, `This is our assessment; unfortunately the veteran needs to be in a nursing home,' you are going to do everything in your power to do it. I really think this is sad. The last thing we should be doing to our veteran community and war widows is giving them unnecessary worry as their health declines in the latter years of their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think a lot of us can accept that there needs to be cost recovery, greater efficiencies and all of those sorts of things. But this $26,000 up-front fee is not going to provide one extra nursing home bed for a veteran or a war widow. That is the tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not ideological about this. I have some very good nursing homes in my electorate. They are run by some of the religious and migrant communities and they provide an excellent service. But it is also true to say that there are many nursing homes that are run for profit&mdash;at the end of the day, they have to meet a bottom line. Unfortunately, in some instances that bottom line leads to a lesser service. In relation to nursing homes operated for profit, I cannot for the life of me see how this $26,000 up-front fee and the drawing down of $2,600 are going to do anything more than line the pockets of the proprietors.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7833">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already spoken in this place about my objections to these measures in relation to the community at large. When members of parliament are gathered as we are to look at the situation of veterans, we have an extra responsibility to take account of and note of their welfare. I believe that history will prove us right on this side of the House: that the veteran community is going to be poorly served by the ruthless regime being introduced that requires an up&hyphen;front amount of money for nursing home placement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If government members want to say to me that our system was not perfect, I accept that. If they want to say that changes need to be made, I will accept that too. I am more than happy to work with them and to look at ways in which we can provide more nursing home beds and high quality service more effectively and efficiently. We are putting this impost on war veterans and war widows at the time in their lives when they need to go into a nursing home, discriminating amongst them on the basis of whether or not they have $26,000, and perhaps forcing some of them to sell their houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that, in my mother's case, if this had been in we would not have had to sell the house because we could have found the money. But in my own heart I know that, if my mother had been confronted with that decision, that is what she would have done. I would like to think that, as a family member, I could have played a part; but I know deep down that what people want for their partners&mdash;and do not forget they have usually been married for a long time&mdash;is the best possible service. They will sell their homes and live with relatives just to meet this payment. If that is the outcome the government wants, fair enough, they will be getting it. But I really do not think it is. As I have said, I think that if we are not concerned about the frail aged in general&mdash;and I think we ought to be&mdash;let us take special note of the impact this will have on veterans and war widows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say a few other things about this measure. I note that it has changed the deeming rate on accounts and allegedly simplified it. I think the government have simplified it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by moving a free area as far as deeming is concerned. I think both sides of parliament understand that we need to have deeming; that is, it really is foolish when citizens who receive government benefits have quite significant sums of money sitting in accounts earning no interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to be careful when dealing with an older population&mdash;and by that I in no way mean any disrespect to them. I think the most common form of so-called liquid asset they hold is bank accounts or credit union accounts. They are very conservative people. Members of this House may have investment strategies and retirement strategies, but these people have usually been through a depression, which has made them very conservative about how they handle money. So, if we deem something at five per cent but banks do not offer interest rates on accounts at five per cent, we are effectively taxing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the officials are at the table. Could the minister indicate when he sums up this debate whether the super investors in society who are very skilled at transferring money from bank accounts into shares, debentures, futures and a bit of property are the clientele we are talking about? I am sure some veterans and war widows, by the way, would do that, but what is the normal pattern of veterans and war widows in relation to handling what I think are, by and large, very modest sums of money? If it is the case that they use bank accounts and credit card accounts&mdash;and I believe it is&mdash;and we as parliamentarians insist that they be deemed to be earning five per cent interest from those accounts, we are effectively taxing them. It is an extra impost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7834"> Whether I am on this side or that side of the House, I would not want to stand up in this place and say that I believe in taxing the modest savings of veterans and war widows. I would be particularly interested in the minister informing the House in his summing up, if he would be kind enough to do so, whether or not this is the case and, if it is, whether he is satisfied with this particular measure in the bill. Perhaps we could take a microscopic look at what is happening to veterans and war widows in relation to deem ing, and the lessons learned there may be applied to the wider pensioner population of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996 honours key pre-election promises to our veteran community. These measures will provide for simpler and more flexible entitlements, and the major initiatives cover the areas of health care, housing, rehabilitation, compensation and commemoration. Anomalies will be removed from the system, making it fairer and more efficient to administer, and service delivery to veterans will be improved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government quite rightly gives due recognition to our veteran community for they are the ones who, in the prime of their lives, served their country so unselfishly. As a mother of a 23-, 20- and 17-year-old, I can understand how difficult it must have been for the mothers then, for our now older veterans were about those ages when they were doing so much for their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill includes significant changes to the defence services home scheme, including a reduction in the interest rate from 10 per cent per annum to 6.85 per cent per annum for new additional advances. This will enable many veterans and their families to undertake necessary home repairs and modifications without having to pay what is effectively a penalty interest rate. I understand that around 500 veterans per year access this facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we think of the members of the veteran community, we often conjure up images of veterans from the world wars or campaigns fought in the Asian theatre since 1945. But it should not be forgotten that the veteran community is a continuously expanding community. This bill recognises the peacekeeping activities of the members of our Cambodian, Yugoslavian and Somalian contingents who first enlisted in the defence forces before May 1996. It should not be forgotten that these veterans have been involved in these operations for many of the same reasons as veterans from other conflicts&mdash;namely, the preservation of peace, justice and democracy&mdash;and they rightly deserve the same recognition. This bill will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expand the defence services homes eligibility to those new members of the veteran community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a matter of equity, the current anomaly whereby World War II widows who were also ex-service women can receive a second loan from the defence services home scheme but widowers of World War II ex-service women cannot will be corrected. These men will now be entitled to a second loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides an opportunity for some veterans to increase their incomes. In his second reading speech the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deeming rules will be changed to make them less complex. For money held as cash or on deposit, a deemed interest rate, currently five per cent, will be applied to the first $2,000 for single pensioners and $4,000 for couples. This change will simplify pensioner notification requirements because individuals will no longer need to advise about small interest fluctuations. This has been perceived as intrusive. For some pensioners the change will provide an opportunity to increase their overall income.</PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of a minimum variation regime will reduce the amount of administrative contact between the veterans and the department over small changes in income and assets. This should reduce the frequency of what can often be a frustrating or stressful necessity for some veterans, especially the more elderly. This measure will also reduce the administrative overheads for the department. At present, the rounding amount is only 10c and this will be increased to $1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recognition of their duty performed above and beyond what would normally be expected, the three Australians still living who have been awarded the Victoria Cross will have their allowances increased from $250 to $2,700, in line with recent increases made by the British government. There is no reason why our VC awardees should receive any less than their British counterparts. It is expected that there will be a flow-on effect to the George Cross allowance, which is administered by the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7835"> This bill also recognises the role played by veterans organisations in representing the interests of veterans, especially in the repatriation claims system. Staff of these organisa tions can currently access training programs on veterans' entitlements and services, but this increase in funding will now allow staff members to be increased thereby increasing the efficiency of a repatriation claims process. It will also increase the level of support veterans receive from their own community, which I believe should be the objective of any government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also no longer make it a requirement for war widows to advise the department about the purpose for which any advance payment of pension is required. Often this type of assistance is requested in times when the families of veterans are already under some pressure. The end of this type of intrusion by the government should be welcomed. A lump sum advance of up to $500, to be repaid over a period of up to six months, may be made eligible to service pensioners and income support supplement recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An anomaly will be corrected in relation to funeral benefits. A payment will be able to be made for costs associated with the transportation of the remains of a veteran who dies in financial need away from home when obtaining approved medical treatment. This assistance is available for certain other veterans who have died away from home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to actually be speaking on a day which will give me the opportunity to make a very special announcement. It is not often that things work out so conveniently on speakers lists. Today I am pleased and proud to announce that the government has provided a grant of $7,000, under our commemorative activities program, to enable a memorial to be built in Adelaide in honour of ex-service women of World War II. I thank the minister for ensuring that, after some years of trying, this grant application has finally attracted the attention and support which it rightly deserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of service women in World War II was critical to Australia's war effort and, as our social history now tells us, was important to the emergence of women as equal participants in the work force. But women who served in World War II were not revolutionaries searching for a cause on which to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wage a campaign. They were responding with pride and courage to the call of their country. That is a response which we honour and respect today and always.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's commitment to the memorial in Adelaide is testament to the community support and dedication which has driven the project. In particular, I acknowledge the personal contribution made by Mrs Coral Farrelly. The government's $10.4 million commemorative activities program will be officially launched early next year, but already we have seen some major funding commitments made&mdash;in particular, $100,000 for the national nurses memorial, to be sited on Anzac Parade, Canberra; and $150,000 for a national service women's memorial, to be sited in the sculpture garden of the Australian War Memorial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned Coral Farrelly. I would just like to say a bit more about Coral and some of her activities. Mrs Coral Farrelly OAM is the President of the Council of United Ex-Service Women in South Australia. She has been campaigning for this memorial for some time. I first met her when the previous minister, Con Sciacca, introduced her to me early in 1995 at the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital. She was telling him how badly she needed this memorial. He in turn was saying to me, `Here is a local woman member of parliament who can do something about it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The memorial recognises those women who served Australia during the war years at home and overseas. Coral Farrelly has lobbied on behalf of her council. It was considered appropriate in the year of Australia Remembers to have some form of recognition because there is no memorial in South Australia. There are the playing fields, but no actual monument to commemorate those women who gave the best years of their lives to serve Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess at some stage all of us attempt to access funds from one particular area or another and try to negotiate deals involving state, local and Commonwealth governments and feel the frustration, as I have, over quite a period of time of trying to link it all up, case manage it and make it come together. I pay tribute to Con Sciacca for the work that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7836"> he did in the year of Australia Remembers last year. I have heard others do that today. Coral is quite an extraordinary woman. I am so pleased that this is coming together and that it has fallen into place. It has fallen into place because of negotiations with the Adelaide City Council, which will put up $2,000 for the project. I am hopeful, after the application of a little more of the power of persuasion on my part, that they will perhaps throw in the grading and levelling of the ground, which will be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state government in South Australia has put up $5,000 through their `art for public places' project. As well as the money, we have been able to benefit from the expertise. The Ex-Prisoners of War Association and the women's auxiliary, hearing of our activities, have found $700 and the 2/3rd Battalion of the machine gunners have put up $300. That adds up to $15,000. With some of the work, hopefully, being done for a good price, I am sure it can be well achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coral and her girls, as she refers to them, have had a lot to say about the design, working cooperatively with `art for public places'. There will be four faces featured on this monument. The faces will have the navy hat, the army hat, the air force hat and the nurses veil. I am very excited that it has finally come into place. I am hopeful that it will be erected by Anzac Day next year, because it will be situated north of Government House on the lawns facing out on to King William Street. Coral and her girls were particularly anxious that it be situated along there so that when the Anzac march takes place down King William Street it will be there for all to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is particularly important that the memorial be in an accessible place so that our younger generation and their children will be able to view it in the years ahead. That is the very special thing about monuments and memorials. As we have said before&mdash;in fact, veterans themselves have said before&mdash;it is not to glorify war but is a reminder of the sacrifices made by veterans, our ex-service men and women, and to remind future generations that war is not worth it and that peace should be worked for.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also pleased to be able to have this opportunity and time remaining to me to say what a great pleasure it has been for me to mix with the ex-service community in South Australia&mdash;the veteran community. It is always a learning curve for any member of parliament because of the experiences they have not only in this place but particularly in their electorate. My father was a member of the air force and fought in New Guinea in the Second World War. My late uncle Frank was in the army. My brother's name went into the draw for national service during the Vietnam War. His marble did not come up but that of many of my friends did. I remember them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Last year's Australia Remembers year and, in particular, my own experience with the ex-service community, has been very special to me. I was elected to the federal parliament in March 1993. In April of that year I attended my first Anzac dawn service at the Enfield RSL Club. I understand that I was the first member for Adelaide there since Chris Hurford. That caused some excitement. People such as Ray Green, Morrie Stanford and others there have remained my friends ever since. It is like going home when I go back there. I recall that it was there that I met Ian Dunn, the new state president of the RSL in South Australia, and his wonderful wife, both who contribute so much to their veteran community. I pay tribute to all those people. I am pleased to support this bill and commend it to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to talk to some of the more substantive proposals. I might as well do it now, rather than come down a second time later on. I will be extremely brief. We are fundamentally opposed to a number of the key measures contained in this higher education legislation. We see the amendments agreed to by the Senate as very minor amelioratives to the government's proposed changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most significant amendment is the Harradine proposition in relation to the reduction in the HECS free payment threshold. That was one of the major items in the bill, producing savings over the forward estimates years in excess of $800 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Harradine proposition inserts another provision, the effect of which is that HECS debts are not repayable in a particular year if <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a person is either exempt from paying a Medicare levy or eligible to pay a reduced rate of Medicare levy. The practical effect is to produce a number of thresholds which are higher than the government's proposals and which go up by a couple of thousand dollars for each child. On the face of it that looks rather attractive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that we are no longer talking about the taxable income of the individual HECS debtor; we are talking about the joint income of the HECS debtor and his or her spouse. When that is taken into account, the measure becomes far less beneficial. So much so that, on the figures provided to the Senate in the debate last night, the government stands to lose over the four years of the forward estimates only some $50 million of the $800 million that it intended to achieve in savings through the reduction of HECS thresholds. In other words, the government continues to get about 94 per cent of the originally proposed savings. From that statistic alone, it is clear that the degree of relief provided by the Harradine proposition is fairly slight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the problem with the Harradine proposition is that it reflects an unrealistic view of social reality. It is hard to envisage there being many households of graduates with spouses or de facto spouses and some dependants on the sorts of incomes relevant to this discussion&mdash;the low to mid $20,000&mdash;where there is not a second earner bringing in at least a few thousand dollars. That is the main reason why the cost of the measure is so slight, when compared with the government's proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the bulk of people for whom HECS debts are relevant are either single or have few children, the degree of relief is pretty derisory at the end of the day. We do not see this Harradine proposal as in any way a significant offset to the negative impact of the government's proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not going to be opposing the government's incorporation into the legislation of some specific provisions relating to the conditions for charging fees. We still say that the guidelines in relation to that ought to be disallowable, but there is nothing in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7838"> amendments coming back from the Senate which we will be seeking to oppose. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996, when looked at in isolation, may appear fair to veterans but, when looked at in the budget context as a whole, the effect on veterans will be extremely unfair. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in his portfolio summary on the budget said that the budget demonstrates a strong and unequivocal commitment of the coalition to the veterans who have sacrificed so much for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this country. In fact, measures brought in with the budget&mdash;including up-front fees for nursing homes, increases in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and home and community care, as well as the most unkind cut of all, the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program&mdash;show a definite lack of commitment by this government to the veterans community. So much for gratitude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the First World War, 59,258 Australians died for our country. The effect of this sacrifice in the First World War was felt by every family in Australia at the time. Indeed, Australia's contribution in that war was proportionately larger than that of any other country in what was, in those days, the British empire. Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, would like to bring back the British empire. Fortunately, like the horrors of the First World War, the empire has gone now too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sacrifices that Australians made in the First World War have been repeated in wars and conflicts many times since then. We remember those sacrifices that our fellow Australians made on days like Anzac Day and Remembrance Day. Australia has undertaken to hold true to the memories of those who served and died by doing our best for those who returned from the conflicts&mdash;and those people often never recover from the conflict&mdash;and for their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is with sadness that I rise in this debate today to draw the attention of the House to those aspects of the government's programs in this budget which will badly affect the veterans community. This bill is just a little bit of a smokescreen by the government to pretend that it has actually done something. The budget decision on nursing home entry, for instance, is expected to raise $130 million per year from frail, sick and elderly Australians, including veterans. If the government genuinely felt any gratitude or commitment to veterans, one would have thought that it might have exempted veterans from the nursing home charge. But no. A lot of the people who will pay this charge will be veterans. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7839">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget decision to force those in need of nursing home care to find the money up-front is an attack on people at a very vulnerable stage of their lives. We can find in the papers that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) revealed in this House earlier this week that, if a veteran is living with his or her spouse in their family home and one of them has to go into a nursing home, they might be required to sell their home so that they can put their spouse into a nursing home. This is a person who fought for their country. What is this government's answer to them in the final years of their life? Sell your house to go into a nursing home. So much for gratitude by this government to the people who fought to keep us free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my constituents, Fred Jubb&mdash;who lives in Kingsgrove and was a member of the 2nd/12th Infantry Battalion&mdash;said to me that he thought this was a terribly mean thing for the government to do. That battalion was part of the 18th Infantry Brigade which inflicted the first land defeat on the Japanese in World War II at Milne Bay. So he and his colleagues actually began the roll back of the invasion of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the government say to them? If you are old and sick now, you had better cough up $26,000 or $50,000. If you go from a hostel into a nursing home, you might have to pay it twice. If you do not have the money&mdash;even though you fought for your country, even though you may have been injured and have carried that wound with you all your life&mdash;sell your house and put your spouse into rented accommodation, because that is the only way you will get into a nursing home.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or go into debt. The Prime Minister said to go into debt.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4I4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague the member for Cunningham says, the answer of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to this was that they can go into debt. I would have thought that the debt there should have been the country's debt to them. The Prime Minister's answer to this for veterans is, if you or your spouse are ill and need nursing home care, you had better go into debt to pay the up-front fee. I think it is extremely mean <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if the government is going to make veterans pay this fee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government intends to raise half a billion dollars from reform of aged care, and it is going to make a further saving of $88 million from additional user charges for home and community care facilities. It is obvious that the veterans community will be substantially hurt by that cost&hyphen;cutting measure of the government through a reduction in the entitlements. As my colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) pointed out in this House earlier this week, people who are in need of home and community care will find that the costs will leave them very little from their pension if they are going to have to meet these extra charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take a very significant interest in the home and community care program because in the early 1980s I was the chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, whose inquiry into aged care facilities was the vehicle that put forward the proposal for the home and community care program. We believed that was necessary so that people could have a choice about whether they, in their frail and declining years, went into a nursing home or received help to stay in their own home to get on with their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is going to charge people more for this. The effect of that will be that it will force more people into nursing homes. It will force veterans who fought for their country to have to make a choice about staying in their own home or having to sell that home. We as a government want to help people to stay in their own home. If a person or their spouse needs to go into a nursing home, the current government is going to force people to sell their home. There is a very dramatic difference in the approach of the Labor Party, which wants to help people, and the current coalition government, which wants to penalise veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The veterans are the people who fought to keep this country the way it is. Indeed, it is the injuries that those people received during the war which may have forced them to need nursing home care now. They might not have needed to go into a nursing home otherwise. So the government's gratitude and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7840"> government's commitment is: go into debt, as the Prime Minister said, or sell your house. It must really leave a bad taste in these people's mouths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The St George and Canterbury districts of my electorate have a very high concentration of people who depend on services offered by the home and community care program. Proportionately, there is an overrepresentation of people in my electorate who are veterans. The home and community care program has enhanced their independence, security and quality of life. But what the government is going to do now will make those veterans pay more. It will reduce their quality of life. In their young years they fought in the First World War, they fought in Korea or Malaya or in Vietnam. Now that they have got to the stage of needing some help and assistance, the government says, `It doesn't matter about the debt we owe you. We're going to charge you more now.' Rather than the government putting up the costs of programs such as the home and community care scheme, meals on wheels, home maintenance and things like that for veterans, I think the government should be showing a little bit of compassion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, 350 people use the meals on wheels program in Canterbury and 200 in Hurstville. They will either have to pay more or decide not to get the service. Elderly veterans whose health has declined&mdash;often because of war related matters&mdash;will, in some circumstances, now have to make the choice of whether they have five meals a week or seven. I think that is disgraceful. It is the same thing with the increase in the pharmaceutical benefits concessions. The patient contribution will affect a group of people on relatively small fixed incomes. Although the 50c increase may not seem very large to people in the government&mdash;the minister is earning $150,000 a year&mdash;it particularly is to elderly people, particularly those veterans who need a wide variety of medication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's axing in the budget of the Commonwealth dental program is perhaps one of the cruelest cuts. It will hurt veterans. Now a poor digger from Canterbury won't even be able to get his dentures fixed at the Canterbury Dental Clinic, as the government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have stopped that too. They have cut out the emergency vouchers. Vets will now have to pay about $180 to get a cavity filled in their teeth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the House can see, this phoney statement by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that `Australia's debt to its ex&hyphen;service men and women has been acknowledged in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget with the honouring of key pre&hyphen;election promises to the veterans community'&mdash;that is what the minister said&mdash;is a fabrication. It is an unkind and dishonest fabrication. The minister is going out there and saying to veterans, `Look, we've really enhanced things. We've delivered on what we promised.' The truth is that when the government were going to the election they never went out there and told people about some of the things they were going to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they had told people in the veterans community, `We're going to thank you very much for the contribution you made in defending your country by slugging you an up&hyphen;front fee in excess of $26,000 per annum if you or your spouse want to go into a nursing home,' I think they would have got a pretty resounding no. If they had told the veterans that they were going to charge them more for their pharmaceutical benefits, I think the veterans would have given them a resounding no. I think if they had told the veterans that they were going to axe the dental program which the veterans need, they would have said no. If they had told the veterans that they were going to increase the cost to them or their spouse of the home and community care program facilities like meals on wheels and home maintenance, veterans most certainly would have said no to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the minister's remarks here are rather hollow. The phoney propositions that the minister is putting forward with this piece of legislation are most unkind. There are some small things in this piece of legislation which are commendable. The increase in the value of the Victoria Cross allowance for the Australian recipients to $2,700, to bring it into line with allowances paid to British recipients, is reasonable; it is a good idea. A few people will profit and a large number of others will not. I think that is unfair.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7841">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is concerned that the government will do nothing about deeming rates. A lot of veterans are trying to exist on their savings. The government has had two interest rate cuts in recent months which helped people who are trying to buy houses, but veterans who have been fortunate enough to own their house&mdash;even though they might have to sell them now to get into a nursing home&mdash;are existing on a small amount of money. The government will not reduce the deeming rate and, therefore, they are disadvantaged as against others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some entitlements for veterans put forward in this legislation will be of small value to a small number of veterans, they are far outweighed by the policies that the government has implemented in the general aged care area. These policies will militate against veterans more than the rest of the community because the unfortunate fact of life is that, because of the difficult times that veterans went through in the defence of our country, their health is not as good as that of the general community. They are being hit harder and harder by this coalition government's attempts to rack up charges in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the opposition does not oppose many of the proposals in this bill, my colleague the member for Cunningham will be putting forward some amendments. Our general opposition to the government's position on aged care is based on how its draconian cuts to aged care facilities will hurt the veterans community more than anyone else.</PARA></SPEECH>

The government had to react to the debt that had been building up over a period of time&mdash;a legacy of the Labor government. Obviously, that affects the policies of the government. The people of Australia realised that they could not continue to go down this track, and that is why the Labor Party was so comprehensively defeated in the election in March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott). The government made some promises to the veterans community about helping them in the areas in which they were disadvantaged. There is no doubt that this is an attempt to overcome the problems associated with the benefits that are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7842"> given to this particular group in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previous speakers talked about the Australia Remembers program last year. That was a great program and I congratulate the former government for going ahead with it. There is no doubt that members of the community of my age or younger are not well aware of what went on in the wars&mdash;the Second World War in particular, and obviously they know very little about the First World War as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is important for younger members of the community to understand the service that was given by these people in the theatres of war. My father&hyphen;in&hyphen;law served on the Western Front in France in the First World War. He told me stories about the disease, the conditions and the suffering that those troops went through and I think not too many people realise what they went through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My state colleague, the member for Monaro, Peter Cochran, has visited New Guinea and he trekked across the Kokoda Trail. I have spoken to him and, if you listen to people who have been there and understand what the conditions were like, you soon realise that these troops went through tremendous hardships. We should always remember, in particular in relation to New Guinea, that some of the troops who were there were only 17 years of age, very young men, because most of our troops at that particular time were in the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We owe these people a very great debt and we need to do everything we possibly can to help them. I know that the minister has indicated that he is going to continue to amend the legislation to see that the promises that were made are carried through, and I hope that the parliament will be able to support him in that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think some of this is aimed at country veterans. We tend to forget that what is available in the city is often not available in the country and that it is a lot more difficult to provide those services in country areas. The minister is certainly attempting to overcome some of the disadvantages of veterans in country areas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose the north coast of New South Wales is not as isolated as some areas but there are a lot of veterans retiring to the north coast. I had a visit only recently from a representative of the veterans on the Clarence River, Mr Len Judd. He came down to Canberra and spoke with the minister and put some very constructive suggestions to him. Obviously, they were well thought through because they will provide a better service to the veterans and save taxpayer's money. It is very constructive when people can come and talk to the minister and put forward very useful suggestions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that transport in country areas is a problem. There is a problem for people driving to doctors and driving to hospitals because they have to travel hundreds of kilometres at times to get attention. They are areas that we have to watch very carefully to see that we do give a service to these people who are so very entitled to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the veterans are very grateful for the fact that the government is moving to help them in some way. One of the speakers before mentioned the fact that already they are taking advantage of the services that have been put forward in this amendment. I am sure that most people will be grateful for the fact that there is help available to them and the veterans that I have in my electorate have expressed that feeling to me.</PARA>

My elector <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7843"> ate of Robertson is based around the city of Gosford and encompasses the Woy Woy peninsula. It has one of the highest concentrations of veterans anywhere in Australia. In fact, according to official figures supplied by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, there are 9,260 people living on the Central Coast of New South Wales receiving a benefit of one kind or another from the Department of Veterans' Affairs and this figure includes approximately 2,000 war widows. The majority of these veterans live in my electorate of Robertson, the electorate which takes up the southern half of the Central Coast region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need to support veterans and their families has never been greater. The inevitable march of time has claimed all but a handful of our gallant World War I veterans. Recently, on Sunday, 24 November, there was the sad passing of Mr Harry Newhouse. The Central Coast then lost its last living link with the Gallipoli campaign and with our Anzacs. Mr Newhouse lived on the Central Coast for many years at the Woy Woy Community Nursing Home and had attained the grand old age of 101.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He, in fact, landed at Gallipoli on the second day of the campaign&mdash;on 26 April 1915. His brother, George, had landed the day previously&mdash;the first day of the campaign, obviously&mdash;and was unfortunately killed in action at Gallipoli. So well respected was Mr Newhouse that a memorial service was held on the Central Coast this week at which messages of condolence were read from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Harry's memories were recently preserved for all in the wonderful publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Last Anzacs</EMPHASIS>. Mr Newhouse returned to Gallipoli in 1990 to honour the 75th anniversary of Gallipoli and was among a number of Gallipoli veterans who made that trip to honour those who had fallen there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And whilst our gallant World War I veterans are very few, there are thousands of World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War veterans and their families who are in increasing need of assistance. The average age of World War II veterans is now in excess of 70 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years&mdash;proud men and women who gave their all for the defence of this country and made sacrifices that those of us from a younger generation cannot even begin to imagine. They are proud and independent men and women who do not easily ask for help or, indeed, do not expect help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the free and strong nation that we are, we owe these magnificent people a huge debt, a debt which we will never be able to fully repay. And we have a duty as a government and as a nation to ensure that these men and women enjoy their senior years with dignity, respect and honour, secure in the knowledge that the government will ensure that the services and benefits that they require, particularly as they age, are freely available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, during this debate, heard the minister and honourable members on both sides of the House recognise this debt of gratitude. My colleague Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert, highlighted the magnificent Australia Remembers initiatives which had the total support of the Australian parliament and, of course, the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must, however, state at this point my disappointment and my anger that, on taking over as the member for Robertson, the only paper&mdash;and I do mean the only paper&mdash;that was left in my office by my predecessor was over 3,000 Australia Remembers certificates which had not been issued to the veterans of Robertson. This, of course, meant that many eligible veterans and their families missed out on this magnificent memento of the Commonwealth's recognition of their service during the war years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7844"> Many veterans have endured severe injuries and disabilities brought about by the horrors of war. As time marches on the need for medical, physical and emotional support only becomes more urgent. I would like to take the opportunity at this stage to commend the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for his dedication to and compassion for the men and women that he represents. Under his guidance and the able assistance of his department, many areas of concern and individual prob lems of veterans on the Central Coast have been addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In just eight months of government, this minister has already visited the Central Coast of New South Wales on two occasions. The first was a visit to my electorate to present two very significant federal government grants to assist with the provision of housing and care for veterans. The first grant of over $281,000 was to the Woy Woy Community Nursing Home. This money will be used for the construction of a new hostel which will cater for an additional 40 people, with 15 places specifically for veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was on this occasion when the minister visited the Woy Woy Community Nursing Home that I had the privilege of introducing Mr Harry Newhouse to the minister and they chatted for some considerable time. On the same occasion, the minister also presented a grant of $339,500 to the Gosford RSL Leisure Living Centre. This money, again, will be used to upgrade facilities and to also provide a new dementia wing with the specific emphasis on care for veterans. These two grants are just another illustration of the commitment and dedication that this government has shown in providing the services and support that are required for veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet another indication of this commitment by our government was the announcement yesterday in this place by the minister of an additional $180,000 annually to ensure that veteran grave site memorials in civilian cemeteries are maintained to the high standard expected by the veteran community and the general public. The Office of Australian War Graves, which is responsible for the care of grave site memorials, already spends over $1,277,000 annually maintaining war graves in Australia and Papua New Guinea. This additional money will be used to carry out maintenance work on memorials in Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and Roma. Many of these grave sites have been maintained by families and by volunteers and it is now becoming increasingly difficult for the veterans, most of them now in their 80s, to continue to maintain some of these sites. It is obviously a government responsibility to ensure that these sites <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are maintained in the manner which the veterans and the community at large expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The veterans' affairs legislation amendment bill introduces the first instalment of the government's veterans' affairs budget commitment. The majority of the measures in this bill are designed to address various anomalies in veterans' entitlements and will fulfil a key undertaking in the coalition's policy statement on veterans' issues. In addition, other measures in the bill will greatly improve the administration of veterans' programs. This will enhance service deliveries to our veterans, simplify compliance and be less intrusive on the lives of our veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments relating to the extended deeming will simplify deeming regulations, freeing veterans from the need to advise the department of minor variations in interest received. Many veterans have reported to me that this requirement is overly intrusive. Not only will this amendment free veterans from this requirement but it is anticipated that banks and building societies will continue the practice of providing accounts offering an interest rate equal to the deeming rate. Presently the first $2,000 for singles and $4,000 for couples held as cash or deposit money is assessed at the actual interest rate payable if in fact that rate is less than five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This current exemption has added considerable complexity to the income assessment rules of financial assets. Each time a veteran's bank or financial institution's savings or investments underwent an interest rate fluctuation, no matter how minor, the veteran was required to advise the department. Many veterans, particularly those in their advanced years, have had difficulty in complying with this regulation and find it overly intrusive. Under these amendments this will no longer be necessary. The changes will give many pensioners the opportunity to increase their overall income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments relating to funeral benefit paid to the relatives of deceased veterans will bring equity and simplicity and will be less personally intrusive to the families of veterans who have passed on. The benefit will be in relation to the transportation charges of the deceased veteran who died in financial need and will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7845"> be paid from 20 August 1996. Applications for this benefit may be lodged up to 12 months after the veteran's death, so a benefit may be payable in respect of a veteran who passed on considerably before 20 August this year and will be of assistance to many veterans' families at a very difficult time in their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments relating to the abolition of the earnings credit scheme will simplify administration. The scheme is complex and difficult to administer and understand. It is being accessed by very few veterans. The earnings credit scheme was designed to provide an incentive for people to find work by allowing service pensioners and income support recipients to take up paid work and earn up to $1,050 without suffering immediate reduction. But, as I have mentioned, the scheme is being accessed by very few veterans and has high administration costs. This amendment brings the DVA scheme in line with the Department of Social Security earnings credit scheme, which is also to be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments to the defence service homes scheme will correct anomalies. Ex&hyphen;servicemen will now be entitled to a second initial loan on the basis of their status as a war widower. This entitlement is already available to World War II widows who are also ex&hyphen;servicewomen, and the reduction in the interest rate for new additional advances will be welcomed, I know, by defence service home loan recipients. The amendments mean that people will be able to use these advances for purposes such as home repairs or modifications without having to pay what is effectively a penalty interest rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments reduce the interest rate on new, additional advances provided to a person under the defence service home scheme from 10 per cent to 6.8 per cent per annum, or to an effective rate of not more than 6.85 per cent per annum in the majority of circumstances, depending on the type of previous advance that was provided to a person. The amendments mean that people who did not take out their full loan entitlements all at once will not have to pay what is, as I said before, effectively a penalty interest rate for the remainder of their loan.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, all additional advances are at 10 per cent. Obviously, the take&hyphen;up rate is expected to be small, because of the numbers who have not already taken out the full $25,000 entitlement. Most veterans are at an age where they are unwilling to incur further debt. In a full year, the take&hyphen;up rate will be approximately 500 applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the initiatives contained in the veterans' affairs legislation amendment bill are just part of the veterans' affairs budget package, which continues to demonstrate the strong commitment that this government has to veterans and to their families.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to address the House on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget Measures) Bill 1996. I rise today to acknowledge the active role of veterans in the community and, in particular, the wonderful contribution that they have made to Australia and in the Petrie electorate. The Petrie electorate in Brisbane has a very strong and an extremely visible veterans community from Deception Bay to Redcliffe and Bald Hills. The electorate includes memorials to veterans past, and dedicated buildings and halls, and the Remembrance Day ceremony last month was very well attended. The strong tradition continues and is now being passed on from generation to generation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make the point that veterans are very proud people who have given so much of themselves so unselfishly. And one of the features that I enjoy, whenever I attend veterans' functions, is that they are always willing to tell a story. The stories are often of days past and of people and events and other places, and they are often riddled with great humour and warmth, but deep down they are tinged with the scars of devastation and the destruction of war&mdash;a destruction, I hope, that many of us will never experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7846"> Many in the veterans community are active in the Petrie electorate, and organisations and associations such as the Redcliffe RSL, the Rats of Tobruk, the Vietnam Veterans' Association, War Widows and similar groups provide, indeed, very valuable support, friend ship and harmony. They have a very important role to play in our community. In fact, I believe that these organisations are vital to the local community for sustainability and growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without a doubt, more than ever before, there is a sincere recognition of the efforts of our veterans, and of the very special place that they so richly deserve in Australia's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) referred to the deeming rate affecting some 120,000 members of the veterans community. I have to assure them both that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) is taking account of these factors, including the reduction in official interest rates, at the moment. A review is being undertaken at the moment, and she is specially looking at that. This is one of the examples where we are willing to take a pro&hyphen;active role. One of the shining examples is that the recognition of veterans is as strong today as it was when the Anzac spirit was born.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9K6">Ms GAMBARO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure the member for Jagajaga would be interested to know that when veterans march for such wonderful occasions as Anzac Day the children line the streets and applaud. Every year those parades are getting stronger, and more and more attend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to also acknowledge the previous achievements of the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Con Sciacca, for his great work in this area, and I do acknowledge that he did a tremendous amount of work in this area. I do acknowledge him greatly for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the veterans community ages, it has become extremely necessary for the federal government to be prepared to have adequate facilities and services ready to provide for the increasing demands and needs of veterans in areas such as health, housing and care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the year 2000, it is expected that approximately 60 per cent of the Australian veteran community will be over the age of 75 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years. These areas of planning and preparation actively need to be pursued to ensure that the platform is prepared for the care of our veteran community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to acknowledge the fact that the needs of the veteran community cross over a number of portfolios, including the social security area, health and family services. There is a growing need in the community for simplification and for restructuring areas which are causing an incredible amount of unnecessary paperwork, administration, time and energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cares for the veteran community of today and believes that it is very important for it to be sensitive to their needs and especially to that growing area of their health needs. The federal government recognises the Anzac spirit which is so much a part of many Australian families, and has initiated a package of proposals which further recognises the veteran community and extends and acknowledges their contribution to Australian society. It is a package of initiatives which I support wholeheartedly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in the preparation of this bill and subsequent others that he will introduce as he puts forward this very important policy framework that the government has promised to the veterans community. The government is delivering on its commitments to veterans, and will address some very important issues to the veteran community, such as the areas which encompass health, housing, commemoration and compensation. The government, through its budget, has been able to keep its commitments and maintain security and provide strength with compassion and dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other major initiatives to be undertaken by the government include the following: the vocational rehabilitation program for younger veterans; assistance to ex&hyphen;service organisation practitioners; improvements to health outcomes; improvements in the entitlement for footwear and spectacles; and working to alleviate anomalies in relation to the provision of defence force homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of fundamental and important changes are dealt with in the veterans' affairs <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7847"> legislation presently before this House. A streamlined approach to veterans' affairs will mean much better service delivery, and that is really what it is all about. It will also have the added advantage of taking undue pressure off administration and providing a much more simplified approach than is currently available. In the area of income support, the initiatives introduced will bring far more flexibility and contentment. In some areas there has been rationalisation in the approach by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This much needed reform will be of interest to veterans in the Petrie electorate and will deliver a far more sensible and efficient approach to decision making and income support provisions. In fact, many of the points in this bill address the anomalies which previously existed and it will assure the veteran community that this government is fully supportive of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Particular issues which I have noted in the legislation, and which I would like to address today, include changes to the funeral benefits, amendments to lump sum advances and changes to areas which will alleviate administration. Firstly, I wish to highlight the point concerning funeral benefits. This legislation corrects some anomalies which previously existed in relation to the payment of transportation expenses and, indeed, is very welcome. A funeral benefit of $550 is automatically payable to the estate of certain deceased veterans, such as former prisoners of war. A benefit is also payable for charges in relation to the transportation of the body of the deceased veteran. Under the new legislation, amendments have been made to allow payment for the costs associated with the transport of remains of a veteran who dies when obtaining medical treatment away from home and the veteran is in financial need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further amendment which deserves reinforcing is that, in order to obtain a funeral benefit for transportation expenses, it is no longer necessary to provide information about the deceased veteran's financial circumstances. This will ensure that funeral benefits are less personally intrusive than they were before and this will certainly assist certain <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> veterans, as applications for this benefit may be lodged up to 12 months after the veteran's death. This will ensure that the benefit may be payable well before 20 August 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many in the veteran community who come to a period in their life when they may need a little extra money for the emergency replacement of goods or for a section of the family home which certainly needs maintaining. At the moment there are amendments in the legislation which will allow war widows to receive the maximum benefit of a $500 advance which previously may have been unavailable to them due to service pension or income support having a ceiling rate limiting the maximum amount of this particular advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation will also ensure that applicants for the lump sum advance will now not have to advise of the intention of the funds, and the amendments will slash administration costs by limiting pension advance payments to one per year. Another move to attack administrative burdens is the introduction of the minimum variation regime which will necessarily mean that pensioners will no longer be inconvenienced by having to inform the Department of Veterans' Affairs every single time there is a change to their income or assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the important areas in the bill is that this government further recognises the efforts of the repatriation claims scheme. A provision of further funding has been made available so that ex-service organisations can employ more staff. Not only will this initiative give the opportunity for further help and support, but it also will allow for positive job creation. Further training will also be provided to ex&hyphen;service organisations on issues such as veteran entitlements and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to reinforce that all of these measures being introduced by the federal government are indeed very positive measures. The importance of these initiatives is that they have been able to streamline the approach that the government has taken and the necessary administration of the veterans' portfolio, while ensuring that services and opportunities continue to be of a very high nature. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7848">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sacrifices of our veterans community should never be forgotten and this government has provided, and will continue to provide, a sustainable and very high quality of life that is indeed needed for veterans and their families. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Firstly, I want to thank members on both sides of the House for their contribution to this veterans' affairs bill. The interest we have seen from both sides of the House demonstrates the concern that we all have for our veteran community. I acknowledge the shadow minister's response to my second reading speech. I certainly noted his comments, mainly positive but some negative, and I want to comment on them. I also acknowledge the fact that he said I was not doing a bad job. We have got to find the odd positive. But I do want to thank the opposition spokesman because we have been in opposition and know how difficult it can be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to acknowledge his contribution, along with that of the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), although she started to stray from the text of the bill before the House as did many members on the other side of the House. I particularly want to comment on a couple of those areas. I did listen with interest to the contributions when I was in the House and when I had to leave for a while I was watching the debate with interest from my ministerial room.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this bill does is introduce a range of measures that were announced in the budget. The range of measures are particularly designed to ensure that we meet our commitments that we gave the veteran community before the election. We also address some longstanding anomalies and that is also significant. The initiatives we have introduced are really designed to not only improve the lot of our war widows and our veteran community in this nation but also ensure that we continue to acknowledge the great service that our veterans have given to this country. I know that I would not be in this House, nor would anyone be in this parliament today, if it were not for that commitment and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sacrifice which was made by so many hundreds of thousands of Australians. They continue to make that sacrifice because families still suffer from the loss of a loved one and from the trauma that many people still deal with on a day to day basis because of the horrors of war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was concerned about one aspect of this debate. In this country we have nearly always had a bipartisan approach to veterans' affairs. For years and years, both sides of the parliament have worked long and hard to ensure that the nation provides the best possible care, the best possible support, for our veterans and war widows. For many years, the commitment on all sides of parliament has been to achieve a little more than we have been able to afford as a nation in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was, therefore, concerned at some of the language that was used, such as that we were `a ruthless regime' and that we were introducing `wicked' legislation. I found that a little disturbing. Debates in parliament are broadcast live across the country. We have had several phone calls to my office today&mdash;and, I dare say, to departmental offices around Australia&mdash;from war widows who get concerned when they hear this being said right across the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they are talking about the veteran community, I urge members to use more appropriate language. Members of the veterans community get concerned. It is one of the most vulnerable sections of our community. We have had calls to my office. One particular person would not leave her name, but I wanted to ring her back. It is disturbing that people ring up because they are concerned about what they have heard in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see the speedy passage of this bill. It contains a range of measures which are particularly designed to assist our war widows, our veteran community and people in rural and remote Australia. They are also designed to acknowledge the great contribution of our Victoria Cross holders and to bring the commitment from this government in line with what is being paid by the British government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7849">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we can get this bill through this House, through the upper house and get royal assent before Christmas, it will, I hope, be possible to ensure that our Victoria Cross recipients receive the additional benefit before Christmas. It is particularly important that the bill gets speedy passage because of all the other measures it includes as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention the Victoria Cross recipients because the citation that is attached to the three surviving Victoria Cross recipients who are still with us in Australia today is retrospective to August 1995. That is one of the nice retrospective elements that we have introduced. It means that there will be a quite significant lump sum for those three Victoria Cross recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch on a couple of the issues that were raised by the opposition in relation to the deeming rate. The opposition pointed out that 120,000 veterans would be affected by this measure. They said that veterans deserve better and that their income could reduce by up to $100 per annum. I want to correct the misunderstanding of the effect of these provisions on our veteran community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, pensioners will not be affected by this measure if their sole source of income is from small amounts of financial assets&mdash;about $44,000 for single pensioners and $78,000 for couples. The opposition suggested that an estimated 120,000 veterans could be affected. Actually, an estimated 120,000 accounts&mdash;not veterans&mdash;could be affected. The deeming changes will affect about 100,000 pensioners. On average, the loss will be less than $1 per fortnight. Those whose pension will be reduced will have a reduction of between 10c and $1.90 per fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The member for Jagajaga also raised a point in relation to those who hold deeming accounts worth $2,000 or $4,000, depending on whether they are single or a couple. She said that many of these small amounts are kept in savings accounts which attract an interest rate of about one per cent. As the opposition would know, banks have established deeming accounts. What we are doing&mdash;and what opposition members were doing when they were in government&mdash;is encouraging pension ers to put their money into higher interest bearing accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to advise the House that deeming accounts for small amounts are available with banks and they are called special deeming accounts. They can receive five per cent for small deposits and up to seven per cent for large deposits. What we are talking about is encouraging the veteran community, and our pensioners too for that matter, to put their money into these deeming accounts because they will earn more money and they will be better off if they do so. This is far from being a draconian measure; it is something that we want to encourage. I would ask those on the other side of the House to encourage our veterans community to take up these deeming accounts because they do lead, at the end of the day, to a higher income for these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition said that earnings credit gives less incentive to earn additional income to supplement a pension. The incentive is already built into the system today. All pensioners have an income&hyphen;free area. It is $98 per fortnight for a single person and $172 per fortnight for a couple. Therefore, the abolition of the earnings credit is not a disincentive; the incentive is already built into the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition said also that this measure that we are introducing will lead to an increased reluctance to disclose income. To suggest that the veterans community, including our war widows, would knowingly go out there and defraud the Commonwealth simply amazes me. I have to say I reject that suggestion by the opposition. It is that sort of language that really does disturb me because, as I said earlier, this broadcast and all the contributions that have been made here today are being heard right across this nation on the parliamentary broadcast network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interests of time I will sum up reasonably quickly. All of us know that question time is coming on and we all want to see this bill pass through both houses as quickly as possible. I listened with interest to the issues raised by the member for Jagajaga in relation to Heidelberg and Austin hospitals. I must advise her that I have written to the Minister for Health in Victoria. It concerns <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7850"> me to hear that veterans may lie on a table or a trolley for 15 hours, but I urge the member in future to raise the issue directly with me and not wait until there is an appropriate debate in the parliament to raise it. The interests of the veterans must always be of paramount importance to this nation, to this parliament, on both sides of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the member for Jagajaga in future to come and see me about such issues as soon as she hears of them. However, I can tell her that I have already written to the Minister for Health in Victoria and am awaiting his reply. I acknowledge that perhaps there are some problems there at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I thank the staff of the Department of Veterans' Affairs both here in the national office and also right across the nation because they do untiring work to assist our veterans and our war widows. They do an absolutely fantastic job. I want to thank my adviser, Gary Kent, and the staff from the national office who are in the advisers box at the moment. A lot of work went on not only prior to the budget but also in drafting the legislation and ensuring that it conforms with all the rules and regulations. Of course, the department will have to be implementing this and ensuring that we deliver it to the community that we serve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank members on both sides of the House for their great contributions. I just urge that in future a much more restrained use of language be employed, bearing in mind the concern that this sort of language could have on our veterans community.</PARA>

<PARA>Very briefly, I thank the minister for the way in which he has responded to the concerns that were raised in this debate by members of the opposition. The amendments which I have moved, Nos 1 and 2, refer to the earnings credit scheme which is part of this bill, Nos 3, 4, 5 and 6 to the lump sum compensation, and No. 7 to extended deeming. I commented in my second reading speech on why we were moving these amendments and I did ask the minister to take them into consideration perhaps between now and when the Senate is going to consider this legislation. He has already given an indication that he will do so and have a look at whether or not there needs to be some changes, but I certainly gather from some of the comments that he has made that that may not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have brought these amendments forward because we are trying to assist the government in making this a fairer system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill 1996 has two principal purposes. The first is to facilitate cooperation between Australia and other nations to pursue the proceeds of criminal activity. It does so by allowing Australia to pay out of the proceeds of crime to foreign nations that have assisted us in the seizure of those proceeds. Further, the bill also allows Australia to receive the proceeds of crime paid to this country by other nations which Australian authorities have assisted to seize proceeds offshore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of this bill is entirely laudable and I wish to express the opposition's unequivocal support for these measures. Increasingly, organised crime&mdash;desperate to evade scrutiny&mdash;moves the proceeds of its activities through the world's international monetary system. Money laundering, particularly of moneys obtained through the drug trade, can be sent around the world in the blink of an eye through any one of a number of tax havens or sham transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pursuing these assets can take considerable time and resources but at the end of the day criminals want to enjoy the spoils of their wrongdoing and sooner or later their ill-gotten gains wind up in countries where they can be seized and seized they must be. Just as the means of the international criminal has become more complex so too have the investigative techniques available to law enforcement agencies. Just as it is imperative for international law enforcement agencies to cooperate to arrest criminals themselves, so too it is imperative that the proceeds of their crimes be seized. Any assistance that we can provide to both the Australian and overseas authorities to seize assets laundered through <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the international monetary system will clearly help in the greater struggle against these malefactors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his recent historic speech to the joint sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate, President Clinton identified the fight against international drug trafficking and organised crime as part of the next great challenge facing all nations. President Clinton said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we deal with these challenges to our security we must recognise the new ones which are emerging and the new approaches they require. Terrorism, international crime and drug trafficking are forces of destruction that have no tolerance for national borders. Together we must show zero tolerance for them. . . . It means, in short, pursuing a concerted strategy&mdash;intelligence and police cooperation world wide, coordinated action in every country to stop money laundering, shutting down grey markets for guns and false documents and increasing extraditions. It means security coordination . . . and giving in each of our nations our law enforcement officials the tools they need to cooperate and succeed.</PARA>
<PARA>Such cooperation is essential and I think the government needs to be applauded for introducing this aspect of the bill before us. We will give credit where credit is due and in this instance it is due. It is a situation that has cross&hyphen;party support and it should have cross&hyphen;party support. Too often the public only sees the differences between the parties; they do not see the cooperation between political parties. This is one bill where there is cooperation between both sides of the House. It provides a material way that all parties in this parliament can reaffirm their commitment to this most important struggle. But the commitment to the war against drugs and organised crime must be about more than just words. As the President said, we must give our law enforcement officials the tools they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore with great disappointment that I turn to the second aspect of the bill. I will be moving amendments during consideration in detail. I note the time and think it appropriate that I defer to question time at this stage. I seek leave to continue my comments at a later stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the member for Hotham addressed a number of questions to me relating to the taking of points of order and Speaker's rulings. I have reflected on the points made by the honourable member, as I undertook to do. The end result of my reflection is that there is in fact no simple formula that may be applied to situations requiring interpretation of standing orders. Much depends on the context in which various points of order may be raised. On some occasions it may be appropriate for a response to be made immediately and for that response to be in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> form of a ruling. On other occasions this may not be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just because a member prefaces a query or comment with the term `point of order', or even if a member explicitly requests a ruling, does not mean that the chair's response is a ruling. An example of the context in which the response of the chair may not involve a ruling would arise under the application of the concluding segment of standing order 86, which provides that a number of procedural motions may not be received again after being negatived if the Speaker or the chair is of the opinion that an abuse of the forms of the House or obstruction is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Standing order 107 clearly provides for the Speaker to apply an opinion as to which matter of public importance is the most urgent or important where two matters are lodged for discussion on the same day. Consequently, a ruling, an opinion or advice may be involved, depending on the particular matter and the circumstances in which it is raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also refer to the manner in which this matter was raised yesterday. I do not believe that it is appropriate for a series of fragmented questions to be addressed to the Speaker, each addressed following the chair's response, similar to the way in which one might see questions addressed to a witness in a courtroom proceeding. And I now know how they feel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In future, if a member has a series of related questions to be addressed to me, I would prefer them to be delivered in the one question in the normal course of events, similar to the way in which members phrase questions on notice. In fact, it would be helpful in many cases if members were to raise matters with me in writing.</PARA></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You talk about community rating, yet your own changes in 1995 allowed funds to undermine community rating by tendering for the work of employed persons who, by definition, are younger and fitter and offering 30 to 40 per cent discounts. So what are you on about? It is extreme hypocrisy to allow a drop&hyphen;out of private health insurance from 70 per cent to 33 per cent, to allow the proportion of over-65s to go up which deliberately destroys community rating and then to come and whinge and bleat about community rating. That is utter and extreme hypocrisy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the point you specifically raise, it is a submission to the Productivity Commission and I will wait to see what the Productivity Commission finally delivers in February.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to protect community rating, you have to be clear about what community rating is. Community rating means that people are not disadvantaged because of illness or age.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. It refers to the government's growth forecast for this year. Will the Treasurer confirm that private consumption is an even more important contributor than business investment to that forecast? Given yesterday's national accounts showing almost no consumption growth and a large accumulation of retail stocks and given Monday's trend retail sales figures showing falls for an utterly unprecedented three months in a row, will the Treasurer now acknowledge there is a significant risk that his budget growth forecast will not be met, with all that means for further unemployment growth?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we do approach Christmas, which is a time when most Australians and their families will be able to celebrate in comfort, celebrate in relative affluence and celebrate in a happy set of circumstances, there will be a section of the Australian population who, through no fault of their own, will not be able to celebrate Christmas in such a happy fashion. I hope that all Australians who are in more fortunate circumstances will dig very deeply into their pockets and give generously to organisations such as the Salvation Army, the Society of St Vincent de Paul and the many other great organisations which are associated with charitable efforts at Christmas time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the opportunity this morning of launching the national Christmas appeal for the Salvation Army. I made the point that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7857"> Australians traditionally, when properly approached and properly apprised of the circumstances, were willing to give very generously for those people in very necessitous circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that all Australians understand that there is a section of our population who will celebrate Christmas in less happy circumstances than we will and through no fault of their own&mdash;through not having a job, through a death in the family, through misadventure of some other kind&mdash;they will not be able to celebrate Christmas in such a happy set of circumstances. I would have thought that concern for that section of the population is something that unites all Australians across the political divide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the August budget the government increased funding for emergency relief by over $5 million a year for the next four financial years. We have also committed ourselves to reviewing the funding formula for that emergency relief program to make it more relevant to local needs throughout Australia and to give groups like the Salvation Army, the Smith Family and the Society of St Vincent de Paul much greater certainty in funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, those organisations depend very heavily on the generosity of Australians in all walks of life. I take this opportunity of appealing to Australians this Christmas to give very generously to those organisations so that our less fortunate fellow citizens may be able to enjoy something approaching the Christmas that most of us are privileged to look forward to enjoying in a few weeks time.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Minister, is it not a fact that your proposed $8 wage increase will be available to only 18 per cent of the work force? Is it not also a fact that, during 1995, 29 per cent of the work force were eligible for safety net wage increases because they gained no increase under enterprise bargaining?

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Corio. I am sure the Minister for Industrial Relations was not ignoring his responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly was not, Mr Speaker. So the shadow minister thought he was the government. He went down there with the ALP submission&mdash;a sort of new accord. This was the accord that they put up before the election. They lost the election, but do not worry about 2 March because we are going to go on with the accord regardless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incredibly, he asked me whether some of the figures that he has put in his question were right. Those are figures in our submission so, to the extent that you have simply repeated our submission, of course they are right. What is the point of those figures? The point of those figures is to show and to back up that our submission is based on the idea that the award system should be a safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is interesting in the shadow minister's question is that, by the way in which he has asked that question, he is walking away from a policy position which in government previously the Labor Party supported. I have a quote from the former Prime Minister in April <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7858"> 1993. When describing the nature of the award system as it ought to be in the future, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals. It is a model under which compulsorily arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net.</PARA>
<PARA>So, if you are asking me will it be the case that in the future the vast majority of people will receive their wage increases through agreements, the answer is yes. That was your policy. That is our policy today. That is the policy that we put to the commission, and that is the policy which by your question today you repudiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The incredible irony of the shadow minister fronting before the Industrial Relations Commission was brought home to me recently when in my bedtime reading I had a copy of a book by John Edwards, who was recounting the development of wages policy before the 1993 election. The question of the role of the commission came up in discussions between Mr Kelty and Mr Keating. From the chapter `The unwinnable election', someone asked what would happen if the commission refused to agree. Mr Kelty said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IRC will have to do it because if they don't they have no other role. They'll have nothing to do. If they knock it back, we abolish the&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K6">Mr BROUGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs and the minister responsible for customs. Given that the Australian Customs Service is the barrier which prevents drugs from coming into this country, can the minister inform the House what impact the service is having in this crucial role?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="7858" SPEAKER="Prosser, Geoff, MP" NAMEID="RI4" ELECTORATE="Forrest" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Small Business and Consumer Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RI4">Mr PROSSER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Longman for his question. One of the functions of the Customs Service is to police the border to prevent drugs from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coming into the country. I am pleased to inform the House of a significant drug seizure in Sydney, with the discovery of just on five tonnes of compressed cannabis valued at in excess of $50 million in cargo imported from Cambodia. This is the largest consignment of illicit drugs ever to be found in cargo in Australia. It is the result of some excellent work by Customs and by a number of Customs officers, including the Customs drug&hyphen;dog detector unit. The interception was the result of new technology and working smarter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seizure involved was contained in 258 bags of compressed cannabis in a 40&hyphen;foot container of raw jute. There was a false wall in the container and, on unpacking that container, Customs found and removed the false wall to find the compressed cannabis. It was in that way the seizure was brought about. The circumstances of the interception involved the use of a computer system to profile and target the consignment, as well as the involvement, as I have mentioned, of the drug&hyphen;dog detector unit, and confirmed suspicions of Customs in this area. The find illustrates the advantage of applying risk management rather than blanket approaches to the role of Customs at the border.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The find and exclusion of such a significant quantity of drugs from circulation in Australia are of benefit to the entire community and a major setback to those who would peddle those sorts of drugs in our community. To date this year, this brings the amount of seizure by Customs&mdash;coming in on passengers as well as by post&mdash;of cocaine to a total of 92 kilograms; heroin to 60 kilograms; ecstasy to in excess of 30 kilograms, or 30,000 tablets; and cannabis to now in excess of 900 seizures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a significant find. It is an indication to the Australian community that Customs, in working smarter and with new technology, are able to apprehend and seize at the border these sorts of illegal and illicit drugs.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is it not a fact that the government's submission to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7859"> would mean that most, if not all, workers on paid rates awards, such as public servants, nurses and teachers, amongst others, would receive no increase in their take&hyphen;home pay as a result of safety net increases for the next three years?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member would care to read the submission carefully, basically we are saying that the system should provide for an award safety net and that that award safety net should be updated by the Industrial Relations Commission. To answer your question specifically, as appropriate, that should include paid rates awards provided, however, that obviously the commission would also want to apply a principle of full absorption across the system.

The truth of the matter is that it will be a merry Christmas for a lot of Australians because not only have we now put in place the structural changes which you need to comprehend, if you want a full understanding of what I am saying to you about the nature of the system in future, but the other good thing for those thinking about Christmas and beyond is that, once you get beyond Christmas and into the new year and the commission brings down its decision, you will be facing, firstly, on 1 January, a tremendous benefit in your pay packet as a result of the family tax initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I can tell the honourable member that I am not just going to answer this question for you; I am also going to answer the question for a lot of people in my electorate. We are going to be putting around in my electorate, as I am sure will be put in literally hundreds and thousands of post office boxes around the country, a very simple pamphlet. It has a Christmas present on the front and it says, `Good news for 1997&mdash;our promise delivered'. Our promise for the average family, according to this pamphlet, is $34 a fortnight. So it is a pretty good deal. As far as the low paid are concerned, we are sup porting a very fair figure for those people in terms of an increase in the safety net; our submission is $8.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the Labor Party is complaining about it, but their figure for the last three years was $8. Of course, they did not have the benefits of the outcomes from better economic management that we are delivering, which are low inflation, tax cuts, assistance with private health insurance and, on top of all those goodies, about $145 a month for a family with an average mortgage&mdash;a great start to 1997 for average workers and for the community as a whole.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It did go through the upper house with some amendments, and those amendments will need to be accepted in the lower house. It is an historic occasion to see the successful passage of that legislation. The constitutional position is that, with the acceptance of that legislation, the Commonwealth needs to adopt accepting legislation. We are in the process of doing that and introducing that legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intention is that there will be&mdash;and arrangements are being put in place for this&mdash;a Senate committee process to allow a brief examination of that next week, possibly on Monday night, with a report back during the week. This is so that the Senate can complete its deliberations on the legislation, the legislation can come back into the lower house and we can then complete the passage of that legislation before the House rises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of all that is that we can have the referral and acceptance of the Victorian industrial relations power to the Commonwealth completed and in operation as at the commencement of the other processes of the workplace relations bill. So, from the point of view of employers and employees in Victoria, there will be no confusion with the start up of the two systems. The whole thing will, in effect, start as at 1 January. That is convenient for all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do appreciate that it will require both chambers to deal with the matter expeditiously, and I look forward to receiving support from the other side of the House to enable that to occur. I think the indications are reasonably positive in that regard. It will mean that, on top of the significant changes and reforms introduced by the workplace relations bill, we will have this crowning achievement in terms of the historic development of a single and simpler system for both employers and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finish by making the point that not only will no worker&mdash;particularly some hundreds of thousands of them in Victoria&mdash;be worse off but workers will be provided with many opportunities to be better off over time as a result of a much simpler and better system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to receive this question. Of course Dr Stocker, in his role as chief scientist, has an interest in maximising funding opportunities for R&amp;D, just as all of us on this side have. The so-called criticism the member refers to was contained in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  of Wednesday, 4 December. Let me quote exactly what Tim Colebatch, the economics editor, wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Dr Stocker warned that the recent flowering of R&amp;D activity in Australia was "a fragile flower" and should not be assumed to be permanent.</PARA>
<PARA>That is utterly unobjectionable. We all know, particularly after 13 years of Labor, that private sector investment in research and development has to be encouraged and expanded. That is utterly&mdash;utterly!&mdash;in accord with government policy. We do not complacently accept any aspect of economic policy, particularly that. What those opposite do not take into account but people like Dr John Stocker do is the initiatives we have launched in regard to research and development. The START program, which provides $520 million over four years, was especially drawn up to adapt to circumstances of particular companies, small and medium sized ones especially. So there might be loans, interest rate subsidies or grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that we have retained our general tax concession, unlike most other countries, at 125 per cent. We have expanded by two the cooperative research centres program, which is linking universities, research agencies and the private sector. We have increased university science and technology research funding by $130 million and have provided $90 million for research infrastructure, $30 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million to the ARC for the collaborative grants scheme and $9 million for postgraduate awards. We have maintained funding for the rural research and development corporations, which represents an increase in real terms of 5&half; per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, since it was elected on 2 March, has introduced the black spots program with $149 million worth of funding over the next four years. It is a very good program indeed and one which was in place during the term of the previous government but one which they axed&mdash;one of the saddest things for trying to improve road safety around Australia. It was a good program. For every $500,000 spent on the black spots program, evidence proved that it saved a life. This government is about improving road safety. That is why we have allocated $149 million over the next four years in this new, reintroduced black spots road funding program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the benefit of the honourable member for Swan, I am aware of this intersection. He has drawn it to my attention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a worthwhile point to make that the honourable member for Melbourne and the party that he represents have allowed these services to decline over the last few years very substantially indeed.

<TIME.STAMP>(3.19 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am tabling in parliament today the government's response to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS>  report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In opposition I had been very active in highlighting the need for the establishment of a parliamentary inquiry and became an enthusiastic member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure inquiry into aviation safety in the commuter and general aviation sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliamentary inquiry was established following the release in July 1994 of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation's report into the Monarch Airlines accident crash, which killed the two crew and five passengers on board on 11 June 1993. I took a close interest in that tragedy because all the passengers were known to me, and most of them were my constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry was advertised widely, resulting in over 250 submissions from interested parties and 22 public hearings conducted at several locations around the country at Moorabbin, Bankstown and Brisbane, as well as in Canberra. Before the plane safe inquiry was completed, the tragic Seaview accident took place, taking nine lives. The CAA was then split into the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, and Airservices Australia, under separate legislative charters, as I advocated in my first speech on this subject in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7869"> May 1994. It gave me no satisfaction that the Seaview accident had occurred, despite the warning signals that had been given by me and many others in the aviation industry months before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the plane safe committee understood that many people took the opportunity to make `complaints submissions', directed primarily at the regulator, it was surprised at the evidence that pointed to divisions within the industry, clashes of personalities and the readiness of some to vilify others in the industry. Too many people were chasing too little business. Pressures then mount to save dollars on safety related activities, such as maintenance, leading to violation of safety regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also uncovered wars going on inside and outside the CAA. We did not find a harmonious safety regulator, focused on teamwork, working to a common purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The relationship between the CAA and industry was no better. The regulatory framework was simply out of date, comprising hundreds of often unintelligible and inconsistent regulations&mdash;in some cases, simply unnecessary or counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian aviation industry has some of the most professional personnel in the world and they have helped maintain our international standing in aviation safety. But there was also a feeling in general aviation that the former CAA spent an inordinate amount of effort in the safety surveillance of private operations, seeking out relatively minor defects, compared with the effort put into monitoring the operations of airlines in carrying fare paying passengers, especially the operations of commuter and charter airlines, where little effort seemed to be taken. The CAA failed to view the bigger picture and appreciate that the regulator's primary role must be on ensuring the safety of fare paying passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I plan to give a further reference to the committee's successor&mdash;the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform&mdash;in the coming year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee focused on many critical and key areas in its conclusions and recommendations in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> report. I am pleased to announce today the government's response to each of these recommendations in the five key areas: improving safety, the effectiveness of regulation, organisational performance, knowledge of the industry and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deficiencies highlighted in the report have been corroborated by the Monarch coronial inquiry and the Seaview commission of inquiry report. The government's efforts to address these deficiencies began in my response to the Monarch coronial report on 25 June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 28 June I launched the most extensive review of Australia's aviation safety regulation regime in aviation history. This review process is an important step forward for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It is about simplicity and efficiency. It comprises two parts:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a regulatory framework program which will result in a total rewrite of the regulations; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a regulatory role program involving a thorough examination of the way the Civil Aviation Safety Authority carries out its regulatory responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An overarching program advisory panel is overseeing the review chaired by Mr James Kimpton of Ansett Australia, an immediate past chairman of the Australian Air Transport Association. An important member is John Laverick, the father of one of the victims of the Seaview crash, who has become an effective advocate for consumer rights in aviation. He is supported by Hilary Caldwell, wife of a victim of the Monarch crash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For too long the consumer has been forgotten in aviation regulation. Today I have taken steps towards addressing this oversight. In conjunction with the two major domestic Australian airlines and the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, I have signed a code of conduct in relation to domestic code share flights. This code provides that:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> tickets issued from Qantas and Ansett incorporate printed information advising a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7870"> code&hyphen;share service is being operated and giving the name of the carrier operating the service,</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> tickets issued by travel agents have a sticker advising the consumer if it is a code&hyphen;share flight and indicating they can seek further information from the ticketing airline, and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> code&hyphen;share flights be clearly indicated on airline timetables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is only a first step. A safety pamphlet providing a simple explanation of charter and regular public transport safety regulatory and operational standards so that consumers are aware of the standards relevant to the type of different operations available in Australia is being prepared. Further information for the public and the industry will be provided by the release today of a comprehensive series of aviation safety and activity indicators. This new publication will complement traditional presentations of accident statistics with indicators including flying hours, licences, occupations, airspace incursions and load factors, to be updated annually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my ministerial statement accompanying the tabling of the Seaview Commission of Inquiry on 8 October this year, I touched on the need for a change of culture inside the regulator. None of us on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> committee believed that this would be an easy task. CASA has been criticised as simply the regulatory arm of the old Civil Aviation Authority under a new name, and still suffering from many of its shortcomings. These criticisms must be addressed and implementation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> recommendations is a fundamental part of this process. The response to these recommendations provide CASA and the industry with an opportunity to repair Australia's aviation safety regulatory regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will place more onus on owners rather than their employees to ensure that airline operations are conducted in accordance with regulations. The government demands a significant improvement in aviation safety in this country, which will need commitment to move forward from all participants in the aviation industry, including all CASA staff and management.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this critical time for the authority, it needs strong leadership from a board with an understanding of the aviation industry and an intelligently informed appreciation of the reforms needed within CASA to address the difficulties of the past. I need board members with aviation experience to closely guide the rebuilding of Australia's aviation safety regulator and the other regulatory reforms currently under way. That is why I call on the board members to make way to enable the government to implement its election commitment in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I extend my thanks to my colleagues on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> committee: the chairman, the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), chaired the committee throughout its deliberations and did a very good job; the deputy chairman, the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur); another very active member of the committee, the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), who participated, I think, in every one of the hearings of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> inquiry; and to other members of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to thank those people who gave evidence to us. Even though at times the evidence given to us was frustrating and conflicted with previous evidence given, causing members of the committee taking an interest in this inquiry to take longer to deliberate over it than we otherwise would have done, I thank all the people who gave evidence. It was valuable evidence which will help build a safer aviation industry for Australia. I also thank the committee secretary, Mr Malcolm Aldons, and the secretariat staff. They successfully mastered one of the most daunting data management tasks ever to confront a parliamentary committee. I take this opportunity to thank our consultant, Mr Trevor Thomas, who was engaged by the committee specifically to assist in providing advice throughout the time of the inquiry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This is the third ministerial statement on aviation safety regulations we have had in roughly five months. Unfortunately, quantity <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7871"> is no substitute for quality. It has been roughly nine months since the government had its first opportunity to make a response to the findings of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS>  inquiry. If ministerial statements were the solution, then we would have had all the problems well behind us by now. It is also, I observe in passing, a great pity that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), who has been so productive when it comes to making ministerial statements on aviation safety, has failed to come into this House and make a ministerial statement on the proposed privatisation of Australian National and National Rail, which he saw fit to announce on the Channel 9 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS>  program rather than to the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition welcomes the acceptance by the government of the substantive recommendations in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> inquiry. I particularly refer to the proposed code of conduct on code sharing; the proposal to publish safety deficiency reports for individual operators, which will create greater information on which people can judge the safety performance of the various airlines offering passenger services; and the proposal to conduct a greater number of random and surprise checks on charter operators and also those people potentially involved in trading in bogus parts, which is becoming an increasing problem not only in Australia but also in other parts of the world. I would describe these as long overdue and important first steps. But they are by no means the conclusion to the problems that we face in aviation safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that the minister proposes to request the House committee to conduct another inquiry. It is not specified in his speech, but I presume that he refers to the sports aviation recommendation that was included in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> recommendations. As a member of that committee I certainly hope he does, because we have had enough inquiries, I think, on these issues to understand what the problems really are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fortunate that we are at last seeing the minister address some of the substantive issues in aviation safety regulation after the first two non&hyphen;event statements that he has made to the House in which there are only <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> two substantial messages: firstly, his unrelenting and personal vendetta against the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and, in particular, the chairman of the board, Mr Justice Fisher; and, secondly, his commendable proposal for a regulatory review with respect to our civil aviation safety regulations. With respect to the first, we have seen on numerous occasions completely unfounded attacks on the integrity, the performance and the competence of the members of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, in which he has demeaned his office of minister and has bemused people in the industry to the point where editors of distinguished specialist publications in the industry such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aviation Report</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Flying</EMPHASIS> have commented adversely on the minister's approach in this area. Many others have also commented on the peculiarity of his vendetta against the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulatory review, as I indicated, is a worthwhile proposal which merits action in its own right, but it is not the primary solution to the problems that we have had in civil aviation safety regulation because those problems are essentially problems of enforcement. They are not problems necessarily related to the content of the regulations, although there clearly is need for improvement there. The primary problems we face in aviation safety regulation, as was made very plain in the Monarch and Seaview reports, relate to the enforcement of the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in the question of establishing that regulatory review, the minister was unable to avoid some rather spectacular blunders reflecting his interests and his debts to particular sections of the industry. He asked the representatives of the various components of the industry represented on the program advisory panel for the regulatory review to nominate a person from amongst themselves to chair that panel. They came forward with a nomination. The minister decided that he did not like their nomination and, therefore, unilaterally decided that Mr Boyd Munro from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association would be appointed to chair the panel.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this unilateral announcement, the bulk of the members of the panel representing the bulk of the industry&mdash;the industry that carries 30 million passengers every year, the people who actually do the hard work and have the responsibility of ensuring that Australians can catch planes, helicopters and the like without fear for their safety&mdash;rebelled. They rejected the minister's nomination and said that, if that were the case, they would simply refuse to serve. The minister, therefore, had to ignominiously back down and we ended up with Mr James Kimpton&mdash;a very worthwhile appointment&mdash;to chair that board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his approach to these issues, the minister has constantly been attacking not only the board of CASA but also the staff and the management of CASA, virtually never actually providing detail of anything that they are alleged to have done, never providing evidence, never providing substance&mdash;just making sweeping statements and accusations indicating ongoing failings but with no action on his part to deal with these things other than his continuing vendetta against the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent examples of his behaviour with respect to the civil aviation safety regulation matters include overruling his own experts in CASA on the electronic locater transmitters issue, which I have mentioned previously in the House. And it was recently admitted in the Senate estimates process by the CEO of CASA, Mr Leroy Keith, that, as a result of the decision that was forced on CASA by the minister against their expert advice to allow hand&hyphen;held ELTs to be used in lieu of fixed ELTs, this would mean that a `lesser standard' would apply. In Mr Keith's words, the reason for this was that:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Would you like those words as well:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">were opposed to a relatively expensive beacon.</PARA>
<PARA>I am happy to table the full quote. What Mr Keith was admitting was that CASA had advised against a regulation allowing hand&hyphen;held ELTs and been overruled by the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister. There is a minute on the record of 16 May from the chief flying operations manager of the technical branch of CASA, Mr Holger von Munchausen, disassociating himself and the other technical advisers in that branch of CASA from the minister's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second recent performance in this area that has merited some attention has related to the Falcon Airlines crash where the minister has given two answers in the House on two issues that he has sought to connect: the crash itself, which, fortunately, led to no loss of life; and the fact that a CASA inspector in North Queensland was a former owner of Falcon Airlines and that potentially there was a conflict of interest there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a critical issue in all of this, one key fact, and the minister did not mention it on either occasion&mdash;another slippery little performance. He did not mention the key fact that Mr Kilin, the former owner of Falcon Airlines, was employed by CASA explicitly on the basis that he would not be engaged in any supervisory activities with respect to Falcon Airlines. But did the minister mention that in either of his statements in the House in response to questions? No. Has he mentioned it in public in any situation at all? No. Has he mentioned it at all? No, he has not mentioned it in the slightest. There may well be issues of conflict of interest involved in some situations in CASA, but one of the reasons that they tend to arise is that CASA has a very small pool of people to draw from. By definition, in order to get people to engage in aviation regulatory activity, they are going to have to go primarily to people who are in the aviation industry, the very people who are being regulated. It is difficult to avoid. It is an important issue and something that any government has to pay serious attention to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been significant improvements in recent times, which I applaud&mdash;initiated by Leroy Keith&mdash;but the minister, in his unrelenting attempts to blacken the name of CASA and its board, has failed to point out that this safeguard was built in there. It is the key fact in this story. We have seen a similar performance with respect to the recent resignation of Dr Robert Liddell, the former chief <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7873"> medical officer of CASA, who made a number of allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister and his office have concluded that, in this situation, CASA was right. It appears Dr Liddell resigned because he was unhappy that his budget for overseas travel had been cut and CASA was refusing to pay the cost of his being trained to fly 767s. CASA determined that this was an excessive amount of money to be provided for unilaterally discretionary expenditure, and Dr Liddell was unhappy about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CASA pointed out that the cuts that had been made in Dr Liddell's discretionary budget had been made across the organisation in discretionary budgets because the minister had asked CASA to conduct the regulatory review. That had not been given additional funding and, therefore, these cuts had to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have we heard the minister at any stage publicly state that CASA was in the right in these situations, that there was nothing wrong in the circumstances that led to Dr Liddell's resigning? No, we have not. The minister has deliberately, duplicitously and highly irresponsibly continued to attack his own authority, an authority that has a fundamental and very important responsibility&mdash;to ensure the safety of people in the aviation sector, passengers in planes and other aviation craft throughout this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about the likely consequences of these unrelenting attacks. I am concerned about the possible future of the CEO of CASA, Mr Leroy Keith, who is facing a very difficult task and is constantly being effectively undermined by the minister's interference and by his attacks on CASA. I would be not at all surprised if at some stage Mr Keith decides that he has had enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have confidence in Mr Keith. I would like to hear the minister stand up and say that he has confidence in Mr Keith. To the best of my knowledge, there has not been one divided vote on that board, Minister. The board that you attack, the board that you criticise, has not had any serious divisions. That includes Mr Keith. I would like to hear you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stand up and express your confidence in Mr Keith. I have confidence in him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of constantly sniping, criticising, publicly attacking and running a vendetta against your own authority, I would like to see you get in there, roll your sleeves up, get your hands a bit dirty and start working with them to deal with some of the critical issues, instead of just throwing mud at them. At least we made a start today by responding to some of the important recommendations in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> report. That is an important start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, it is critical that you realise, as Mr Justice Fisher pointed out, that CASA is not there to serve the industry. The industry is not CASA's customer. CASA is there to regulate the industry. It regulates the industry on behalf of 30 million passengers, who have safety concerns. Minister, you are responsible for them and you have to look after them. CASA regulates the industry on the passengers' behalf. It is not there to serve the industry; it is there to regulate the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appeal to those mainstream, large players in the industry&mdash;to the Qantases and the Ansetts and the regional carriers&mdash;who have been quiet in the debate so far and who ultimately must represent the interests of those passengers, the people who provide their business, to come out and give their views on the outrageous stuff that has been going on from this minister with respect to civil aviation safety regulation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am tabling today for the information of honourable members the first ever local government national report and accompanying policy paper outlining the Commonwealth policy on local government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7874"> Under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995, the federal minister responsible for local government is required to report annually to parliament on the operation of the act. This report is an important document aimed at improving the accountability of councils, encouraging council effi ciency and effectiveness. It also makes the process of distributing Commonwealth grants to councils transparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Together with this first national report, I am tabling a policy paper on local government, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth councils and community&mdash;looking ahead</EMPHASIS>, which challenges local government to take advantage of Commonwealth support and work together to advance good governance, good economic management and greater fairness in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would all agree that local government plays a key role in the wellbeing of every Australian. From Huon Valley to Minjilang, from Busselton to Cardwell, across Australia some 770 local councils provide leadership and services to their local communities. In total, local government expenditure exceeds $11 billion, or some five per cent of total government spending, and in 1995-96 local councils employed some 155,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The services of local government are vital to businesses as well as to individuals. Local public works, recreation, public health, community services, building, planning and development approval and cultural activities are just a few examples of services for which we rely on local councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the diversity in councils, the central challenge for each is to provide the highest quality and widest range of services, consistent with the needs and aspirations of its community and the resources available. This must be achieved within the provisions of relevant state and territory legislation and regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australia is to develop and prosper, all three spheres of government&mdash;Commonwealth, state and territory and local&mdash;must play their part in establishing a framework of governance which allows individuals, families, business and communities to realise their potential and flourish. To meet this challenge councils must seek continuous improvement in all council activities, identify and introduce new technologies or processes which can achieve quantum improvement in councils' operations or service delivery, provide leadership in balancing the demands of the vocal against the views of the wider community, and seek to broaden and deepen the council <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> financial base to provide greater financial capacity and stability. Many councils are taking up this challenge and this needs to be an ongoing process, as it is for other  governments and the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While local government governance is primarily an issue for state and territory governments and local councils themselves, the Commonwealth wishes to ensure that financial assistance to local government contributes to optimal community outcomes. Most local councils derive the largest share of their revenue from property rates. Other sources of income generated by councils include charges for garbage collection, public services, housing and community services, economic services, health and community services, recreational and cultural amenities and charges associated with development activities. Total income from these sources, however, is generally not sufficient to fully finance councils' operations and provide an appropriate level of services to residents. Councils with small populations and a limited revenue base are often among the most stretched.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth provides significant financial assistance and program funding to local government. As a matter of good management, however, local councils should seek as far as possible to achieve financial security in their own right. This requires them to consolidate their revenue bases, explore alternative financing mechanisms and ensure that their administration and services are as affordable and efficient as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996&hyphen;97 the Commonwealth is contributing over $1.2 billion to increase the financial capacity of local councils and provide greater certainty in their funding. This represents an increase of four per cent over Commonwealth funding to local government in 1995&hyphen;96, an excellent result for local government in the light of the very difficult economic circumstances faced by the government when it came to office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding provided by the Commonwealth through financial assistance grants, known as FAGs, is a significant element in the budgets of individual local councils, ranging up to around half of their income in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7875"> some cases, especially in remote areas. The overall contribution by FAGs to local government income is over 10 per cent. In keeping with the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act the government will initiate a review of local government financial assistance, to be carried out not later than 30 June 2001. This will be done in consultation with the states and territories and local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important purpose of the report being tabled today is to improve the transparency with which states and the Northern Territory Grants Commission determine the distribution of financial assistance to councils within their jurisdictions. The information provided through this annual report will be valuable background for this planned review of FAGs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The documents being tabled today review the existing position of councils but, importantly, also look to the future. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth, councils and community&mdash;looking ahead</EMPHASIS> sets out a range of new initiatives. These are summarised in the policy paper but the main elements include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">training for council officers to enhance their skills to meet emerging policy and management challenges;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">continuing support for the National Awards for Innovation in Local Government, NAILG, to promote excellence and innovation in local government activities and services. For the 1997 awards there is a reduced number of categories to encourage even higher quality applications and proposals;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">the government's response to the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force that relate to local government. In consultation with the states, territories and local government, I intend to provide support for the implementation of local government related recommendations;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">cooperation with councils affected by the Sydney 2000 Games to facilitate their making the best possible use of opportunities provided by this unique event in conjunction with my role as Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the 2000 Olympics; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">continued support for benchmarking and continuous improvement initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be making more detailed announcements on these and the other initiatives early in the new year after discussions, including with State and local governments. The initiatives outlined in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth, councils and community&mdash;looking ahead</EMPHASIS> provide a framework for addressing the challenges facing local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to commending the report, I also extend my thanks and the thanks of my office to the National Office of Local Government, who have worked tirelessly to prepare this documentation in a reasonably short period. It is the first time this report has been presented to the parliament. It is by virtue of an act that both sides of the parliament supported prior to the election and it is also equipped with detailed maps of all the local council districts, all 770 of them right around Australia. To colleagues of the National Office of Local Government, we extend a special thank you to you for the work you have done as well. I commend it and the national report to honourable members.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Among the documents that the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) is tabling today, there is one outstanding omission. The former Labor government had an accord with the local government sector&mdash;a very useful accord, an expression of partnership between federal and local governments in Australia consummated by the former minister Brian Howe. The coalition's version of that accord will not be found among the documents the minister is tabling today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has been trying to negotiate a memorandum of understanding with the Australian Local Government Association throughout the course of this week with its general assembly here in Canberra. The fact that that memorandum has not been signed off by both parties, I believe, is a fundamental breach of trust and process between the new federal government and the local government sector. I think it is very disappointing that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7876"> new minister and the new coalition government have been unable to continue that sense of partnership and formal agreement that the former government had in place with local government authorities throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I further understand that the main stumbling block in arriving at a memorandum of understanding is the position in relation to the future of financial assistance grants. As the shadow minister, I have no doubt that the concerns of local government are well placed&mdash;not only legitimate concerns but also legitimate confusion about what this government wants to do with the $1.2 billion financial assistance grants program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new minister, Mr Smith, started his time as minister addressing the IMM in Canberra talking about the importance of amalgamation of councils&mdash;something that needs to be linked in his opinion to the financial assistance grants.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="BROADBENT" NAMEID="MT4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MT4">Mr Broadbent</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hear, hear!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That, despite the support of the honourable member now interjecting, has fallen off the agenda. If Mr Broadbent is so supportive of linking financial assistance grants to amalgamations he will be very disappointed to see that among the documents being tabled by the minister today there is no such linkage. So the minister flew that proposition up the flagpole but it fell down just as quickly. The Australian Labor Party, in the broad sweep of reforms that might produce local government efficiencies, sees council amalgamations as a low order priority. We think more important issues should be raised with respect to financial assistance grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the National Commission of Audit which recommended the abolition of the direct payment of financial assistance grants to local government and that those payments should be incorporated into state government payments. The recommendations of the National Commission of Audit have not been refuted by the minister. I was expecting that in his ministerial statement today he might take the opportunity in this important week for local government to rule out of hand, to rule as unacceptable, any linkage, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any direct payment, of financial assistance grants on to states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party believes passionately that the system we put in place under Tom Uren should remain in place; that is, there should be a direct allocation to the councils themselves, not the rolling of financial assistance grants into general state payments. The confusion of local government is well recorded by those events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have the announcement today by the minister that he is conducting a review. Having tried two policy proposals and got nowhere, we are now getting a review to be completed by 1 July 2001. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, as a longstanding and long serving member of the House, you and many others would appreciate that this is perhaps a world record for time in which a review of a straightforward part of Commonwealth responsibilities is to be conducted&mdash;4&half; years of uncertainty for local government in the future direction of financial assistance grants. I can only suggest that the minister is either overworked or has to take these things step by step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a debate about whether or not the government is full of hares or tortoises. The minister has put himself in the tortoise camp. I can only suggest that he wants to get the Olympics out of the way in the year 2000 before he can finalise the FAG review. He has mentioned that it is in the act. If he seeks the cooperation of the opposition in amending the act for a more prompt review, then I can assure him that that cooperation would be forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is quite concerned about the direction of policy affecting the local government sector. There has been an exaggeration of the imbalance between municipal responsibilities and municipal finances since March. We have seen savage cuts to the child&hyphen;care sector. Child&hyphen;care centres have been forced to close under this government's policies, something that really affects local government hard and directly. The abolition of employment programs is driving down new work opportunities out of the local government sector. The cuts to the information technology initiative for libraries, cuts to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7877"> urban flood mitigation program, cuts to better cities mark II, cuts to road infrastructure&mdash;all of these cuts are impacting harshly upon municipal budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government might claim a four per cent gross increase in the FAGs allocation for 1996-97, everyone knows, including everyone at the general assembly this week, that that is merely the continuation of indexation introduced by the former government. When one accounts for inflation costs to councils, it reflects a real change close enough to zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, only action by the Premiers and the ALGA in May prevented councils from having to pay all federal sales taxes without a dollar of federal land rates in return. Each of the policies of the new government concerning local government underrates the role of councils as a service provider. During a time of economic and social change, communities need new sources of stability and opportunity. Particularly in our regions, local government should be seen and developed as an important stabiliser for society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If properly resourced and chartered, it can do the things and provide the opportunities which individuals, families and communities are now struggling to do and provide. Moreover, the Labor Party urges the minister to quickly finalise the issue of constitutional recognition for local government. What is happening with the constitutional convention? What has happened to the government's firm election promise to place the constitutional recognition of local government on the agenda of that constitutional convention? We all remember so sadly the shameful campaign led by the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and other members of the Liberal Party in 1988 to oppose the constitutional recognition of local government. Now in federal government the coalition should speedily support its commitment for the constitutional recognition of local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party believes passionately in the active role of government, especially at a local level. It might just be that amid the flurry of change in Australia and beyond the only true stabilisers most of us will find, the only lasting guarantees we will have against <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> insecurity, lie in the things we will share in common and are willing to share with each other. Local government at community level is a very important expression of that principle. It can do good things at a local level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Local government has always been supported by the Australian Labor Party: in our origins more than a century ago, in the pioneering reforms of Tom Uren, continued by Brian Howe. We note with grave concern and disappointment that many of those supportive functions and programs for local government are being wound back and wound down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We urge the government to place on the agenda of COAG an active review of the functions and financial opportunities available to local government in Australia, particularly to resurrect the place management trials that were going to feature as part of the better cities program mark II&mdash;that is, new systems of integrated service delivery to address the primary problems of disadvantage in our society at a local level. If being disadvantaged is a whole of life experience, local government can be used as a catalyst to develop whole of government solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, we urge so many colleagues and friends in the local government sector to join our campaign for public sector renewal to show that government in our society during this time of change has a very active creative role to play, especially at a local level. So I make those remarks with respect to the minister's statement and the omission in his tabling of a memorandum of understanding with local government. It is a sad moment that the partnership established by the former government is not to be continued at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I wish to place on record the appreciation of the Australian Labor Party for Mr David Plumridge, the outgoing President of the ALGA. We appreciate his efforts and service to the sector and his active cooperation with the former minister, Mr Brian Howe. We warmly welcome councillor John Campbell, Deputy Mayor of the City of Brisbane, as the new President of the ALGA. We look forward as ever to a very constructive relationship with the peak body of local <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7878"> government and each of the 700-odd councils throughout Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<TIME.STAMP>(3.57 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Mr Speaker, tomorrow I will hand you my resignation from this House. So I thank you and the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) for the courtesy of allowing me to make this final statement. It has been an extraordinary privilege to represent the people of Fraser in this House for the last 12 years, a privilege to which earlier in life I barely dared to aspire. There is no other electorate I would rather have represented, for the voters in Fraser are generally, socially and environmentally concerned, politically well informed, interested in public issues, supportive of humane, equitable policies and culturally diverse. This has made my work both interesting and demanding but has also meant there has been strong support for advocacy of policies aimed at goals in those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the launch of my first campaign for Fraser in 1984, I said that the principal factors which led me into politics have been concern about unemployment, about injustice both within Australia and between rich and poor countries, concern about international conflict, particularly about the arms race, and a fascination with attempts to ensure good government. These have been amongst the main issues on which I concentrated while a member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my maiden speech I discussed three issues: responsible government for Canberra, the growth of employment and the arms race. There has been striking progress on each of those issues since then. After much debate, the Commonwealth government's benevolent dictatorship of Canberra ended with the election of the ACT Legislative Assembly in 1989. The number of people in employment in Australia grew by over two million between 1983 and 1995, a fine national achievement to which the accord, moderately stimulatory macro&hyphen;economic policy and active employment programs all contributed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As one of the originators, with Ralph Willis, of the accord and as a constant advo cate of employment stimulating policies, I played a minor part in the development of policies which contributed to that growth. Yet for many reasons unemployment remains Australia's most pressing economic and social problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the third issue, the conclusion of the Cold War has transformed global security, and since 1987 there has been a striking decline in global military expenditure&mdash;by a third, in fact. In Australia, for example, the proportion of GDP spent on defence has fallen from 2.6 per cent in 1983-84 to two per cent last year, releasing billions of dollars for improvements in health, education and other desperately needed community services. In a situation where Australia has no enemies, there are no impending threats and most other countries are also reducing the proportion of their national income spent on defence, this reallocation of expenditure priorities is the only responsible policy&mdash;and I am particularly delighted that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is here to hear that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there has been striking progress in each of the areas I identified as my priorities when first elected, though I can claim no responsibility for some of them. Since being elected, I have also continued to constantly advocate strategies and policies which would contribute to increasing equity, strengthening community services, reducing injustice and poverty in Australia and overseas, and protecting ecological diversity. There have, of course, been many debates and conflicts about policies in those areas during the last dozen years. Every member has four loyalties: to their electorate, to the members of the party which preselects them, to their caucus colleagues and to their own values and principles. Each of those loyalties is of crucial importance, yet it is inevitable that they will frequently be in conflict. Each of us resolve those conflicts in different ways on different occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For me, there was a central issue of conflict&mdash;the dominance of market fundamentalism in economic departments of the Public Service and amongst many of the economic commentators, and the influence this has had on some of my colleagues. This narrow and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7879"> simplistic doctrine not only neglects the frequency of market failure but also misplaces priorities by obsessively emphasising economic criteria at the expense of human wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet we are a human society, and economic development is a means to an end&mdash;not an end in itself. So I have continued to argue for balancing economic criteria with broader human, social and ecological goals and for allowing politics to have its proper role, which is the articulation of the interests of all groups in the community, not just the financial markets, and the reconciling of those differing interests in the context of national and global goals and imperatives. The conflict this involved within the Labor Party prevented me from becoming a minister, which I greatly regret. But I am glad to have had the opportunity to continue to argue this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet some of the best aspects of being a member of parliament are the opportunity to participate in a cooperative activity and the friendships which grow through sharing in the political process. I owe more to Ralph Willis than to any other member, for he gave me my major opportunity as an economic adviser and he has been happy to continue to discuss issues throughout the last 13 years. His intellectual rigour, commitment to principle, transparent integrity and wise political and human judgment were a firm foundation for many of the crucial aspects of policy while Labor was in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On many occasions I have appreciated Kim Beazley's willingness to consult and listen to suggestions. Kim's eloquence was vividly demonstrated by his speeches during President Clinton's visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gareth Evans's extraordinary intellectual energy is expressed through his constant interest in rigorous analysis and in feasible policy innovation. He was Australian's finest postwar foreign minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On indulgence, I and a large number of colleagues on this side of the House will take advantage of the normal valedictories at the end of next week to speak at length about John's career and the way in which we have valued our friendships with him over the years. But I would like to make one or two brief points today on behalf of the opposition, as this is John's last day in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John, in the words that he has used, has portrayed the essential aspects of his character. One aspect is the capacity to exercise a generous heart. He has been more generous to his colleagues than he has been to himself in the remarks that he has made in his farewell to this place. He managed, despite his strictures upon himself, to give just about all of us a guernsey. His very Christian spirit, which has informed his life, and his humility and friendship are obvious in the way in which he has handled his remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has been done a great honour in the appointment that he has received. He does not leave this place for any dilatory reason. He leaves because he is going to be the most senior official of Australian origin in the United Nations when he takes up his position next year as Director of the Social Policy Division of the United Nations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That division in that international body carries with it the hopes of hundreds of millions of people, that their plight, their concerns, their issues and their needs will have the attention of the world community&mdash;those who can do something about these matters&mdash;well and truly focused on them. It is a heavy burden that he will bear, when he goes to that body, to ensure that the many resolutions of the United Nations and the conferences that have been held to consider these matters&mdash;at which many ministers and many diplomats from many governments often make pro forma speeches&mdash;are actually held to the words put down on paper or sent out into the ether, and that they actually do the job that they've promised to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has probably been no person in this parliament more fit to hold that position than John. If you go over the record of John's speeches, two things strike me&mdash;they may strike other people differently. One is that I often find things in them with which I disagree. But what I can never fault is the systematic logic that follows through each argument; that is underpinned by his social conscience&mdash;which will lead him in various directions; but he has never gone in a direction purely on emotional grounds. He takes that through as an intellectual exercise to ensure that his arguments are well honed. He has a capacity, therefore, to speak to people who might be of a different mind from himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having established a position which he has arrived at by his process of logic, he does not abandon it readily. One of the reasons, which I think he alluded to himself, why he has not enjoyed ministerial office is that he is one of the few people in this place who does not roll with the punches. The fact that he does not roll with the punches means that he gets hit pretty often.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are aspects of his life in this place which I am sure have been a matter of disappointment to him. But one thing which would never have been a matter of disappointment to him is the fact that he served here for a lengthy period and, as a member of parliament, did all the things effectively, correctly, innovatively and creatively that a member of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7881"> parliament ought to do in this place. He has been in parliament as the committee system of the House of Representatives has developed. He has used and enhanced the opportunities thus presented in ways which probably very few people in the parliament over that period have managed to emulate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has had an extraordinary background, as would befit somebody capable of attaining appointment to that post. He has been overseas studying development issues&mdash;to Papua New Guinea, for instance&mdash;and has been on the staff of successive leaders and frontbenchers, including a period on the staff of the former Prime Minister. I would have enjoyed watching the discussions between the two of them on the policy papers that he would have presented from time to time. But he has been a noted servant of the Labor Party for a very long period and, through the Labor Party, a noted servant of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot resist just one last minor jibe as John goes&mdash;a precedent has been established shortly before he has left&mdash;and that is that it is the first time I have actually had an admission out of John that the processes by which the defence vote declined as a percentage of GDP have been acceptable, and he has pronounced himself satisfied&mdash;by implication&mdash;with the contemporary position, in what he has had to say. This has been a source&mdash;you might understand&mdash;of some dispute between Mr Langmore and me over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude with this point: his motivation has always been the creation of a decent opportunity in life for all humanity and a deep and abiding concern for the peace of the world and the need for it to be free of conflict. With that type of attitude of mind he will do us, as a people, honour not only by simply holding this particular position but also in the way in which he holds it, the policies pursued and the programs developed that will have underpinning them the motivation that goes with one of the most decent consciences in this country.</PARA>

Of you, John, that will never be said. You are very much an Australian. You have made a contribution here, you have made a contribution in Papua New Guinea, you have made a contribution as an academic and as a parliamentarian, and you have certainly made an incredible contribution to the parliamentary committee system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Sometimes an opportunity is presented to us in parliament to highlight the contrast between opposition and government on a fundamental or a defining issue. This is one such occasion. On many occasions, the matters debated between government and opposition, between members of parliament and between political <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parties in parliamentary debates are complex issues. Their impact is remote and often not felt directly by the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here today, however, we have the opportunity to make a simple, direct and substantial contrast on a matter that goes to the very heart of the living standards of Australian families. The issue of wages, the level of wage increases, who gets those wage increases, how substantial they are and what workers have to do to get them: these are fundamental issues that affect the living standards of every Australian worker and everybody in the family of every Australian worker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning I had the privilege of presenting, on behalf of the opposition, our submission to the living wage case being heard by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That submission makes very clear and very stark the contrast between the government and the opposition on wages. It is unusual for an opposition to make a submission like that, and those who take the opportunity to read it will realise that we have made it clear this is not a practice we intend to pursue regularly. Rather, it was an initiative generated by two particular circumstances related to this application at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it involves the extent to which the principles underpinning this application date back to decisions in which many of us on the frontbench of the opposition were involved. We feel that, particularly having seen the nature of the government's submission, many elements of agreement which were entered into by the Australian trade union movement on behalf of Australian workers and which underpinned the move to enterprise bargaining may be undermined. We felt that, as one party to that agreement, we should speak up for the principles that underpinned it. Secondly, this is a very important case. Not every year in which wage principles are reviewed is there a review as fundamental as that associated with this year's living wage claim. For those two reasons, we felt we would make a one&hyphen;off submission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that what the government is offering is miserably inadequate in the current circumstances: in the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, in the climate of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7883"> the social changes that are being undertaken and at the end of five years of economic growth. Worse are the constraints that the government, in its submission, seeks to place on the increase. It denies any benefit at all from this increase to hundreds of thousands of workers dependent upon safety net increases for any wage increase they might receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those workers are not dependent on safety net increases just for today or for next year. If the submission of the government were to be accepted by the Industrial Relations Commission, virtually a million workers would face the prospect of no wage increase at all for the remainder of the century. This issue was raised today with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) in question time. He cracked a few rather bad jokes and changed the subject because he had no answer to the obvious fact that it is unquestionably true that one million workers who would have received a safety net increase under the principles set down by the previous government and operating at the moment as a consequence of the 1995 decision will not do so if the government's submission is accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how do these two significantly unsatisfactory results&mdash;the miserable nature of the increase and the narrow constraints placed on those to whom they might apply&mdash;come about? The miserable nature of the offer is established by the chart which accompanies our submission. It shows that workers on the lowest award wage&mdash;and this is the point at which there is the highest propensity for safety net increases to flow: workers at the lower area of award wage increases&mdash;will have the real value of their wage cut by about $15 over the next three years. They will have the real value of their wage cut every year, and by the end of the three years they will be $15 a week worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the fall in the real value of wages will be greater for everybody whose award is above that lowest level. The percentage increase will be less and the proportionate fall will be more so that every worker who depends upon this government's submission for his or her living standards will see their living standards fall.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Often when charts like this are presented people challenge the underlying assumptions. I knew there was a great risk that in any such submission that would be the government's response. But I had a very easy solution. I took the press release of the now Minister for Industrial Relations  of June 1995 when he assessed the adequacy of the $14 increase offered by the previous government, replicated exactly the assumptions which he put in his paper&mdash;his figures, his assumptions&mdash;and they damned him from his own mouth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising that the figures came out with that conclusion, because the minister said last year that a $14 a week offer by the previous government was inadequate. Yet, 15 months later, he comes with an offer barely half that. It is doubly inadequate. If $14 was unsatisfactory, this is doubly unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the minister is now trying to change the mode of assessment, trying to bring new factors in rather selectively. He has a selective fascination with the potential impact of the family tax package on some workers but fails to mention the impact that health insurance charges, pharmaceutical benefits and the like will have on them. All of these are affecting the living standards of every Australian family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the minister shows in his June 1995 too&hyphen;smart&hyphen;by&hyphen;half press release is that what the government is advocating is a fall in real wages for the lowest paid Australians. In fact, the government is proposing a fall in real wages for everybody who depends on the award for their wage increase&mdash;and that is 29 per cent of the work force, about three million Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it gets worse. For 11 per cent of the work force, about a million Australian workers, the government's recommendation is that there should be no wage increase at all&mdash;nothing; zero. These workers are in three categories. The first category is those who have pre-existing over-award payments&mdash;and those people are not necessarily very well paid; they could be earning as little as $18,000 a year. But the government says that they are taking too big a share of the economic output, that they should get no wage increase. These people's annual wage is less <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7884"> than the weekly wage increase for the chief executives of some of our largest companies; yet the government says they should get nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second category is those on paid rate awards&mdash;and their case was very effectively put by the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) in question time today. I am sure all the workers of Fraser heard those words with telling effect, because it affects most of the workers in that electorate. This government believes they should get no wage increase at all. Their wage will be recalculated as a minimum and an overaward component, and they will get no increase at all until the overaward component is absorbed&mdash;that is, teachers, nurses and public servants. The government's recommendation is that they should get nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third category is those whose award rate is more than average weekly ordinary time earnings&mdash;that is, more than about $35,000 a year. I thought those were people who were John Howard's battlers, but they are now fat cats who would have to work for 10 years just to earn enough to meet the costs of the city penthouse of the Minister for Industrial Relations. But they earn too much to get any increase at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that, even if they cannot win an enterprise bargain increase, they should get nothing, that they should not have access to any award increase at all. So the most fundamental factor determining the living standards of battling Australian families is the income coming in. You want to freeze it at zero for a million Australians. It is just not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The safety net increase needs to be greater. The tables attached to our submission suggest that to maintain the real wages of the lowest paid it needs to be about $15&mdash;certainly not less than $14&mdash;just to maintain the real value of the minimum award rate for the lowest paid worker. That does not take into account some crucial questions which the government's submission absolutely ignores. Where is the share of the five years of economic growth for those low paid workers? Where is their return on the significant increase in Australian productivity over the last five years? Where is their reward for all the pain <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the difficult process of change and adjustment the Australian work force has been going through?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, they can all resort to enterprise bargaining for their increase&mdash;and many workers will. But people should not be blackmailed into enterprise bargaining; they should not be bludgeoned into it. If they cannot win an enterprise bargain in their workplace, they should still have some capacity to maintain their living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a key role for enterprise bargaining. An incentive to enter into such agreements remains appropriate. But many workplaces are currently entering into their fourth or fifth round of enterprise bargaining, and bargaining fatigue is beginning to set in. There are many people who have never had an enterprise bargaining increase. All they have had since 1991 is the $24 safety net from the previous government. A million of those will get nothing further for the rest of this century. Twenty&hyphen;four dollars for eight years&mdash;that is this government's policy for some of the lowest paid and most vulnerable of Australia's workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even many of those who have had enterprise bargaining and have had success in enterprise bargaining are saying `enough'. You certainly will not as a government, and no employer will, win productivity increases in Australia's workplace by dragging reluctant workers to the negotiating table for a round of enterprise bargaining they do not wish to enter that will make them feel more insecure, more uncertain and more apprehensive about their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the economy there is room to be more generous than your miserable offer. Our not less than $14 option still allows for overall wage outcomes to be well within the Reserve Bank of Australia's comfort zone. It looked that way to us last year when we made the recommendation. The data suggests that it is still true. Our proposal adds only 0.25 per cent to the existing wage growth figures and, therefore, will bring wage outcomes to about four per cent, consistent with the RBA's inflation target of two per cent to 2&half; per cent&mdash;in fact, well below the level of wage <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7885"> increases that would drive it to the increase in inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leaves us with the vital question: if it is economically responsible to offer more than $8, if it makes our society fairer to offer more than $8 and if it helps the living standards of ordinary Australians to offer more than $8, why didn't the government do it? The answer is clear. The conservative side of politics has had a longstanding antipathy to wage increases and they have had a manic desire to force people off the award system. It meant that their ambition was not to offer as much as they could justify but to offer as little as they could get away with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might have been a very interesting ploy in the industrial relations minister's competition with the Treasurer (Mr Costello)&mdash;the way this $8 increase was offered&mdash;but it is a very miserable offer. The only thing about the offer which I welcome is the opportunity it provides to make a stark contrast between government and opposition and to illustrate the real difference to Australian workers between an Australian Labor Party government and a conservative government. Now we know that the difference is at least $1,000 a year.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should look at the member for Forde (Mrs Elson)&mdash;another person with a solid background, representing the battlers of Eagleby and Beenleigh, who really know <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7886"> what it is like and have been doing it tough under the regime of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we should look at the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro), representing working-class areas such as Redcliffe and Chermside. Look at the background she had and the hard work she had to do to get to where she got. She understands the battlers. She worked in the restaurants, she worked hard and she got her hands dirty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we should look at other members such as the member for Bowman (Mrs West), representing areas such as Wynnum and Lota, other battler areas of Queensland.

The member for Griffith (Mr McDougall) represents such battler areas as Morningside and East Brisbane.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other quotes. Bill Hayden, another famous Labor minister and long time Labor member in this place who represented a very working&hyphen;class area, said in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the . . . bullying . . . by several, largely self&hyphen;appointed, political elites . . . determined to have us toe the line on what they state to be politically correct.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on in a similar vein. The opposition does not want to listen to people who make sense, such as the former Senator Walsh, a former finance minister on their side. You do not want to listen to him because he does not make sense! There used to be people on that side of the House who knew about hard work&mdash;something you blokes do not know about. There used to be people like Clyde Cameron and Mick Young over there, who were both shearers. Those people made sense. They were the true&hyphen;blue Labor blokes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people listened to the working class. They are not here any longer. It is these people on this side of the House&mdash;people such as the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) and others&mdash;who are listening to the people, to the battlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have no more of this unctuousness&mdash;there is another word for the member for Melbourne&mdash;this pretension of fervour. If the opposition had really cared about these battlers, they would have passed the industrial relations bill, instead of holding it up for months in the Senate whilst they went on a sortie all over the country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, we have to turn the debate to a number of very important things. What will the offer made by the government in the context of the $1 billion tax initiative that is coming up from 1 January do for the battlers? It is going to provide a person who is supporting children&mdash;particularly where one of them is under five&mdash;with $19.20 per fortnight. What is wrong with that? That is money in the pocket, that is real money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not forget the assistance we are offering in relation to private health insurance. Above all, do not forget the interest rate drop we have achieved.

Of course, in the context of this particular debate they do not want to talk about the real people suffering out there; that is, the people who are unemployed. What did a very famous Labor Treasurer say in 1994? Do you remember him? Does the honourable member for Melbourne remember him? What did he say? He said that one man's wage increase is another man's job. Do you ever think about the unemployed? Do you ever consider them in this equation? Do you ever think that perhaps they would like a job? You just do not want to think about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is a classic example. He has never had a real job <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7888"> in his life.

They have ignored the fact that we are committed to families by way of the family tax initiative. They have ignored the advice of real labour people who are telling them they are out of touch, out of step and out of kilter. Is it any wonder that they are that minority on the other side and they are going to stay that way? What we are going to see is just more of this bleating and more of this gloom and doom.

It is those workers&mdash;those rural workers, those in the repressed industries <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7889"> of that nature where enterprise bargaining has not occurred&mdash;who need government assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Buchanan from ACIRT at Sydney University has said that, while some 35 per cent of employees have been successful in negotiating enterprise agreements over the past five years, they have had wage increases of 4.8 per cent. On the other hand, those left on basic award conditions have had rises of only 1.3 per cent, as against inflation rates of three to six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that enterprise bargaining has left a lot of those ordinary workers behind. The fact of the matter is that Labor had on its agenda the safety net increase of $14 to address that. If the government does not participate and does not address the situation faced by those people, they are simply left under the enterprise bargaining framework to negotiate terms and conditions of surrender. It is about time that the government realised the reality of that. In answer to a question today, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) said, `Well, it's now a regime where the majority of workers are going to receive their pay increases by negotiation.' There are so many workers&mdash;about three million Australians&mdash;who are not in a position, because of their particular industry or occupation, to achieve pay increases by negotiation. This government has left them well and truly behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister referred to executive payments. I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> this morning that the government is supporting payments of up to $700,000 a year for its senior executives. And it is saying that ordinary Australians are not entitled, for a full week's work, to $368 a week! The reality is starkly demonstrated today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. It is quoting figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics which show that families on this level of income can afford just $6.50 a week for red meat, $1.80 a week for poultry and $1.74 a week for fish. Most of us sitting here in these comfortable leather seats would spend more than that each night for our dinner. Those families spend less than $10 a week on dairy products, eggs, margarine and oils, and just over $10 a week <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on fruit, nuts and vegetables.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What are the consequences of people being poor? Some are obvious, such as the frustration and guilt&mdash;and often despair&mdash;of people who simply don't have the means to cope with the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day living expenses which most of us manage without too much drama: paying the rent, getting about on public transport, putting food on the table, providing for the children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the effects go beyond these things. Poverty is actually a health hazard, connected with higher rates of mortality, chronic illness and use of hospitals.

They have forgotten what they have done to people in my electorate who are representative of the ordinary women and men of Australian society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1983 I watched the television with sadness as the effect of electoral defeat showed on the face of Malcolm Fraser. I always thought he was a very decent man. I did not spend a lot of energy dwelling on the defeat at the time, although I had sympathy with the Liberal side of politics, because I was very deeply involved in my life as a battler. I was raising two very young children and had to work part time to pay the household accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In March 1983, when Malcolm Fraser left office, the real variable housing interest rate, after discounting for inflation, was only 1.8 per cent. By 1989 people were paying 17.9 per cent. The real rate had escalated to 10.8 per cent. My family found this rate rise crippling. So did the many families around us. The sleepless nights caused by the worry this created is something that people should not have to live with. Since the March election&mdash;since the Howard government has been managing the economy&mdash;housing interest rates have already fallen three times. The variable rate has fallen from 10.5 per cent to 8.75 per cent. That reduction will save the average Australian family $145 on their monthly housing interest bill. If those opposite do not realise that these rate cuts had a beneficial impact on the living standards of ordinary Australian families, particularly the low&hyphen;income families who have less disposable income and, therefore, fewer choices about how they spend that income, then it is no wonder that I am standing here on this side of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the House with my colleagues and you lot are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was about this time that the colleagues of those opposite began to lose touch. They either did not care about or did not understand the effects that their handling of the economy was having on the ordinary families of Australia like mine. I was so angry about the effect of these rises on my family and on the families of my friends who lived in the same mortgage belt area that I decided to find out more about politics and the reasons behind such devastating decisions&mdash;decisions that so adversely affected ordinary families like my own. I sought to play an active part in the Australian political process. I chose to join the Liberal Party and to enrol at Flinders University to study politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As policy and law&hyphen;makers in this place, we all have a responsibility to develop policies and to pass laws that contribute to the empowerment of the people that we represent&mdash;the people of Australia&mdash;so that they can make their own decisions about the matters that affect their daily lives, and so that they can make those decisions with confidence that they will be able to carry them out. People are not empowered when they do not have the capacity to make those decisions or the confidence that they will be able to carry them out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hawke&hyphen;Keating era did not provide the people of Australia with the capacity or the confidence that they deserve to take control of their daily lives. The empowerment of the Australian people was not the goal of the previous government. That is why the Australian people rejected them on 2 March this year. In fact, phone calls to my office suggest that the previous government contributed to the disempowerment of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people believe that social security benefits are their right for life and that they should not have to make an effort to look for work to receive them. This is truly a sad state of affairs&mdash;that people do not want to make a contribution to the economic advancement of this country and that this attitude was perpetuated under the previous government. The Australian people became fed up. They knew that they were getting nowhere. They <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7891"> knew that the uncertainty generated by growing unemployment ranks threatened their security and the security of their families and neighbours. They knew, when they looked around them and saw the symptoms of the previous government's failure to produce employment opportunities for young Australians, that their rhetoric and their desire to stay in power was not met by their commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact and the despair amongst Australia's young people cannot be overlooked as a factor in your election defeat. It is indeed the greatest tragedy that our nation has to grapple with and the greatest priority that this government has to deal with. As I moved about my electorate last year, the young people I met told me they were sick of training programs and that they did not want to do another training program; they just wanted a job so they could enjoy a decent standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tragically, too many of the young people that I met did not have anything like the skills needed to be job ready. They were supported through successful programs like JPET, which the previous government introduced and then axed on 30 June last year. A great lot of sense that made at the time, I thought, to introduce a pilot program that was successful and then abandon the program and the young people it supported! I am proud to say this government has reinstated the JPET program. It will be of great benefit to the young people in my electorate who are not yet job ready.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tragically, many of these young people have often never had the benefit of a role model who gets up in the morning and goes to work. They never had the benefit of a role model who supported their family by earning an income and making a contribution to the wealth and stability of the country and, therefore, to the future of their families. Sadly, too many of them have not had this role model in either the form of a parent or grandparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These young people had to be supported through programs like JPET, through the work of the many wonderful organisations around the country like Y&hyphen;Train, a successful organisation in my electorate run by the YWCA, which has the job of assisting young <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people to become job ready. It has the job of teaching them the daily life skills that they didn't learn from their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They did not learn about these skills in their families because their families did not have these skills. It is perhaps this country's other great tragedy that some families are not equipped to pass on these and many other skills to their children so that they can become independent young adults and can make their own contribution to this country in a constructive and meaningful way. Too often their contribution is made using spray cans, needles, stolen property, alcohol and other harmful substances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a reality that any of us in this House should be in the least bit proud of. It is a reality that all of us should focus on and it is a reality that developed under the noses of the members of the previous government.

Too many had had bad experiences with the CES and with training providers. The people opposite did not hear this message.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7892">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the money from Working Nation was going into training programs that did not train people for the jobs that small employers were too scared to take them on for anyway. This scenario will change under the measures announced, which are to be implemented by this government to more effectively equip young people for existing employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small businesses were also telling me and every other coalition member and candidate around the country that they were drowning under a sea of paperwork and those opposite were not listening. Our response to this massive inhibitor to small business success is well known. The commitment to establish a task force to investigate ways to reduce the burden of paperwork on small business was met and the task force has reported back to the government with 62 recommendations. Our response should be announced in February next year. I note that this is less than one year since we came to office. Why didn't people on the other side respond in the 13 years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of all these barriers has been that small businesses have not employed more people. The effect was, therefore, that their capacity to produce more was not realised. The effect was, therefore, that less wealth was created. The drain, therefore, on the social security budget was not alleviated, governments did not receive income in the form of taxes that small business had the capacity to deliver and people who did not have jobs and had not had them for a long time still did not get them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is how the people on the other side managed the economy. This is how the people on the other side affected the living standards of the Australian people. What those opposite also failed to realise is that many small business operators are also low income earners. So many that I spoke to would also lay awake at night worrying about where the next job was coming from and how they were going to pay their bills. Those opposite did nothing for their living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) is not qualified to talk about living standards falling because he was a part of a government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that caused them to plummet. The people opposite were in power to oversee the increasing gap between the wealthy and the poor in this country. So how can those on the other side stand in this place and bleat because we make a realistic offer to the wage earners of Australia, a wage offer that Australian businesses can afford? That is beyond me. You on the other side ignore your own track record and the inability of your party in government over the past 13 years to effectively deal with the underlying social and economic problems that this country faces. Your inability to deal with these problems is the reason that the living standards of too many Australian families are unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is dedicated to dealing with the chaos that you left. This government is addressing the social and economic problems that this country faces, to bring about the empowerment of Australian families so that they will have meaningful choices available to them and so that they can make the decisions based on those choices that will benefit their lifestyles and their living standards. We will do it much better than you did.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be moving at the consideration in detail stage an amendment, which has been circulated, in relation to schedule 1, page 3, line 30 to page 4 line 11, omit item 6. It is with great disappointment that I turn to the second aspect of the bill before this House. Item 6 of schedule 1 of the bill repeals section 34D of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 and inserts a new provision. The purpose of this amendment to the act, the purpose of this new provision, is to allow the government to transfer funds distributable from the confiscated asset fund to consolidated revenue. Our amendment will maintain the status quo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, funds seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act are paid into a trust fund until such time as any legal proceedings in relation to those funds are determined. Where the Commonwealth is successful in proving that those funds or assets are the proceeds of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> crime, the funds become distributable for the purposes of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the establishment of the trust fund, $29.8 million has been paid in: $26.4 million as a result of funds seized pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, a further $3.3 million pursuant to the Customs Act 1901, and $22,000 pursuant to section 9 of the Crimes Act 1914. As at 31 July this year, the trust fund had a total of $7.25 million credited to it, of which $5.9 million was available for distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the present legislation, available funds are distributed once per year by the Attorney-General for two purposes. Fifty per cent of the funds are available for the funding of special law enforcement projects. In the 1995 funding round, $5.4 million was paid out of the trust fund to 10 law enforcement projects. These projects included $450,000 to enhance the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's fraud detection system; $290,000 to the Department of Immigration  and Multicultural Affairs movement alert system, a system designed to detect and monitor the attempted movements of undesirables to Australia; and $1.8 million to the National Crime Authority to assist with its telecommunications intercept capabilities. Other recipients included the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Institute of Criminology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1994 funding round, a further $5.2 million was distributed to 20 law enforcement projects in sums ranging from $54,500 to $675,000. Recipients included the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Taxation Office. Collectively, these measures have provided an invaluable boost to Australia's law enforcement capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other 50 per cent of the funds are available for drug education and rehabilitation projects. Since 1992-93, the Department of Health and Family Services has received a net total of $7.638 million from the trust fund, $11.86 million gross. These moneys have been used to support additional projects under the national drug strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Activities funded during that period include the second phase of the `Speed catches up <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7894"> with you' public education and awareness campaign; a campaign designed to promote awareness about the effect of amphetamines; an annual conference held in Sydney in June 1994 on the principles of developing and implementing a balanced national drug strategy to address the problems of drug abuse; the production of a general resource document on the health effects of cannabis and a time series analysis of the patterns of use, and community attitudes towards the use, of cannabis; a technical study of the toxic effects of MDMA, otherwise known as ecstasy; and the national initiatives in drug education program. This consisted of two phases&mdash;the ongoing comprehensive training of teachers to develop skills and knowledge in relation to drug education and, subsequently, the extension of this education to parents and to industry and community groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trust fund has also been used in the past to supplement the budget of the national drug strategy when funds were otherwise unavailable. In two years the base funding of the strategy was supplemented by $2 million advances against future allocations from the trust fund. The use of these advances explains the $4 million differential between the net and gross figures I provided previously for allocations from the trust fund. Once again, all of these programs have been very valuable in increasing our awareness of the impact of drugs on our community and providing us with some of the resources we need to tackle these difficult and complex issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is wrong with these funds being transferred to consolidated revenue rather than directly to these projects? No doubt the government will say that the mere transfer of the funds available under the trust fund to consolidated revenue will not stop funds being available for these purposes, but the budget makes a lie of those assertions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Across the board this government has cut the budget of our law enforcement agencies. The Australian Federal Police will have its budget cut by $26.5 million over the next two years. The Australian Customs Service will be cut by $73 million over four years. We heard in question time today the great service they are doing. Their funds should be increased, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not cut. Cuts already announced to the Australian Customs Service have resulted in the loss of adequate border protection in many major regional centres and the virtual conversion of the Australian Customs Service to a nine to five operation. If only criminals worked office hours!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Crime Authority, Australia's premier law enforcement agency in the fight against organised crime, will have its budget cut by $11.3 million over the next three years&mdash;almost 20 per cent of its budget. That is a cut which the Chairman of the National Crime Authority, Mr John Broome, has already admitted will&mdash;far from making the NCA more efficient, as claimed in the government's election commitments&mdash;reduce the authority's investigative capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will be particularly noticeable in South Australia and Western Australia. Staff at the authority's Adelaide office are being reduced from 33 to only 10. In Perth staff numbers will be cut from 27 to 15. I must say, in fairness to other officers of the NCA who have been affected by these cuts, that a further 20 staff have lost their jobs in Melbourne, 12 in Sydney and three in Brisbane. However, the relative impact of these cuts has been most noticeable in the Adelaide and Perth offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cuts will effectively remove the ability of the NCA to conduct ongoing on the ground operations in South Australia and the West. As any good police officer will tell you, unless you have your police on the ground and familiar with local conditions it is almost impossible to do your job properly.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4T4">Mr MELHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. This government's abandonment of South Australia and Western Australia is reminiscent of the rightly maligned defence <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7895"> policy known as the Brisbane Line where the government only committed itself to defending Australia south of Brisbane. In the war against drugs and organised crime such a policy should not be allowed to rear its ugly head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Australians are deserving of protection from the evils of drug importation and organised crime. No Australian or group of Australians should have to fend for themselves, particularly when those Australians are often at the forefront of that war. All Australians should be concerned that this government is giving the drug barons and crime lords the green light in South Australia and the West.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying today is that there is cross-party support for this. This can be justified. That is why we support the bill, but we are moving this particular amendment in relation to this. I do not believe that the community would worry about money going into consolidated revenue if it can be properly accounted for. That is the point I am trying to make in relation to this debate. That is why we have moved this particular amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position is that the government has also cut $0.5 million, over 15 per cent, from the budget of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board. One has to wonder how this body will continue to effectively assist federal and state law enforcement bodies coordinate their activities after a cut of this magnitude. The money could be used for these aspects of policing. The CLEB not only performs these routine functions but in the last year has had added to its responsibilities the coordination of the new uniform national gun laws, the national paedophile register and the National Missing Persons Bureau.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the government has cut $160,000 a year from research on the criminal justice response to violence against women. This funding was announced under the previous Labor government's Justice Statement. Despite all its posturing before the election about the need to protect women from domestic violence, this government has turned around and cut funding to a program that would help us all to understand&mdash;so as to fix one of the principal reasons why too many women choose not to report domestic violence&mdash;the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> criminal justice system, the very system that is supposed to protect women in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In total, the federal budget has seen nearly $120 million taken out of Australia's fight against crime. So much for giving our law enforcement officials the resources they need. But I do wish to give the government credit where credit is due. The only new spending proposal in the law and order field is the government's establishment of the national campaign against violence and crime. The additional $3 million to be allocated over the next three years is a welcome addition to the $1 million per year announced in the Justice Statement for the safer Australia program. However, it is disappointing that this is less than the $5 million per year promised to the Australian people by the coalition in its law and justice policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Safer Australia represented an innovative entry by the Commonwealth into the funding of community based safety projects. Headed by an independent board shared by two outstanding Australians, Ruth Cracknell and Margaret Whitlam, the board made recommendations to the federal government for the funding of 21 community based safety projects. These included the `safe as houses' project proposed by the Cairns City Council, which aimed to reduce the level of home burglaries; the Council of the Ageing's video in five languages outlining some of the causes of fear for older people about burglary and home assault; Phantast's anti-graffiti project in south-east Queensland; and the Victorian Council of Churches projects to reduce crime in public spaces by finding alternative activities for young people in their community education campaign aimed at educating non-English speaking background communities on the dangers of carrying weapons and knives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The money could be given to these programs rather than going into consolidated revenue. I think that is something that the whole of the Australian community would endorse and support. It is not a political issue. This crosses party barriers. That is why we are going to move this amendment to the government's bill. We believe that a few more riders should be added to allow funding <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7896"> to go to these programs. It should not be put into consolidated revenue. That is the point that I was making earlier in relation to our amendment and is why I outlined those programs. They are worthwhile initiatives that should be continued. They do not have to suffer budget cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of this money going into consolidated revenue, it should go across the board into these programs. It is making the criminals pay. It is one way of sending the message that, if we catch the proceeds from a person's crime, this is a direct way in which the money can go back. It is going back in a positive fashion to clean up the mess that that crime has caused rather than going into consolidated revenue. That is what our amendment is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government gave a commitment during the election campaign that, if it was returned, it would fund these projects. Regrettably for these community groups we were not returned. So we are saying that the government should not put this money into consolidated revenue. Instead, it should send it across to these projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current government froze funding for the safer Australia program, despite promising to meet all funding commitments made by the previous government in the 1995 financial year. As a result, none of these valuable and innovative projects has received a cent. Given that the national campaign against violence and crime is yet to be launched, a matter which I trust will be rectified early in the new year, they have had no means to obtain Commonwealth funding since that time. It saddens me to say that the government's treatment of these community groups has been wasteful of their time and contemptuous of their commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to establish the national campaign against violence and crime as soon as possible. I also urge him to give special consideration to these 21 most deserving projects that have been waiting so long for the funding they deserve. What can we conclude about this government's law and order budget? Whilst no-one would suggest that this government actively supports organised crime, its inaction, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its negligence and its lack of commitment mark it out as a government that does not have the fortitude for the fight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the realm of law and order the budget represents a litany of lies and broken promises. The Attorney-General and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have betrayed the Australian people. In doing so, they have put ordinary Australians in the firing line. Their record is not any better when it comes to drug education and rehabilitation. The primary role of these programs is not just to reform drug users, thereby improving the quality of their lives. Both education and rehabilitation are a critical means of making our homes, our streets and our workplaces safer for all Australians&mdash;safer from the misery and destruction that drugs cause in our society. That is what some of the money could be used for rather than having it go into consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are sound and proven programs that reduce the likelihood of crimes, and not just drug related crimes, from being committed in the future. The drug culture of Australia is surrounded by the commission of property offences and violent crime. A large proportion of home invasions in this country are carried out by drug users seeking cash or readily saleable goods, such as VCRs and televisions, to fund their drug habit. We all too regularly read in our papers of drug related killings, not to mention the often high level of non&hyphen;lethal violence that permeates drug culture. Prostitution, youth homelessness and abuse are all too often connected with the prevalence of drugs in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prevention is better than cure. The money should be going to prevention; it should not be going into consolidated revenue. This government's withdrawal of funding which either stops young Australians entering this unsavoury world or which helps drug users kick the habit will only see this blight on our society spread. Every Australian will pay for this lack of foresight in higher insurance premiums on their homes or in the ruined lives of their children or their friends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This aspect of the bill is ill&hyphen;conceived and short-sighted. In this government's desperate dash for cash, it has lost sight of the reasons <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7897"> why we are elected to government: to make Australia a safer and happier place for us all. This bill will save the government a miserly $12.83 million over four years, even if one makes the assumption, which I do not believe can be made, that all the moneys currently held in the trust fund will ultimately be distributable. Yet these funds provide much needed additional assistance to our law enforcement agencies and help those otherwise tempted by drugs to say no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, at the considertion in detail stage I will move the amendment that I have circulated. However, regardless of the vote on the amendment, I wish to note that the opposition will support the bill. If we do fail, I urge the government to reconsider its decision not to effectively use the moneys that will be paid into consolidated revenue for law enforcement, drug rehabilitation and education purposes. No matter how misguided this government's policy on the use of the moneys available from the confiscated assets trust fund may be, the facilitation of cooperation between Australian and international law enforcement agencies to track down those proceeds must be our priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without our commitment to that cause, no funds will be made available through the trust fund at all. More importantly, we would be failing to send international criminals a signal of our resolve, and we would be failing to give our law enforcement agencies the assistance that they need to get on with the job.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding Australian who is retiring as Chairperson of ATSIC tomorrow, and that is Dr Lois O'Donoghue CBE, AM. Lois O'Donoghue has given outstanding service to the Australian community, and I think it is appropriate that she is recognised by the parliament today. Lowitja is her Aboriginal name. She was born at Indulkana <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in central South Australia and is a member of the Yankunytjatjara people of north&hyphen;west South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr O'Donoghue was the inaugural full-time Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission from its inception in 1990 until her retirement on 6 December, 1996. Dr O'Donoghue received the Order of Australia award in 1977, was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1983 and in 1984 was honoured as Australian of the Year in recognition of her outstanding contribution to the welfare of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 Dr O'Donoghue was a leading member of the Aboriginal negotiating team which negotiated with the federal government the agreement which provided the basis for the Native Title Act. Lois O'Donoghue has received honorary doctorate awards from the Murdoch University in Western Australia, the universities of Flinders and Adelaide in South Australia, the Australian National University in Canberra and the Queensland University of Technology. She is also a Honorary Fellow of the Australian Royal College of Nursing. She has outstanding professional qualifications: she has professional qualifications as a trained nurse and a mental health nurse. She was also a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first met Lois O'Donoghue in 1993 during the discussions surrounding the Native Title Act. She is an outstanding individual. With her bubbly personality, she has guided ATSIC through its inception, through tortuous years, through the harrowing period of a change of government&mdash;but she has done it with dignity, with honour and with a genuineness that I think reaches out to all Australians. She is a truly wonderful person. I am honoured and privileged to have been associated with her, to be able to call her a friend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Her public service will not cease; she will continue to give outstanding public service. I am sure that even the new government, the new minister, has an excellent relationship with her. It is not easy to hold the position that she has held. If you think it is hard politics in this chamber in mainstream Australia, there are no tougher politics than <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7898"> indigenous politics in this country. Not only do you have to contend with politics in the broad community, you have to contend with them within your own community&mdash;and Lois has handled herself with distinction. She is a truly outstanding advocate for her people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the sentiments which I am expressing are shared across the political spectrum, across the political divide. I think it right that she do move on. It is time for a changing of the guard. And it is time that we recognise there should be no divides. There is a new dawn, and she will be part of it. The very manner in which she has handled the transition of government has guaranteed the survival of ATSIC. She was moderate throughout the last couple of months, and I think she has made a number of moving speeches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lois O'Donoghue is someone special. She enriches this country. She enriches all of us. She enriches her people. She is not a bitter person. She has been subjected to some terrible things over the years&mdash;and yet she carries herself with distinction and without malice, without ill-feeling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sort of message we want to continue in terms of reconciliation: an equal partnership, walking hand in hand with each other. We have our differences of opinion. We need to respect those differences&mdash;not, in effect, to highlight them. That is what enriches us. Lois O'Donoghue was, and still is, an outstanding spokesperson for her people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also makes me wonder about motive, when part of one of these claims is the war memorial in Faulkner Park; a claim has been placed over this particular icon in the city of Belmont.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because a drainage reserve runs through part of the oval. My concern about this is: what is the motivation? What can you do with a drainage reserve that is five metres wide, or whatever it is, which is already developed? Are you ever going to build anything there? Are you ever going to do anything meaningful with it? And a road reserve&mdash;it does not have title as such. What do they intend to do on a reserve like this?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some sort of cynicism that this might be a claim more for what can be got out of it rather than any recognition. I think there is some sort of curious grab for land being made for which they want to be compensated. I do not often quote Wilson Tuckey, but Wilson says that the price of absolution is 30 pieces of silver&mdash;so, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will leave the inference to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very concerning part about all of this is: where do we go from here? Is this a strategy whereby these people are combing all the parks and reserves of all the local government authorities? Is the Canning council next? Is the Victoria Park town council next? Is the South Perth city council next? Are they going to identify every park and reserve in that city and try to lay an ambit claim over them? Already within the city of Belmont, there are two overlapping claims on the airport. Currently, those claims are in the Federal Court under a directional hearing. At the moment this hearing gives some possible uncertainty to the privatisation of the Perth airport.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7899">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very disappointed that these things take so long to determine. The Belmont City Council are very concerned because they now have to employ, at ratepayers' expense, a large number of staff to help with the determination of these claims. They then have to engage legal advice. As we know, these claims take some time to determine. This could go on for years. Two years is possibly the shortest period that these claims will go for before there is any direction about them. The only successful claims so far have been the original claim in the Murray Island, the Mabo case itself, and the one small claim in New South Wales. With all the hundreds of claims out there, these are the only ones that have had some determination made about them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am relaxed about native title; the whole concept of native title is good. But at the moment it is an unworkable mess and it is only the legal fraternity who are getting much out of it. The genuine Aboriginals who are seeking some determination over the land which they can rightfully claim have gotten nothing. This flawed legislation brought in during the previous parliament under the Labor Party brings nothing but hostility to a community when something like this happens&mdash;66 claims over parks and reserves within the city of Belmont.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much has been said over the months and very recently about the role of Canberra as the national capital. When I read the comments of former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  newspaper yesterday, I thought, `Enough is enough.' The people of Canberra, the businesses attempting to invest in Canberra and the families investing their future in Canberra just do not deserve this; neither does anyone who historically had anything to do with the establishment and development of Canberra as the national capital. Heaven forbid, foremost on that list is the late Sir Robert Menzies, who put so much of himself <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and his faith into the national capital and the reasons for its existence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people around the country happen to agree with the sentiments of Menzies and I would like briefly to refer to the report of the National Capital Authority entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Impressions of Australia</EMPHASIS>. There are a couple of very good quotes that I would like to share with the House. One states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My view is that the single biggest imperative for the planning of Canberra is to turn it into a society where we can be proud because it is sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA>That came from a gentleman participating in the Brisbane workshop that was behind that report. Another general comment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, quantitative research conducted in 1992 found that 82 per cent of respondents considered it was important for Australians to feel proud of their national capital.</PARA>
<PARA>One more very brief quote from a Perth participant in the process states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm proud of Canberra. I enjoy Canberra. As an Australian, I expect the best and a lot of Canberra does deliver that.</PARA>
<PARA>But what in fact do we have now? A Prime Minister who refuses to live in the Lodge, and I wonder&mdash;in fact, I despair&mdash;at the precedent that that sets. Does it mean that when we have future prime ministers living in, say, Perth, or Darwin, or Brisbane, or Hobart, or Melbourne they should do the same as the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard)?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have an ex&hyphen;Liberal Prime Minister who bags the ACT mercilessly and quite stupidly in the national press. I wonder why? According to Mr Fraser, we have four main groups living in Canberra: the military, politicians, public servants and journalists. He says that he is appalled at the steady and continuing growth of Canberra. Well, Mr Speaker, he can rest easy. Canberra, as a community of Australia and as the national capital in which Menzies and others so much believed, is being so severely affected by this non-resident Prime Minister and his lot that we may well end up with just journalists, politicians, public servants and military personnel&mdash;and that will be if we are lucky.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister promised that no more than 2,500 Public Service jobs would go. That promise was made in the election campaign&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7900">obviously a non-core promise. It was announced in the budget that 10,500 Public Service positions alone were to go, and they were on top of the 10,000 or so already gone since the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall clearly the words of the current Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) during the campaign. He said, `We will cut Canberra off at the knees.' How true those words are today. There is a business community in the ACT which is local, believes in the national capital and has backed that belief over the years with investment and growth. They have lived and invested here honestly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this community wants is honesty from the politicians. If the Prime Minister has decided to relocate the national capital to Sydney, or maybe share it between Sydney or Melbourne or whatever else is his design, let him tell the Australian community and let him explain why future Clinton&hyphen;type visits may have to be between several places so as to see what we might call the national capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the ACT Chief Minister and her government are concerned, feigning disagreement with this federal conservative government is just not good enough. Her policies are the same. With an ACT election just over 12 months away, it is easy to guess what her motives could be. The effect of all this political posturing is the continuing decline of our local growth, our local economy and our local confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many are doing everything they can to steer Canberra through this difficult time. This community happens to believe in the national capital, in the place where they live. I know Canberra will survive because of this community's determination. The hardship for the families, the broken small businesses and the redundant public servants will not forget this ongoing Canberra bashing. The Howard and Carnell governments stand condemned.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last couple of days we have had the privilege of hosting in Canberra two fine young Australians who were the winners for 1996 of the Fisher electorate essay competition. They are Cassie Dee Hughes of year 5 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from the Mt Kilcoy State School and Fiona Hardy, a year 10 student from the Yarraman P-10 State School. Both students delivered essay entries on the topic `The Australia I would like to see in the year 2000'. I would like to read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  these two entries as points of view which honourable members would no doubt like to consider. Firstly, the essay by Cassie Dee Hughes states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that if the few things I've written in this essay were to be realised, our country would be a healthier and fairer place to live.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cities today are very busy. Traffic is increasing and so is pollution. People are getting more jobs and more buildings are being built. People are driving cars to work releasing poisonous smoke into the atmosphere. The increased use of public transport such as buses and trains would alleviate some of our pollution related problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Education is another thing I would like to talk about. I think that the University fees are much too high and this is not fair on low income earners. Schools should get more assistance because teachers are overworked and too tired to have fun with their families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A percentage of families today are either poor or unhappy. This causes the children to run away and a lot could happen such as rape and becoming involved with drugs. I believe that if families are closely bonded that children will have less difficulties as they grow up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginals are no different to us and I think it is cruel the way we treat them for I say we should be able to work, rest and play together.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian homes are getting very expensive and some people in our country can not afford them so they are forced to live in the street. Shelter is a basic need for everyone so that they can feel safe and happy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our country would be a healthier and fairer place to live in if there was less pollution, improved education, happier families, less racism and more affordable housing.</PARA>
<PARA>Now the essay by Fiona Hardy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is commendable to say that unemployment should be non&hyphen;existent by the year 2000 and other such statements; but in truth the year 2000 is but four years away and any solution between now and then would be a quick fix and more than likely cause more problems in the long run. It is therefore, more practical to `nip these problems in the bud', and attempt to solve these dilemmas before they start.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Children should be given more incentives to learn. Ausstudy was introduced to give such incentives <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7901"> and allowed access to higher education for all as was the HECC Scheme. The allowance is not enough to sustain an interest in studying and therefore it should be increased as to prevent the future problems of unemployment. This would aid in the nurturing of the intellectual ability of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"></PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Other">* * * * *</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I endeavour to present Australia as a non&hyphen;discriminatory country, as do most of the Australian population. It is becoming increasingly harder to do so. The current number of immigrants is believed to be excessive. The Regulations regarding Australian immigration are far too lenient and should be tightened to prevent people from rorting the system. As for the numbers of immigrants allowed into this island nation; these numbers are far too large for both our resources and our economy to cope. If immigration is not reduced we shall suffer from severe overpopulation. By the year 2000 immigrant intake should be sliced to an acceptable level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With overpopulation comes pollution. A problem that should be overcome by the human race as quickly as possible. It goes without saying that Australia is relatively lucky in this respect. We have clean air, reasonable water supplies and a peaceful atmosphere. We should strive to conserve such beauty. Although our laws regarding conservation of the environment are strict, they could perhaps be tightened or more rigidly enforced to preserve our unique surroundings. Artificial features should be kept to a minimum if dealing with imported ideas and/or species, e.g. Euro&hyphen;Disney.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"></PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Other">* * * * *</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new gun laws should be up and running by the year 2000. Although some amendments have to be made, as is the case with every new legislation. I believe the gun laws at present are now too lenient. No exceptions to the legislation should be made, no matter who it may inconvenience. The gun lobby is an extremist minority group that should be ignored at all costs. If necessary a referendum should be held as to determine that these proposed gun laws would be adequate for the country's population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, Australia is a fair and fine country with very few problems within society. The only outstanding problem I foresee is the current rate with which our population is growing. The ideal Monarchist, Democratic Australia would be one with little unemployment, tight restrictions regarding guns and the environment and an intellectually advanced population.</PARA>
<PARA>These two fine young people are wonderful representatives of their age groups. I congratulate them on winning their essay competitions. I know they had a wonderful time <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> meeting you, Mr Speaker, travelling around Parliament House and looking at the sights of Canberra.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Friday, 1 November at the 1996 Australian Tourism Awards in Perth, Featherdale Wildlife Park was awarded Australia's most prestigious tourism award in the category of significant tourist attraction. Situated only 40 minutes west of Sydney in the electorate of Greenway, en route to the beautiful Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park is home to Australia's largest collection of native animals. There are over 2,500, all of which are exhibited in a magnificent natural bushland environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Visitors to Featherdale enjoy numerous activities, including being photographed cuddling lovable koalas and handfeeding friendly kangaroos or inquisitive emus. The significant tourist attraction award highlights Featherdale's outstanding achievement in the Australian tourism industry. Over the past 12 months, Featherdale has received a record number of visitors, initiated by the development of a number of new and exciting visitor facilities and a continuation of the park's active role in conservation and preservation of rare and endangered wildlife, including being the last known home of Fatso the wombat, star of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Country Practice</EMPHASIS>. Featherdale also provides significant value&hyphen;added employment for local professionals, including my dentist, who was called in on one occasion to carry out some dental work on a chimpanzee resident of the park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a visit to Darwin I also had a personal experience of the Australia&hyphen;wide reputation of Featherdale. At the Northern Territory Wildlife Park, visitors are treated to a display by a number of eagles. The eagles are let loose by their trainers and then fly into surrounding trees. The eagles are then attracted back to their trainers, who wave a piece of fish or meat around. One of the eagles used in this display is a white&hyphen;breasted sea&hyphen;eagle which was bred at Featherdale and was the first such eagle raised in captivity. Featherdale has over <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7902"> 200 species of native birds, which are featured in aviaries landscaped with trees and plants from the Jabiru and Kakadu regions of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Featherdale was established on seven acres of land originally purchased by Charles and Marjorie Wiggs in 1953. Featherdale has evolved from a poultry farm into one of the best privately owned wildlife parks in Australia. With the vision and encouragement of the Wiggs's son&hyphen;in&hyphen;law, Bruce Kubbere, who had studied Australian fauna since his childhood, Featherdale opened to the public as a wildlife park in 1972.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the earlier years, Bruce and his wife Margaret operated a plant nursery in conjunction with the wildlife park. Beautiful Australian native trees and plants now line the walkways and landscape the enclosures as a legacy of the park's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A campaign to save Featherdale from housing commission resumption was formed in 1975. The then Premier of New South Wales, Sir Robert Askin, was presented with thousands of signed petitions. Most of the petitions were signed by local residents, who stressed the importance of Featherdale Wildlife Park to the district's school children. Fortunately, the government rescinded its original decision and the park was saved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Featherdale has developed into one of Australia's finest tourist attractions, and has played an integral part in the growth of tourism in the district of Blacktown in Sydney as well as the whole of New South Wales. The Blacktown local government area now boasts a number of significant man&hyphen;made attractions in addition to Featherdale Wildlife Park. We also have the Parklea Markets, Eastern Creek Raceway, Australia's Wonderland and outback woolsheds, plus attractions such as Nurragingy Reserve and Prospect Reservoir. These attractions make this part of western Sydney an interesting place to spend some time, see our outstanding tourist attractions and meet many friendly people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the ownership of Featherdale will soon change hands. I congratulate the Wigg and Kubbere families for a job well done in their contribution to wildlife in western Sydney. I wish both families <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all the best for the future and hope the new owners of Featherdale will maintain the high standard already set by these two great pioneering families.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening in the adjournment debate I want to bring to the attention of the House the results of a fairly important by-election that was held in New South Wales last Saturday&mdash;the by-election for the state seat of Port Macquarie. For the information of members, the successful candidate in that by-election was the National Party's Robert Oakeshott, whom some members of this staff, particularly staff of this place, would know quite well. Robert worked here for the last three years in my office as a media research officer and, latterly, he worked in the government members' secretariat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more interesting thing to note, particularly following the outcome of the by-election on Saturday, is some of the comments that have been made by some of the senior Labor politicians in New South Wales about the swings&mdash;who they went to and who they went against. In the field that stood for the by-election in Port Macquarie, there was no Labor candidate. The Premier of New South Wales decided that Port Macquarie was not a good enough seat for Labor to inject any funds into a campaign and stand a candidate. They did not think they could win, notwithstanding that they crowed about the fact that in 1995 at the March general election they received 38 per cent of the vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequent to that, the sitting National Party member resigned and the Premier called a by-election that took about three months to contest. It was a fairly lengthy period and a long campaign, yet there was no sign of any Labor candidate. Some of the other votes that were achieved in the election were quite interesting as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to the comments that were made by one of the Labor Party senior ministers in New South Wales who talked about a swing against the National Party in the seat of Port Macquarie. But what he failed to realise was that there were a number of Independent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7903"> candidates. One of those Independent candidates was a former high profile Liberal Party member who actually stood against me in the federal election in 1993, one John Barrett. John Barrett managed to achieve 32 per cent of the vote. Our candidate, the ultimate winner, the National Party's Robert Oakeshott, achieved 46.8 per cent of the vote. According to my arithmetic, that is almost 79 per cent of the vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we did not have Greens, the Shooters Party and AAFI, it would have left only 21 per cent for the Labor Party to win if they had stood a candidate. But they were too gutless and they wimped out because they knew what the result would be. They saw what happened in the federal by-election in Lindsay and decided that they would not embarrass themselves and stand a candidate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With 900 votes still to count yesterday, the National Party's Robert Oakeshott got 46.8 per cent of the vote, the conservative Independent, Barrett, got 32 per cent of the vote and the Shooters Party got 6.9 per cent of the vote&mdash;and this is the first real outing for the Shooters Party this year, apart from the Lindsay by-election. I cannot recall what result they got there, but I do not think they achieved that much. The Shooters Party actually brought workers and campaigners in from all over New South Wales. This was the big test for Mr Tingle's party, and it achieved nothing&mdash;6.9 per cent of the vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AAFI brought a candidate up from Sydney, put a bit of money into a campaign, ran a fairly high profile campaign in the last month leading up to the poll last Saturday and achieved 6.2 per cent of the vote. Of course, the Greens, like the Democrats, in these by-elections have collapsed. They achieved only 5.2 per cent of the vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just wanted to highlight to the House the lack of faith that the Labor Party have in their support and their branches in regional New South Wales where they are not prepared to stand a candidate, they are not prepared to put any money into a campaign and they certainly did not do it in the by-election in the state seat of Port Macquarie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than that, after achieving 38 per cent of the vote in the general election in March <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1995, it seems that there was probably only 21 per cent of the vote available for them to win in this by-election if they had bothered to stand a candidate, if Bob Carr had not wimped out and had been prepared to stand a candidate and represent the policies that he has been implementing in New South Wales since being elected in March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But he was not prepared to do that. He was not prepared to test his hand. He was not prepared to cop a message from people in regional New South Wales, who are sick to death of the policies of the Carr Labor government. Along with other members of this place, particularly from our side of this House, I congratulate Robert Oakeshott on his win last Saturday.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

But before I do, I need to comment on the enthusiasm with which the last speaker, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), referred to regional by&hyphen;elections in New South Wales. He seems to have forgotten the by-election in Clarence and the by-election in Orange, which were substantial vindications and which won substantial support for and swings to the Labor government and Mr Carr.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take the very brief time available to me to support the remarks made by my colleague the member for Namadgi about the continuing damage being done to the economy of the ACT by this government. Since there has been some speculation about the possibility of a by-election, the rhetoric has changed but the substance is unchanged. With an impending ACT election, we see the Chief Minister seeking to pretend that she is in some way distanced from and different in her attitudes from the federal Liberal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But she does not trumpet the fact that, when decisions are made and submissions are made by this government which are profoundly antagonistic to every worker in the ACT, namely, the submission to the living wage case, she is a signatory to that agreement and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7904"> that her government supports the Howard government's submission, which says that nobody on a paid rates award, which covers almost every worker in the ACT, should get any wage rise at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think all the working people in the ACT will want to give serious consideration to the implications of that message, as the people of Fraser will want to give serious consideration to the implications of that in the forthcoming by&hyphen;election. More broadly, I am concerned that the recent trend of events has led, for the first time since John Howard was last responsible for the national economy, to unemployment  in the ACT being higher than the national average.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996; that is, I favour overturning the Northern Territory law, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, which legalises assisted suicide and active measures to end life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not pretend that this is not an intrusion into the rights of self&hyphen;government in the Northern Territory. In my view it is. The Northern Territory was given self&hyphen;government to enact laws in accordance with Commonwealth statute and the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act was a valid enactment in accordance with that power. What the Commonwealth parliament is now doing is removing the power to legislate in that area and, what is more, removing the power to legislate in that area after there has been a valid enactment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the fact is that the Commonwealth has the power to do that, and this parliament is being asked to exercise that power. When the parliament is being asked to exercise the power and we, as members of the parliament, have to decide whether or not to exercise it, I do not think it is enough to say that this matter can be resolved according to the procedures of self&hyphen;government. I think that the bill before the parliament raises infinitely more important issues than that and, in the circumstances, it is the substantive issue, I believe, that we must address rather than the more narrow one of division of powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the same view in relation to the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994. In my view, the Tasmanian parliament had the power to exercise, and did exercise, legislative rights in relation to sexual conduct. But the Commonwealth parliament, in the circumstances, had the power to override that. It was asked to exercise that power and, in the circumstances, without pretending in any way that it was not an intrusion against the legislative powers of Tasmania, I thought that it should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not to say that I believe the Commonwealth parliament should override either state rights or territory self&hyphen;government in every circumstance. There are many circumstances&mdash;indeed, one might say the overwhelming number of circumstances&mdash;where it should not. But where it has the power to do that and it is asked to exercise that power, I believe it is important to focus on the substantive issue, particularly where it involves deep questions of personal behaviour or, as is the case in relation to this bill, questions of life and death.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7907">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Northern Territory legislature, I believe it did a good job, if you believe in the underlying principle. I do not quibble with the form that the Northern Territory act took and, if you support the principle of legalising assisted suicide or active measures to end life, I guess that is as good a job as could possibly be done. The supporters of that act will undoubtedly say that they did it in order to enhance the dignity of life; that part of the dignity of life is the dignity of death. Death comes to us all. I believe there are good deaths and there are bad deaths. Unquestionably, those in the Northern Territory parliament, according to their own beliefs, did the best job they could and I do not cast any aspersions on them whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But my view is a different one. My view is that the dignity of life is such an important principle to be valued above other human rights that it should never be surrendered easily and, if at all possible, never surrendered. It is a religious belief; a moral belief, if you like. You either take that view or you do not, in my opinion. I do take it. People who do not take it I do not think will ever be persuaded. But it is fundamental, I think, to the beliefs that have guided our civilisation and our society from the days of the Ten Commandments. It is the Judaeo&hyphen;Christian ethic, `Thou shalt not kill.' My belief is that, as a result, human life is something important and the dignity of life is to be prized highly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the principle that has spurred nearly all medical advances: the belief in the importance of life. It is the principle that has spurred humanitarian efforts. It is the principle that has seen people go into the Third World as doctors and missionaries. It has been an ennobling principle for mankind and for civilisation down through the centuries. I believe that we, as a society, need to hang on to that. If we should lose it, we should lose something very important; we should surrender, I think, one of the ennobling virtues that has contributed so much to what is good about our view of life and our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not think the Northern Territory law is going to be the end of civilisation. I do not believe that we should do other than to recognise that the legislators in the Northern Territory, according to their own powers and beliefs, acted with honesty. But I do believe that this Commonwealth parliament, being asked to intervene and having the power to do so, does have to, through its members, in an individual conscience way, take a position on that principle. It is a principle that I would not like to see surrendered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have enormous sympathy for people who are terminally ill and in deep pain. I can understand why many would take the view that bringing on death is compassionate and adds to the dignity of their death and their life. But I just think that, as a society, we have to sit back sometimes and ask ourselves, in a general way and as a general principle: will this create a better society and will this mean the surrender of something which is very dear and overwhelmingly a force for good? I think it will. And, for those reasons, with a heavy heart, I must say, I believe that this bill should be supported.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with great interest to the genuine contributions of fellow members of this House to this very important national debate on euthanasia. Mr Deputy Speaker, like many members, I have had to grapple with the very powerful arguments that underpin both sides of this issue and reconcile in my own mind the various influences that have brought me to my decision to support the Andrews bill and oppose the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conscience vote on a matter of such national and ethical importance exposes all members, and the democratic parliamentary system itself, to a breadth of argument and influences. It is against this backdrop of honest discussion and powerful argument that each <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7908"> individual parliamentarian has to grapple with responsibilities to his or her conscience, to the constituents who have passionately articulated divergent views on this issue and to the nation as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the task of establishing a personal conscience position in the face of powerful community debate has not been an easy one for any member, I am sure that, in undertaking that process, each member has benefited in personal growth terms from meeting the intellectual, political and ethical challenges presented by consideration of this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, once the ethical, political, social, moral, cultural and economic arguments have been debated and considered in good faith, the final national decision on this matter now falls on the conscience of ordinary Australians who are fortunate enough to have been elevated to high political office. This is indeed the essence of Australian democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I briefly congratulate my fellow members for the professional and sensitive manner in which this debate has been conducted. I am a little disappointed that this debate of national significance and interest has been relegated by the government to the Main Committee chamber. It is regrettable that this debate has not been given the prominence it deserves and been conducted on the floor of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I approached my decision on this important issue, like other members I have been required to acknowledge and reflect on the important influences that have shaped my own life and my response to this issue&mdash;influences such as family, religious upbringing, personal life experiences, significant others, political and philosophical perspectives and the public debate itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of us would, at most stages of our lives at least, desire to live a long, productive and healthy life. It is, however, part of the human condition that the hope I have just articulated is not&mdash;and will not&mdash;be the reality for all in the human family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a reality that many, in the closing years of their lives, will be stricken with terminal illness and disease and will be subject to personal pain and suffering that assaults with every passing breath their self-esteem and dignity. It is in this situation that the arguments for voluntary euthanasia are most powerful and persuasive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like other members of this House, I have witnessed the death of a near and dear family member in such circumstances. My mother died of a cancer of the throat and I witnessed first&hyphen;hand, in her last weeks and dying days, the awful dimensions of her suffering. That experience was a catalytic one for me personally in defining more clearly my attitude to living, as well as the process of dying. There were times in that process that my mother questioned deeply the great religious faith and the pillars of that faith on which she had constructed her own life. But despite the debilitating effects of her illness, and despite the intense pain she suffered in her final days, she died with extraordinary dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I reflect on the possibility in other circumstances of her beautiful life being terminated, I can honestly say&mdash;and I know it to be the case&mdash;that her family and friends and the dedicated medical professionals who walked with her in her final days grew immensely in a personal sense through the experience of her natural death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also had the experience of a dear, aged relative who two years ago became very ill and spent some time away from her place of residence in a nursing home in my electorate. She had lived a full life and I can recall vividly her pleas for her life to end, as she faced the prospect of never returning to the house and garden where she had lived most of her life.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7909">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I persuaded her to return to the town in which she resides and to enter an aged care facility where at least she would be accessible to her friends. She did that. Her health improved dramatically and today she is back in her own home, leading a productive and independent life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot help but reflect on the potential waste of life if the means had been available to legally terminate a life at the time she requested it in her difficult personal circumstance. While these are deeply personal experiences, they are nevertheless real and significant life situations that I personally cannot ignore in my consideration of this issue. I am an opponent of capital punishment, and I am proud of the fact that Australia has said no to death sanctioned by the state. That opposition is partly based on the awful potential for the innocent to become the victims of a tragic human mistake. I believe such potential exists in euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have read with deep concern the evidence on euthanasia in the Netherlands, where it has been reported that over 50 per cent of euthanasia is not voluntary. I am not convinced that adequate legislative safeguards could be put in place to prevent widespread abuse and, at the end of the day, prevent the death of the innocent. The proposition has been put by proponents of the Northern Territory legislation that, given the strength of public opinion support for voluntary euthanasia, members ought to base a conscience vote on this factor. Public opinion polls are notoriously open to manipulation, and I would suggest that the prime responsibility of elected representatives in matters of great moment, such as these, must be to exercise a considered judgment in good faith, not to become a slave of any media&hyphen;driven poll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, I am not convinced by legal and constitutional arguments that territorial rights are being infringed by this bill. Clearly, the Commonwealth does have the constitutional power to override the Northern Territory legislation. I note with interest the stance of the Victorian Premier who argues very strongly on this issue for the democratic rights of states and territories to legislate independently. This is an inconsistent argument coming from a public figure who, in his own state, has abolished a whole tier of local government and denied citizens their democratic right to run their own affairs. I mention this because there can be little room for hypocrisy or inconsistency in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also considered the arguments that have been raised concerning the ageing of Australia's population in the future and the pressures that this will bring to bear on the medical system to speed up the turnaround time in medical and aged care institutions. I do not accept these arguments. The notion of a civilised society is not one that rests on such economic considerations but on the fundamental values that human society articulates and legally protects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, let me thank those many constituents who have taken time to write to me and who have engaged me in patient discussion on this issue. I have appreciated your wise counsel. The fact that you have taken time to consider this issue carefully, define your own position, and communicate it to your elected representative is indeed heartening and a good indication that democratic processes are alive and well in my region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that, if the Andrews bill is carried, the government meets its national responsibility to provide more resources for quality palliative care. If this parliament does overturn the Northern Territory legislation, then there is a heavy responsibility on government to adequately resource the community to provide the alternative care and support for the dying that is implicit in the national decision.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7910">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has not been an easy journey for me, nor for other members. But I hope that, no matter what side of this issue people are on, the final decision of this parliament is accepted in the knowledge that it was made through a process of intensive discussion and analysis, and fair debate conducted in good faith by ordinary Australians. I support the Andrews bill now before the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that governments have a duty to safeguard the good of the people and promote the tranquillity and prosperity of the nation. The means by which this occurs is based on a combination of the wants of the majority of its citizens with the need to endeavour to protect the interests of all of its citizens, including those in minorities. As we know, our government has three levels attached to it: state, federal and local government. Each will make laws as it sees fit for the good of the people of its locale, state or district. But as the body of the federal legislature, we must take into consideration how this affects the nation of Australia, its citizens, and even our world neighbours who look to us with respect and admiration and count on our social stability as the bulwark of a world society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some would be surprised to see that most free democracies have their laws built around the customs and commandments of the Old Testament of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS>, given by God to his people. Perhaps it is a reflection on our standards that it behoves us all to refer back some 4,000 years to see what God instructed his children to do when we are faced with the dilemma of being guilty of mercy or murder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dangers to our society in legislation permitting such a permanent solution as death brings forth complications in ethics, both in the community and the medical profession, where the Hippocratic oath commits doctors to be the healers and never the antithesis of that. There are dangers to society in creating a society where doctors are given supreme authority over life and death, a prerogative available to relatively few law courts dealing with extreme offenders in our society as a means of punishment or deterrence for capital crimes against society. We must remember that capital punishment has been abolished in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of this new avenue, the patient may not&mdash;and I repeat, may not&mdash;be given a clear understanding that an alternative of effective painkillers is available that will allow for quality of life, in spite of a terminal state. Often extreme pain expectation is not proportionate to reality in regard to the state of suffering or discomfort that will be experienced. The next step to the terminally ill solution might be the terminally insane&mdash;and why not? Think of the savings in research and maintenance that we, as a society, must endure in solving the countless diseases of the mind and the body, when it is so much cheaper and simpler to kill off the victims. If that is acceptable, where do we draw the line then?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the ultimate form of economic rationalism. Our society recognises the right of its citizens to lead  prosperous, peaceful and happy lives and, of course, these freedoms are sacred. Our responsibility as legislators is not to allow bad laws into our system of standards and we, as legislators, must ponder carefully. Is it right to pass laws which interfere with our Maker's sole right?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel that allowing euthanasia as a legal alternative will lead to great abuses in individuals' lives, particularly where the individual is unable or incapable of understanding all the facts. I can see where relatives could have greedy or selfish considerations to put ahead of the welfare of patients and great harm and injustices may be allowed to follow under this legislation. The terminally ill, the handicapped, the frail and elderly are all people who have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7911"> the same worth and dignity as everyone else. As a responsible government we must ensure that they all have equal protection under our laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said that euthanasia is at times the kindest thing to do. I would submit that the kindest thing to do is to pay proper care and attention to those people. The world has turned to study the Northern Territory to see what happens. No other legislation has been written which gives unbridled freedom to the field of homicide by consent. Are we in Australia to have such ignoble notoriety? The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Holy </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS> teaches us that our bodies are not our own to do whatever we like with; that God created us in his image and that we are the stewards of those bodies and, as stewards, we will be given an opportunity to give account of that stewardship. Our bodies are the temples of God and therefore sacred to Him and it is not our right to destroy that which is not ours to own. In doing so, we break the fifth commandment, `Thou shall not kill.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Outspoken on this issue have been the churches, who most strongly argue that the legislative failure of euthanasia is morally wrong&mdash;something with which I personally agree. I have received many letters from all facets of the community and from the various churches encouraging this legislation that addresses the great problems with the Northern Territory legislation bill, and they go a long way in condemning it for what it is: a poorly thought out piece of legislation with too many loopholes for abuse and malfeasance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst our laws in our society are far from perfect, we will often have to judge between what is expedient and what is right. It is appropriate that this government sets aside the expedient bits, in spite of the emotional outrage based on what opponents call `inhumane suffering'. We must reject the quick solution for the right solution; one which will force us to face how to deal with the problems of the terminally ill, rather than the elimination of the terminally ill. We must do what is in our power to help the terminally ill and their relatives cope with both the natural death and the elimination of pain and suffering through the support of programs such as those in hospices and palliative care units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that, with modern palliative care techniques, pain in terminal illness is all but acquitted in 95 per cent of cases and substantially reduced in the other five per cent. I want to acknowledge here the outstanding work of the palliative care workers in my electorate with the work that they perform in areas such as Dungog, Maitland and Tomaree. Indeed, tomorrow morning I am at the launch of the Nelson Bay Polyclinic Palliative Care Inpatient Unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to address the problem with solutions; solutions that ease the pain without destroying the soul. We see that yesterday, Rod Dent, the son of the first patient to die under the Northern Territory legislation, changed his mind about supporting the bill but, unfortunately, his father Bob is not afforded that same opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been afforded a conscience vote on this bill. When we vote on it, it is something that will ride with our conscience for the rest of our lives. I will be supporting this bill and I would like to background that and relate it to my father. Emphysema is probably the longest, hardest death to deal with because in its initial stages it is not full of pain but it is slow strangulation. We lived with that for 15 years before his death. My father was a very ill man and we watched his life come to an end. My mother is now going through the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had been in a coma for his last weeks but on the day before he died, he suddenly came good. He sat up, and we spoke and we shared memories. We talked about things. If euthanasia had been available, and taken as the easy option when the coma first happened, I would never <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7912"> have experienced that day. That day is something that I will treasure for the rest of my life and it is something that I cannot ever allow to happen to somebody else: to miss out on that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not in favour of euthanasia but I am opposed to the Euthanasia Laws Bill. The bill sponsored by the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) proposes to overturn the Northern Territory law which allows for euthanasia in limited circumstances. It also proposes to remove from the ACT and Norfolk Island territories the power to make similar laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory law has been validly passed by the Northern Territory Assembly under the constitution conferred on it by the federal parliament's Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 and was given assent by the Governor&hyphen;General. While the self&hyphen;government act allows for federal intervention, the then federal Labor government did not exercise this option at the time the Northern Territory bill was enacted in 1995. In my view, the time for such action has now expired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My objection to euthanasia, as it is proposed, is an on&hyphen;balance judgment. Like many, I have had the experience of a close member of the family suffering the pain of a slow death. These are difficult times for all involved. I do not believe, however, that we should endorse euthanasia. Our society, based on Christian traditions and principles, places the highest value on human life and the innate dignity of the individual. It is not for parliaments to sanction the taking of life by euthanasia. For the same reason, I do not support capital punishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Christian churches have rightly been taking the lead in expressing opposition to euthanasia. Church leaders have made many public statements on the issue but the words which I feel certainly reflect my own views are those of the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, Harry Goodhew. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an alternative to euthanasia. It is to value each life, to build the kind of society that upholds the dignity of the poor, sick, frail, aged, very young and disabled. To embrace them as significant members of our community and work to enrich their lives.</PARA>

<PARA>Nevertheless, I must say that there is some support in some sections of the community for euthanasia, and the Northern Territory initiative is an obvious illustration of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that some say the euthanasia debate is of national importance and that this justifies Commonwealth intervention. It is said that any Australian could move to the Territory to avail themselves of this law. This is true, but it is equally true of many other laws for which the states and territories have legislative responsibility. When former Queensland premier Sir Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen abolished probate duty, his action had a national impact. Some Australians obviously did move to Queensland to avoid probate duty. However, this did not give rise to a new constitutional power in the Commonwealth over probate duty. Abortion is also an important issue; so is the debate about the ethics of in&hyphen;vitro fertilisation. Generally speaking, these issues are the responsibility of the states and territories and, in my view, they should remain so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years, I have developed my views about the role of government. There is a balance to be found between the proper role of government, underpinned by the mandate of the majority, and the rights of the individual. Whilst the views of the majority prevail to underpin our system of governance, the success of our society rests on the special emphasis we accord to the rights of the individual. These rights are given force and effect in many ways; for example, through the independence of our judicial system, by specific legislation, through the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7913"> welfare system for the disadvantaged and through the many institutions, such as the press and the ombudsman, that each play a role in protecting these rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our society, in the last 100 years or so, governments have had an ever greater influence in and over the lives of individuals. Much of this is justified by the greater complexity of today's society, the rise of nation states, and the demands of individuals for the provision by states of education, health, welfare and controls over our environment. None of this do I regret. My concern, however, is that to preserve the rights of the individual we must forever be vigilant to guard against the unnecessary expansion of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a new issue in Australia or in the other Western democracies. In drafting the Australian constitution, the founding fathers were at pains to control the power and reach of government by imposing constraints. For this reason in Australia we have within government, in its widest meaning, a separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. And even within these elements power is devolved and constrained, for example, by a system of appeals within our judicial system and by the bicameral system within the parliament itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more importantly, Australia's founding fathers adopted a federal structure to devolve and separate the powers of government. It is a system that has worked well. There is no greater fallacy than the statement that the defenders of a federal system make a choice in favour of states rights over human rights when they argue for the continuation of the federal system. Our federal system is one of the great guarantees of individual human rights. To me, this is not an issue of states rights, but the right of self&hyphen;government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am unashamedly a supporter of the federal system, not because I have a blind faith in the rights of states or the capacity of state parliaments to make good decisions, but because I am a supporter of a system of devolved political power. I think our system should be devolved further. I have argued this case consistently for many years. In our democracy, our citizens have increasingly felt isolated, detached and, thus, cynical about politics. In the past I have canvassed an antidote for this growing disillusionment about our political system. I have argued for a system which encourages greater participation by citizens through referenda in the democratic process. For me to support this bill and vote for federal intervention would be tantamount to abandoning my views and it would be hypocritical of me to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all these reasons I support statehood, as a matter of principal, for the Northern Territory. The proponents of this bill justify Commonwealth intervention on the ground that the issue is of national importance. It is claimed that this issue goes to our sense of a unifying national identity. My view is different; I see the national identity encompassing free people being able, within regional political systems, to determine these issues themselves. By virtue of the self&hyphen;government acts which govern the territories, the ACT, Norfolk Island and the Northern Territory are all jurisdictions similar to the six states. Yet all of the states have the power, and will retain the power, to legislate on the issue of euthanasia, but if this legislation is passed the three jurisdictions in question will lose this power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should an Australian on the Queensland side of the border live within a political jurisdiction that has the power to legislate on certain issues, and another Australian, on the Northern Territory side of the border, not have that power? Northern Territorians will not be able to live with the certainty that their democratically elected representatives will be able to enact legislation as elected representatives in all other states are able to do. By passing this legislation, we will place some Australians on a different footing from other Australians.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7914">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept that some issues are too important to be decided by local people, through their local parliament, is a common view in Canberra, but it is wrong. Territory politicians representing territory citizens are just as capable of determining important conscience issues as federal politicians. I do not place the importance or value of my conscience over that of a parliamentary colleague in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly understand the invidious position in which the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory finds himself. As I understand it, he is personally opposed to the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act and actively campaigned against it when it was first proposed in the territory. However, now as Chief Minister he has been placed in a position where he must enact the will of the parliamentary representatives who were democratically elected by the people of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, let me say, in my capacity as Leader of the House, that in the normal course of events private members' bills are rarely allowed the time to be debated. The Howard government has ensured that this issue is fully debated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that there has been some debate about the venue for the second reading debate, noting that all the votes will be taken, however, in the chamber. The reality is that in order to fulfil its commitments to the Australian people, the Howard government is obliged to give priority in the chamber to the budget, budget-related matters and the other bills that implement our election promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Main Committee, which was established with our support by the previous Labor government, is an integral part of the federal legislative process and the current debate on an extremely important issue is an endorsement of the Main Committee's status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final comment on this issue is to simply note in passing that since the introduction of the euthanasia bill on 9 September, there have been six days on which private members business has been conducted in the chamber, and there appears to have been no suggestion that any of that time be set aside to debate this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there has been vigorous debate about this venue, at least in Australia, unlike in the United States where this issue is about to be canvassed in the Supreme Court, we have been able to calmly debate and resolve the issues in the parliament in the best tradition of our democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In accord with that tradition and in accord with my view, which is that we ought to support a devolved political system in this country, whilst it was appropriate for this matter to be debated in the national parliament, ultimately I believe that the responsibility for the issue rests with those elected in the Northern Territory to exercise their conscience as duly elected representatives of the Northern Territory assembly. On that basis, whilst I am not in favour of euthanasia, I will, however, be opposing this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the brief time allotted to me I wish to add my voice in support of Kevin Andrews' private member's bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many important aspects of this debate, which time will not permit me to address this morning. These include the real anguish of unrelenting pain and suffering in a terminally ill patient; the concern that we all share for the infirm, the elderly and the severely disabled; the almost five per cent of those who are terminally ill who are reported to have requested death; the depression which is known to accompany terminal illness; the urgent necessity for increased funding for comprehensive palliative care in all Australian states and territories; the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7915"> excellent Victorian palliative care model and the loving support given by the home hospice program; the realpolitik of hard-core economic imperatives which dictate government decision making; the so&hyphen;called states rights issues; the question of whether or not this legislation is good law or bad law; the very real threat of abuse of this legislation; and, of course, the real core issue in the whole debate, the threat to the fundamental keystone of our society, which is the intrinsic value we place on human life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would need much more than my 10 minutes, but since such issues have been addressed before at some length, I wish to focus on what I see to be the core issue, and that is the protection and preservation of human life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My friend and colleague, the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), has written a letter to me and stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The debate is not about the need for federal parliament to legislate in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to my friend that I believe that this is a matter of great national interest. I say that it is an extreme abuse of sovereignty for a state or territory to make laws which will evolve to undermine the basic human rights of its people. The people of the Northern Territory need care, not death by administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a society have never rendered to the idea that disposability is part of the human condition. Mr Rod Dent, the son of the first person to have been dispatched by this legislation, said only last week, `I believe you cannot put in place laws for euthanasia where you do not have a decent palliative care system.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue is of such national relevance, I firmly believe it would be an abrogation of our responsibility if it were not debated here in the parliament of the nation. However, we risk trivialising this important debate if we see the issue as confined by the narrow terms of states rights, or whether or not the law is good or bad when interpreted by the proponents of black&hyphen;letter law. And, make no mistake, the debate is not about life and death either; it is just about death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not about a person being able to have the choice of when they wish to die. It is about the legally sanctioned administration of death upon one human being by another, and the ultimate prospect that it will be so administered without any choice at all upon any of us. It is about the ultimate violation of the fundamental paradigm upon which our society is structured. It is about the corrosion of our own humanity. It is about the erosion of the belief that human life, its veneration, protection and preservation, is the keystone of the good governance of our society and the good ordering of human relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The good ordering of human relationships is based upon an expansive compassion for all human beings: the young and the healthy, the aged and the frail, the disabled and those with special needs of all kinds. The good ordering of human relationships includes a respectful regard for the whole person, recognising the intrinsic value and special worth of each individual at all times, in all the ages and faces which complete that wonderful cycle of the human experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From this fundamental principle of the intrinsic value of each and every human being we have derived our sense of human rights. It is the basis upon which our laws are predicated, from whence we receive our ideals of social justice and personal freedom, and the ideas of equality and fraternity. It is found in the personal respect we offer to our fellow human beings, and thereby find our own concept of self and our own sense of identity. It is part of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7916"> essence of humanness, part of the connectedness that each human being has with all other members of the human race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the quintessential spirit of Anzac, the heroic ethic of legendary mateship that marks the Australian psyche, distilled in acts of valour and pulsing courage and bursting heart, and remembered in silent awe by the rest of us. It is ever present in the immense value that we as a nation place on each human life and can be seen in our total rejection of capital punishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received many letters from people, both inside and outside my electorate, who are all very concerned about this issue one way or another. Those who write in support of the Northern Territory legislation use words like `choice' and `control', and it seems to me that one of their greatest fears is that, in the unknown experience of dying, they will not be able to exercise the control over their lives which they presently enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We live in a high&hyphen;tech age&mdash;an age of press&hyphen;button control over just about all aspects of our daily living, from education, communication, entertainment and learning to cooking and washing, and even turning on the light. Death alone remains uncontrollable, and it is the last unknown frontier. To the rational modern mind, to be able to have control to choose the time of our own deaths appears to be a logical step. But we should not be too ready to be beguiled by technology and rational solutions for our own private fears. The danger is too great, and that danger is not only that this legislation will devalue and undermine the intrinsic value that we place on human life, but the very danger of evolving a death dealing culture through the abuse of this legislation is all too real. Such a culture will eventually undermine the humanity in all of us, thus threatening the foundations of society as we know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And when such a culture develops, the legislation which allows for human beings to be dispatched by another as a process of administrative homicide will, like all other legislation, certainly be abused. As a lawyer, I am well aware that legislation is often abused. But the abuse of this legislation is murder. The experience of the Netherlands, which has already been well documented in this House, clearly shows that, in spite of every possible safeguard, in a one&hyphen;year period, 55 per cent of deaths by so&hyphen;called euthanasia were carried out without the consent of the person so euthanised. In other words, these people were executed. In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords select committee investigating voluntary euthanasia finally rejected it on the grounds that it was impossible to guarantee that it would not be abused, and that the required voluntary aspect could not be ensured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with this very real knowledge that every other law that has ever been written has been abused to a greater or lesser extent that persuades me of the real dangers of this corrosive law and the abuse that will surely follow. A culture of death will evolve and it will be based on sound rational principles, and the deserving will be the independent, the healthy and the productive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fear this legislation will engender the formation of a social definition of the quality of life, and, since social definitions generally reflect the imperatives of society, any argument that the legislation would afford the individual a purely personal objective is destroyed. I believe that the individual will have the general social imperative imposed upon him or her rather than exercise any free choice in the matter. Then, of course, the economic rational argument will follow as an example of social imperative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Father Christopher Toohey, the director of the Sydney archdiocese office, wrote in his letter to me of 2 November this year:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7917">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Persons who cannot `fit' the rationalist criterion for living as whole productive autonomous members of our society will be at most risk. Their vulnerability will be compounded by the fact that having imbibed the culture's core attitudes and values of `disposability,' they themselves will feel coercion, even moral obligation&mdash;albeit distorted&mdash;to relinquish their right to live and to engage another, who will perhaps be motivated by duty, in the process of their termination. If such a culture develops, it will mean that we Australians have abrogated the very heart of our own national sense of self.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not put it better than Mr Toohey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are really on dangerous ground here. This corrosive legislation threatens us all individually, as a society and as a nation, and there are those amongst us who already express these sentiments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the speech of one of our leading identities, the then Governor&hyphen;General, Mr Bill Hayden, on 21 June 1995, in which an extreme economic logic found a most disturbing expression. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a point when the succeeding generations deserve to be disencumbered of some unproductive burdens.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that if you only see the unproductive burden, if we can only define our fellow citizens by their quality of life, if we fail to see the human being within, then we are already very close to the culture of death. From there, where do we go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only have to look at nations where there is no respect for human life, no laws, no order, no social or stable relationships. We only have to look at Rwanda and Zaire, and other African nations where ancient tribal brutality is but the most violent physical expression of the absence of any respect for human life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Oh no,' you say, `it could never happen here. We are not Rwanda. We are Australia. We are a rich and wealthy nation. We are the lucky country and, anyway, we do not have such historical tribal antagonisms.' True; but the culture of death will evolve just the same, if not in the same manifestation. There will be no blood and bodies in our rivers or on our streets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our high&hyphen;tech sophistication, we can be assured that subtlety and clinical discretion will prevail. The abuse of this kind of legislation will see that the culture of death will be there all the same. The act of lawful killing will eventually corrode the prohibition against killing that is the foundation of good order in our Australian society. We will all be diminished by the devaluation of human life. None of us are islands. We are all connected in our humanness. But John Donne says it better than I:</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.48 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the Kevin Andrews Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. I do so knowing that I especially have a very serious and solemn responsibility, not only to all of the members of the electorate of Makin, but also to every person in Australia. I have, over the past few months, endeavoured to canvass the concerns of as many constituents in my electorate as possible with regard to the Kevin Andrews bill and, surprisingly, the results were roughly fifty&hyphen;fifty, rather than the 70 to 80 per cent support for euthanasia that is seen in some surveys.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that this is a territory or states rights issue. The issue we are debating in this instance is the legalisation of euthanasia. Whichever way you want to put it, legalised euthanasia is state sanctioned assistance by a person to cause the death of another, or the state <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7918"> sanctioned killing of another person. The main argument for that premise is to be able to die with dignity and freedom from pain and suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important dilemma that arises from the issues relating to the euthanasia debate is: what sort of society do we want for ourselves in 30 or so years time? As I see it, the consequences of decisions we make today will not necessarily be felt immediately, or within a week, months or a few years, but rather within a generational time span.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as being a parent to three boys before entering parliament, I had the honour of being a nurse over the past 15 years in the area of aged care, incorporating nursing home, palliative and hostel care. I did not feel that I was wasting my time in caring for our elderly who were in need of nursing care. I felt that I had a valuable contribution to make in assisting our elderly and those with terminal illnesses to live their passing years or months with dignity, comfort and to be as free from pain and suffering as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people may share the view of the former Governor&hyphen;General, Mr Bill Hayden, who when speaking to the Royal Australian College of Physicians stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a point when the succeeding generations deserve to be disencumbered of some unproductive burdens.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have to say that I have never felt that any of the residents I have nursed were `unproductive burdens'. The residents were not considered by nursing colleagues, the management team, domestic staff, nor the volunteers in my former place of employment to be `unproductive burdens'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do live in a pluralist and increasingly secular and hedonistic society, with many individuals holding differing personal points of view, demanding more autonomy and rights to self&hyphen;interest, perhaps at the expense of others or regardless of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members of parliament, we have a responsibility and duty to protect and legislate for the vulnerable, the elderly, the disabled and the sick and not to disencumber our society of `unproductive burdens' because they are perceived to be inconvenient, hard work, or of nuisance value. For how far do we go with euthanasia if the Northern Territory laws were allowed to stand 30 years hence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask the question for a person born in the year 1996, living with a new set of societal mores and a new community value system created by the euthanasia legislation. If that person chose to be a nurse in the area of aged care, would they ever be taught palliative care techniques, respect, care and dignity for those in need of that care? Or would the majority of our new generations of nurses in aged care, 30 years hence, be taught solely the best practice of cleaning and sterilising computer keyboards, explanatory techniques on how best to, and in which position to, press particular buttons and, following that, procedures on how best to dispose of the body for burial or cremation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who support euthanasia may feel that this situation could never occur, and that perhaps I am being unrealistic, but we are all human and human nature means that there can never be 100 per cent safeguards in relation to the abuse of laws governing euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a nurse experienced in the area of aged care, I feel that I can speak with some authority on the possible ramifications of the Northern Territory legislation in relation to ruthless relatives, potential benefactors, unscrupulous providers of aged care and the insidious push for the non&hyphen;utilisation of expensive medical resources for those who some in our society would say do not really deserve them nor should have access to them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7919">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, before I speak on those issues, I would like to discuss the Remmelink report examining voluntary euthanasia in the Netherlands. It was discovered that, out of approximately 25,000 people euthanased, approximately 14,000 of those were euthanased without the consent of either themselves, their family or a person appointed to make those decisions. The situation in the Netherlands has deteriorated to the point of complete disregard for the law, whereby doctors giving evidence were not arguing whether or not they had euthanased, that is, murdered or killed elderly patients without their or their family's consent, but they were arguing about the actual number they had killed&mdash;whether it was 600 or 1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also found through surveys and anecdotal evidence that elderly people were too frightened to visit their general practitioner in case they were found to be burdensome or too old and that the ultimate treatment for their ailment were recommended&mdash;euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the reality today in the Netherlands. In fact, the argument is now being pushed to include the disabled as well as deformed babies and other so&hyphen;called unproductive citizens. Hitler would have been proud, although Hitler and, we thought, his ideals, died a long time ago. The `brave new world' is already here in the Netherlands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of my colleagues on both sides of the argument have stated they have been with a relative, a loved one or, in some cases, a patient who was dying of a terminal illness and that it was hard to witness the pain and suffering they went through. Not only did I look after my own mother, who died of inoperable cancer in 1984 when palliative care was not widely practised, but I have witnessed many deaths while nursing in the area of aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who have not experienced the following situation, I will say a few words on ruthless relatives. Whilst I was on evening shift, the dying resident I was caring for was visited by her son&hyphen;in&hyphen;law's brother and his wife at around 10.30 p.m. The resident was expected to pass away within 24 hours or so. The woman approached me as I was going about my duty and asked would I mind, as this poor lady was going to die at any moment, removing her wedding ring and very valuable antique engagement ring from her fingers because she had not been able to manage it; that when the resident's daughter came to visit the following day she would be able to get the rings and that would not be fair. The visitor really wanted them because `they were really nice and no&hyphen;one would miss the rings anyway' because the resident in question had so much money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My response to the woman's request was to tell her that it was an inappropriate request, that I had no authority to remove any valuables from the room, let alone rings from the dying woman's fingers, and had to ask them to leave, reporting the incident to the duty sister&hyphen;in&hyphen;charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is just a single example&mdash;although in the minority&mdash;of how, sadly, some relatives of aging residents attempt to take advantage of and exploit the residents' goodwill, stripping their homes of valuables, furniture and bank accounts in their misguided perceptions of fairness, justice and their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If euthanasia had been legalised some years ago, I have no doubt that I would not have had the opportunity to have met many of the residents I had the pleasure to care for. Their families would have disposed of these so&hyphen;called unproductive burdens long ago. At the other end of the scale, there are residents who, because they do require assistance in care, feel as though they are a burden on the nurses, their families and their doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent arguments in relation to the euthanasia debate have included the problematic question of residents with dementia. The reality of looking after residents with dementia is that it is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7920"> a much more difficult and often thankless, emotionally exhausting task. However, surely, as members of parliament, we have the responsibility of fostering and promoting the community values of mutual support and caring and good management of illnesses rather than promoting the concept that human life is disposable because of economic, productive, burdensome or autonomy reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also argue that, as a society, we should be working harder to ensure that those with a terminal illness have the necessary support systems and access to palliative care to allow them to live their last moments with dignity and comfort, without pain and suffering. As to the argument for relief of pain and suffering as the main reason for the introduction of the euthanasia bill into the Northern Territory legislation, according to Dr John Zalizberg, `The Northern Territory has no medical oncologist, virtually no radiotherapy services, not a single palliative care specialist, a barely resourced domiciliary palliative care program and not a single hospice.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I humbly suggest, and commend to all members of parliament, both state and federal, that it would be advantageous to examine the South Australian select committee report on the law and practice relating to death and dying, 1992. I believe that the South Australian Consent to Medical Treatment and Palliative Care Act 1995, is the most practical and sensible act in relation to the questions of death and dying. The act allows for the provision of a living will, the right to refuse extraordinary and cumbersome treatments to prolong life unnecessarily. The emphasis on the intent of the utilisation of pain relieving drugs is most relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not go down the path of the brave new world; rather let us, as parliamentarians, fight for access to effective palliative care and dignity in life. We should aim to remove the pain and suffering of the terminal illness, not remove the patient. I support the Kevin Andrews bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is no longer illegal in the Northern Territory, which only repealed its law this year. Suicide is one thing, but killing, even consensual killing, is an entirely different thing again. Medical execution is no more acceptable than judicial execution: allowing someone else to administer a lethal injection is no more acceptable than allowing someone else to administer a fatal revolver shot.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the right to die is not the same as the right to kill or be killed. States rights, such as they are, can never be at odds with human rights. Human rights are always more important than state or institutional rights. Human rights are in some sense absolute, whereas institutional rights are more matters of administrative convenience or practical efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of this debate, a number of speakers have said that they are opposed to euthanasia but they support the Northern Territory's right to make law. That is a version of Voltaire, saying, `I oppose what you do but I defend your right to do it.' If someone has the power to stop something and refuses to exercise it, that person is complicit in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not something that this parliament has no power to stop. Let us be very clear about this. This national parliament has the right to stop the Northern Territory's euthanasia program. This is not an area where misguided policy can be tolerated in the cause of social harmony or in the interests of proper give and take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a state tried to re&hyphen;introduce capital punishment, this parliament, quite rightly and properly, would try to intervene. If a state tried to introduce a system of apartheid, this parliament, very properly, would try to intervene. If a local council tried to introduce confiscatory fines for breaches of trivial ordinances, this parliament or other parliaments would try to intervene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do intervene constantly in environmental, industrial and economic matters. These are comparatively small things. If it is right to intervene in those things, surely it is right and proper to intervene in the most important question of all&mdash;the question of life and death. If this parliament cannot decide these matters, what is the point of having a national parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I deeply respect my friend and colleague the member for Flinders (Mr Reith). I deeply respect his views on the desirability of the devolution of powers but, with respect to those views, I do not detect any move to hand industrial relations back to the states. `None of my business' is a terrible cop&hyphen;out. It is a terrible cop&hyphen;out, and it is not something that should ever be heard here in the national parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard lots of people in the course of this debate telling us that euthanasia happens anyway. I think it is important for those people to ask themselves these questions. Is legalising it going to make the practice more or less widespread? Is legalising euthanasia going to make the very old and the very sick feel more or less vulnerable?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the deepest anxiety for the old and the weak is worrying about being a burden. I know it, because every time I see my grandmother, she frets about this very problem. But if euthanasia were to become legal, what additional, self&hyphen;generated pressure might these people be under&mdash;let alone the pressure from relatives eager for a quick inheritance, let alone the pressure from medical administrators anxious to have another empty hospital bed? Euthanasia, it seems to me, is the ultimate form of economic rationalism&mdash;the ultimate statement that everything has its price, even human life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consider the case of a comatose patient lying in a hospital bed, with little hope of recovery, every day a burden on his or her family, every day a burden on the taxpayer. Of course it would be easier to give such a person one cheap, final injection, rather than to give him or her an endless series of expensive injections. It would be much easier, but it would not be right because convenience never justifies acts as grave as this.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7922">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is always easier to get rid of our problems rather than to live with them but, in the course of trying to do this in the Northern Territory, we risk turning human beings into disposable items and turning human life into a plastic, throwaway commodity. Compared to the holocaust and to the killing fields, what is happening in the Northern Territory at the moment is, perhaps, a very small outrage. We could not stop those other things. We can stop this. We must stop it. We cannot allow it to happen here in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his speech to the parliament opening the case for opposition to the Euthanasia Laws Bill, the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) set out a challenge to those of us who support it. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I invite anyone to mount a plausible argument that patients should not determine their course of treatment, whatever its form.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an invitation I now propose to accept. I intend to do so by a refutation of the four principal arguments advanced by the supporters of euthanasia, with special reference to the propositions advanced by two of the principal opponents of this bill, my colleagues the member for Grayndler and the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those propositions are: first, that the bill represents an illegitimate exercise of power by the Commonwealth; second, that the majority of people want euthanasia; third, that the bill involves the imposition of values by one group of people over another; and, fourth, that the bill denies individual rights and autonomy. In relation to the first argument, my colleague the member for Hindmarsh asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What right have we as a democratically elected parliament to overturn the properly enacted legislation of another legitimate and democratically elected parliament?</PARA>
<PARA>I share the view of the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) that this is in fact the weakest of all arguments advanced against the bill. It is, in the words of the previous speaker, the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), a cop&hyphen;out. The answer to the member's question is simple and I propose to deal with it in one sentence. This bill involves an entirely orthodox exercise of a specific Commonwealth power under section 122 of the Australian constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second argument advanced against the bill is that the majority of Australians want euthanasia. As a person with a great respect for the democratic process, and as someone who recognises that it is based upon a great sensitivity and concern for the will of the people, this is an argument which carries some force with me. I have received approximately 100 letters from my constituents on the subject of euthanasia of which about 90 have been supportive of the Andrews bill. I nonetheless accept that a majority of Australians, when polled in public opinion polls, would support euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To oppose the will of the majority under these circumstances is said to be a symptom of arrogance. That, in my view, reflects a misconception about the role of the legislator and the duty of a parliamentarian in a representative democracy. The question of one's obligations to advance and reflect the views of one's constituents, as opposed to one's conscience, was addressed by Edmund Burke in a speech to the electors of Bristol, on his election to the House of Commons in 1774. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly, Gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinions, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7923">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgement, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure&mdash;no, nor from the law and the Constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgement; and he betrays instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.</PARA>
<PARA>Ours is not a direct democracy, such as that practised in the Swiss cantons, but a representative democracy, with members drawn from 148 electorates and six states and two territories. We are answerable to our constituents at each election but also to our conscience each day. While we respect and revere the individual wishes of our constituents, we are bound to exercise our judgment, flawed as it may be, to govern in the interests of the community as a whole. So there are circumstances in which it is not only allowable but indeed one's duty to oppose the majority, and I will now defend my decision to do so on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second objection to the bill expressed by my colleague, the member for Hindmarsh, is that it imposes the belief system of one group of people on another. This proposition is based on either considerable naivety or deliberate duplicity about the manner in which legislation operates. It suggests that it is possible, indeed desirable, to create legislation which is value free, which somehow can be evacuated of moral content. That is not my understanding of the way in which legislation works. Every piece of legislation passed by any parliament anywhere in the world involves value judgments and their compulsory enforcement by a legal instrument. That is the nature of legislation and, indeed, of decisions of courts throughout the land. Our task is not to somehow evacuate the law of moral content; our task is to ensure, according to the lights which guide each one of us, that the moral content in every law is worth enforcing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A third argument advanced against this bill is that it denies individual rights. I accept that that is the case and that, in fact, the passage of every piece of legislation involves the circumscription of individual rights to some extent. The question is whether the sacrifice of individual freedom in these circumstances is required to achieve a greater social or communal objective, because the reality is that individual rights do not exist in a vacuum. They are given by a community, by a society, and if we erode the values which hold the society together then the very concept of individual dignity loses all meaning. Dignity is itself an inherently communal concept. There is no sense in which dignity can operate in isolation, so we have got to preserve the values which uphold community and society while, at the same time, exercising concern for the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An opponent of this bill, the member for Grayndler, made this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opponents of voluntary euthanasia should not see it as a threat to their rights. Indeed this act has no application to them.</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the Northern Territory act. I find that an extraordinary statement&mdash;the idea that a piece of legislation can be applied merely to those who fall directly within its purview, that it merely regulates a technical exercise of behaviour by specified individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that legislation on statute books around the country involves a snapshot of the values of the culture as a whole. The idea that we can somehow isolate ourselves or make ourselves immune from the influence of those values is, in my view, quite preposterous. So I entirely concur with the member for Melbourne, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think this fits in with a pattern that is extending right across our whole polity, right across many decisions to reduce people to atoms, to individuals, to take decisions that are not based on the society as a whole. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7924">  </PARA>
<PARA>I listened yesterday with interest to the speech of my colleague the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) when he quoted the great English poet John Donne, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</PARA>
<PARA>This vision of connectedness, of community, of each belonging to the other is, in my view, the very heartbeat of what we are seeking to encourage as national leaders. It goes to the core of what civil society is all about. It is a foundation stone of every great ethical and legal code known to man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is reflected in the decision of Donoghue v. Stephenson, perhaps the most influential common law judgment of modern times, in which Lord Atkin articulated what has become known as the neighbour principle. He was drawing upon the remarks of a Jewish carpenter in northern Palestine about 20 centuries ago who was asked, `What is the greatest commandment in the law?' To this he responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the law and the prophets can be summarised in this one command&mdash;love your neighbour as yourself.</PARA>
<PARA>The erosion of those values is reflected in some comments made during the debate. It was suggested, for example, by the member for Hindmarsh that doctors are killing their patients and that this is done without regulation and without due process. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any country which respects law cannot allow killing to go on unsupervised.</PARA>
<PARA>And the member for Grayndler said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sometimes if a doctor cannot or will not assist this situation gives rise to clumsy and tragic suicide attempts.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The message to the Australian people is that if we are going to kill each other, let's do it according to the book; if we are going to kill each other, let's do it with efficiency. I find it somewhat ironic that that is coming from the member for Grayndler, who criticises the government on the basis of its preoccupation with efficiency. This argument is not about efficiency; it is about human life. We have got to uphold life. I support this bill and urge other honourable members to do the same.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is little doubt in my mind that this debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill is a defining moment in our moral and social history. In fact, the implications go well beyond Canberra in 1996; they go out to the wider international community. We are being asked whether or not we sanction the taking of a life of one individual by another. We can dress up this issue in soft and soothing images; we can even attach it to a computer. But, inevitably, we are led to the inexorable, unavoidable reality that one human actively kills another. Call it euthanasia, suicide, assisted suicide or mercy killing, the intent and the results are still the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You must then ask yourself these questions. Is this consistent with human development over the last three or four millennia? Is it consistent with the rule of law that we have developed in our system over the last 900 years or so? Is it consistent with the development of ethics? Is it consistent with the mores of the Judaeo&hyphen;Christian tradition? Clearly, it is not. Let me clearly state that I am not judgmental, nor do I have any right to be judgmental of those who in good conscience subscribe to the concept of euthanasia, nor of those who in good conscience have chosen euthanasia or assisted in euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It genuinely hurts and grieves me to be at odds with my colleagues in the Northern Territory. I wish it were otherwise. But I must observe that I find it a great irony that such a young, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7925"> vibrant, enthusiastic territory&mdash;indeed, one which is full of life&mdash;would be the first in the civilised world to legalise the taking of life by another. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> put it in its 28 June editorial:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Territory Government is now characterising this opposition as a fight over state rights. This is a great pity. Having forced the rest of the nation to think about this sensitive social issue, it cannot be surprised if the debate has spread beyond its borders.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, section 122 of our constitution gives the right to this parliament and that right must be exercised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As colonies have developed, whether they have been British, French, Spanish or Portuguese, they have had various levels of social development that have taken them from colonies to dependencies, dominions, self&hyphen;governing dominions and countries. Papua New Guinea has gone through that process with Australia and so has the Northern Territory. For that reason, it is not conscionable for the federal government to duck this issue. This is one of our great defining moments and the federal government should be speaking about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it goes beyond states rights. It is literally the ultimate life and death issue. If this form of death is approved there is no knowing the ultimate end of many variations that might follow it. In the 20th century we have lived in an age of experimentation and testing the limits. We have developed nuclear science to the point where we could have almost annihilated the human race. We have developed explosive devices capable of extraordinary violence. We have made chemicals capable of unimaginable devastation. Please God, many of these evils are back in their bottles, never to be released. Indeed, as individuals we are somewhat powerless to directly influence the course of their development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But here today, with all our frailties and anxieties, we are capable of influencing this step towards a new dark age where life will become a currency to be haggled over, traded and devalued. Dare I say that some of us will become like the old one&hyphen; and two&hyphen;cent coins&mdash;humble, insignificant, perceived to be valueless&mdash;and taken out of circulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any reading of Australian history carries with it an insight into our capacity for endurance beyond unimagined odds. Whether it was the new colony on the edge of starvation in the 1780s, or Burke and Wills, or a plethora of other explorers, or goldminers and diggers, or pioneers, life was on the edge on many occasions. But it was still held to be sacred, inviolate and to be preserved at all cost. In the prisoner of war camps of the Second World War, men were subjected to unimaginable cruelty, brutality, starvation and deprivation, and yet in that pit, that morass of hopelessness, there was a common thread of defiance, endurance and caring for human life exhibited. From the Weary Dunlops through to the humblest privates, it is etched in our national character. It distinguishes us from all other nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our respect for life extends to the opposition to capital punishment. We recoil from execution, some of us on humanitarian grounds, some because we will not allow the remotest possibility that an innocent life should be taken. Against this background, I see euthanasia as totally inconsistent with our national character and national mores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me be quite clear on what I do not see as euthanasia. It is not the turning off of a life support machine for the brain dead, or the compliance with the wishes of a patient that excessive, onerous and intrusive mechanisms be not kept on. Surely, such people have the right to have them turned off and let nature take its course. Nor is it the administration of pain killing drugs where the unintended consequence may be the hastening of death. I see none <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7926"> of those as euthanasia. I see euthanasia as the active participation of one person, by injection or some other means, in taking another's life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is not only with what purports to be the strict controls in this Northern Territory legislation, but what might happen a little further down the track. I do not want to introduce abortion to this debate, nor shall I. But I do want to draw one parallel, and that is this: once abortion in some form was approved in one state, from that day to this the boundaries have been progressively pushed out until we have one so&hyphen;called eminent ethicist who believes that it is tolerable for parents to snuff out the lives of their babies in the early weeks of life. That is the extremity to which that debate was pushed. There is no doubt in my mind that the extremities of this debate, if approved, would be pushed out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Herron told a very interesting story in a speech he gave about an 89&hyphen;year&hyphen;old woman who was vomiting blood from a stomach ulcer. She was in imminent danger of death but she recoiled from the thought of an operation. She asked John Herron to ring her daughter. He rang the daughter and the daughter said that her mother was declining and he should let her die in peace. The woman's condition became critical. John rang her again, asking, `What do you think?' She repeated the advice, saying, `Let her die in peace.' However, the patient then decided to go ahead with the operation. She left hospital five days later a healthy and fit person. But the aftermath of this story is more chilling that the actual medical side of it. The medical side proves quite conclusively that not all people who are in danger of death should necessarily be shut down. Quite the contrary. What he found out later was&mdash;and this was on Mothers Day and all, would you believe&mdash;that the mother and daughter were estranged. The daughter was heavily in debt and the mother had a very large estate. And those are the sorts of circumstances where the boundaries would be pushed and the rationale for recommending death would be tested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take you a little further. I can see a circumstance where there would not be two doctors and a psychiatrist looking after every case. Some states would say that that was unnecessary, that they did not have enough psychiatrists, or that it militated against country people. What then would happen to Mary McGinty, in bed 30 of a 30&hyphen;bed ward, who had no family, where the bed was wanted, where she had no quality of life, where her carer decided that it was about time she went, and two compliant young house doctors agreed with her. Poor old Mary McGinty's life would be worth nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many in this debate have quoted John Donne's famous lines:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No man is an Island . . . Any man's death diminishes me . . . it tolls for thee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the euthanasia debate, brought on by the Kevin Andrews private member's bill. From the outset, I must say that I have given this bill, the Euthanasia Laws Bill, a very detailed consideration on obviously what is fundamentally a life and death issue. The decision that I have arrived at has not been made in haste, nor do I wish to pass judgment on those who, with great passion, have advocated euthanasia. On this note, I do have great empathy with the predicament that my Northern Territory colleagues find themselves in&mdash;notably, Nick Dondas and Grant Tambling&mdash;regarding the support for the Northern Territory's right of the terminally ill legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7927">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to define, though, what the true definition of euthanasia is, and to acknowledge the distinction between passive and active euthanasia. Generally speaking, euthanasia is the intentional taking of a person's life for compassionate motives when the person requests it. It is the administration of a lethal injection which terminates life. This is distinct from passive euthanasia, which is the removal of a life support system, or the withdrawal of a medical treatment which is necessary to support life. One is the actual killing of life; the other is letting nature take its course. The Northern Territory's legislation, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act&mdash;whilst in theory it sounds plausible and, to be fair, there are numerous checks and balances&mdash;cannot be condoned because the risks are too great. I will demonstrate that history has proven it to be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proponents of euthanasia argue that the individual has a right to choose and there is merit in this argument, as we live in a free and democratic society. However, as I quote the House of Lords:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of euthanasia is one in which the interests of the individual cannot be separated from the interests of society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that there are individual cases in which euthanasia may seem to be more appropriate, but individual cases cannot reasonably establish the foundation of a policy which would have such serious and widespread repercussions in the broader community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many examples in Australia where the state does override individual rights. One example is the speed limits on our roads. Individuals have the right to drive a car but, in the interests of the wider community, the state restricts people to speed limits. Another more recent example is the gun legislation, where many law&hyphen;abiding citizens were asked to forgo their individual right to own a firearm, which gave society, as a whole, the right to build a safer and more secure society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways, it is exactly the same with euthanasia, as I will demonstrate. It is the vulnerable and elderly who need to be protected by legislation from, perhaps, overzealous family members, doctors, financial institutions, and even themselves, if they are clinically depressed or mentally ill. It should also be noted that the overriding principle in the Judaeo&hyphen;Christian culture which has dominated most of the Western world is the principle of the sanctity of life and the need to preserve human life. This culture of life, not death, is not only endorsed by religious teachings but also, most importantly, by the medical fraternity by the Hippocratic oath. We already have an alarming rate of youth suicide in this country, so why should the state be sanctioning death as a preferred option to life?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, whilst I empathise with the notion of euthanasia and the right of the individual to choose, in reality it should not be allowed because it can lead to abuses. The most vulnerable people, not just the old but those who are disadvantaged, whether through poverty, race, physical or mental disability, are gravely at risk of being euthanised. There are checks and balances in the Northern Territory legislation, but it is also seriously flawed. No checks and balances can protect people from such things as severe mental illness or clinical depression following the announcement of a terminal illness. Checks and balances for these conditions are only as strong as the health system which diagnoses them. In many cases around Australia, I would not like to bet my life on some of the local health systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Providing the option of euthanasia could bring undue pressure on people who are ill or terminally ill. Instead of focusing on those precious days, weeks or months, and indeed perhaps a full recovery through adequate medical treatment, technological development or palliative <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7928"> care, many patients understandably may seek to take the easy option, more because of the fear of the unknown. In many cases the twilight zone for the terminally ill patients can be a very rewarding period in their lives which can be without suffering through palliative care or the administration of morphine and other drugs. Certainly it is society's responsibility to provide care facilities for these people, the disadvantaged within the community groups, rather than perhaps the abuse of euthanasia. I am particularly concerned with nursing homes or hospitals where economic rationalism may tend to drive budgets by freeing up overcrowded wards and cutting corners in an attempt to process terminally ill patients through the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The risk is that by legalising euthanasia it will place a dollar value on life rather than focus on providing adequate care for those individuals. We as a society would be sending a wrong signal to the community. Many speakers have spoken about the Netherlands example, but I do feel it would be remiss of me not to quote that it is revealed in Dutch findings that up to 27 per cent of people who were given a lethal injection had neither expressed consent nor had knowledge of the impending lethal injection. These statistics in themselves are enough to reconsider the inherent risk of individuals or doctors making poor decisions under undue pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All religious groups&mdash;as Kevin Andrews said in his speech&mdash;Aboriginal people and the vast majority of medical practitioners have rejected euthanasia. The underlying unifying principle is that people who are most at risk are the most vulnerable and a law which fails to protect the most vulnerable is always a bad law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pass on my personal experience in the passing of my grandmother where my mother, my uncle and my aunt cared for her more than she cared for life. There were times when my grandmother felt a burden to her brothers and to her daughters and loved ones. Understandably these feelings could fluctuate each day, from feeling like a major burden one day to being a member of a loving family the next. Certainly, having euthanasia could bring on rapid decision making for these individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to raise the administrative problems of law enforcement in the case of abuse. Just as medical opinions vary from doctor to doctor, I am sure problems of litigation and allegations of abuse could arise. Doctors already have enough risk of litigation to deal with, without adding the risk of facing allegations of murder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regarding opinion polls, there are those people who do not believe this is an issue which should be subject to a conscience vote and who call for a referendum on this issue. I give you the proportion of letters that have come into my office on this issue. To date I have received over 90 letters against euthanasia and seven letters for euthanasia. Although this is not an authoritative indication of the wishes of my electorate, it certainly is a barometer of a considerable opinion of local thought. Past examples have shown me that many measures of public opinion can be distorted without the correct question being asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there is the issue of states rights. I do not believe that states rights is an issue because we are dealing with a territory where the Commonwealth has always had constitutional power. It is written in black and white in our constitution. Whilst I empathise with Northern Territory law makers, the Commonwealth has used these constitutional powers in many cases before, notably with the Tasmanian privacy legislation. As Kevin Andrews said in his speech, the territories, just like the states, do have the responsibility to protect the ill and the vulnerable. There have been plenty of cases where the Commonwealth has overridden the states, notably that of the privacy bill which overrode the legislation in Tasmania.</PARA>

We use the terms passive voluntary euthanasia and active voluntary euthanasia. These terms are used very frequently, but again they are very open to varying interpretations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brian Pollard, who in 1992 commenced the first full&hyphen;time service in a general hospital in Sydney for the care of the dying, wrote in his book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The challenge of euthanasia</EMPHASIS>, certain aspects in which he very clearly demonstrated that euthanasia should not be legalised as it is impossible to remove sources of abuse. In the same book, reference is made to Holland where euthanasia is tolerated but remains illegal by statute law. Here the annual death rate from euthanasia is as high as 23,000 and this number includes many examples of abuse of the recommended safeguards and extensions to non&hyphen;voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legal, moral and ethical questions surrounding euthanasia are complex and can be very confusing, not only to ordinary people in our community but also to many professionals in both the health and the legal fields. Only yesterday, we read in our newspapers that Mr Rod Dent, the son of the first person to die by legally sanctioned euthanasia in Australia, has now withdrawn his support for the continuation of such a practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory legislation legalises euthanasia for those who can demonstrate that they are terminally ill. The question arises however, how does one determine terminally ill? Is it a person suffering from advanced stages of dementia? Is it a person suffering from advanced cancer? Is it a person suffering from severe brain injury yet still in control of bodily functions? The questions are many but, again, the definition is not precise. Pain or suffering takes many forms. Today, palliative care provides excellent relief and can be administered both in institutions such as hospitals and hospices and also in the comfort of a person's own home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point, I would like to pay tribute to the dedicated and tireless work carried out by administrators of palliative care. These people, both in the paid professional field as well as volunteers, are extremely committed in their work ensuring that their patients' pain is eased and their suffering controlled. I commend them for their dedication to humanity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my opinion, what is required in every state in Australia is more input and further research to ensure that the standard of palliative care is constantly improved and that every person seeking such care will have equal and easy access to avail himself or herself of this. Enhancing the promotion and awareness of palliative care programs is, in my opinion, extremely necessary. I say this because I believe that palliative care allows people to die with dignity and, in most cases today, free of pain when they reach the end of their natural life. As a health professional, I have witnessed people die in various states of suffering. I have also witnessed the wonderful expressions of peace and contentment on patients' faces when, as a result of receiving palliative care, suffering was relieved.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7930">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage, I would like to quote an excerpt from Dr McCullough who, in her report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Putting people down</EMPHASIS>, printed in May 1996, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right to life, whatever its quality, is universal and sacred among humankind. Those who genuinely want to die will find a way to suicide without assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>In a civilised society, respect for life is fundamental. So is respect for the aged, the disabled and the mentally ill. Making euthanasia legal places those among us who are vulnerable into an even more vulnerable position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For approximately the past 2,000 years, people qualified to provide medical assistance have been bound by the Hippocratic oath which states in part as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked.</PARA>
<PARA>Thus, to legalise euthanasia in any form, would directly impact on people's understanding of what constitutes medical treatment and how we perceive medicine should be practised. Man has always thought of doctors as healers. Indeed it is the ethical duty of every doctor to accept full responsibility for the care and wellbeing of their patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stated at the beginning of my speech that the issue we are debating today is complex. There are social, religious, philosophical and legal aspects to be considered. But these arguments will take much more than the time allocated for me here today to articulate. Therefore, I have outlined only a few reasons as to why legalised euthanasia should not be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking for the Kevin Andrews bill, I wish to conclude by stressing the fact that current research suggests that every model proposed to legalise euthanasia has thus far been shown to be flawed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been an enormous amount said in this debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 and I am not going to go over the ground covered by many other speakers. I just really want to talk about this from a personal point of view. I can say that in my 13 years in public life&mdash;seven here and six in local government&mdash;there has never been a more difficult decision that I have had to come to. I will go through the reasons for those difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first one is that I have absolutely no doubt that by casting my conscience vote, which I will be doing strongly in support of the Kevin Andrews bill, I am acutely aware that I am supporting the views of only some of my constituents, and that is difficult. I have no idea, and no way of knowing, whether my view is the majority view of my constituents. I suspect it is. But suspecting and knowing are two entirely different things. It may well be said that we are indeed making those sorts of decisions on a daily basis, that, as MPs, we are making decisions, voting on legislation downstairs, where we cannot ever know what the true majority view of our constituents is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the difference between those numerous divisions that I have been to or, where there has been no division, where a bill has been supported and this one is that in all my seven years, which is coming up in March, not one of them has involved the potential taking of life. That is what really sets aside this conscience vote and this bill from anything else that has confronted me and, I suspect, my colleagues behind me, including the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), who has been here a lot longer than I have. I suspect that this is probably the first time he has had to vote on life. I want to make it very clear that this is an entirely different debate from the ones that we normally have in this place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7931">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am supporting this bill for a number of reasons. I have personal significant discomfort with the concept of euthanasia. It is a personal view and very much a personal view and it is not based on reading scientific journals. It is not based on listening to the excellent arguments from both sides of this debate that we have had over the last three weeks. Rather it is a view formed from the heart. Whether there is room in the political system in the 1990s for something coming from the heart, I do not know, but in this particular case this is very much an issue that comes from the heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are several other matters that I am extremely concerned about. A debate about euthanasia is a debate about taking the most precious thing that we all have and that we all share, and that is life. For the whole Australian community not to be involved in that, I think, is very dangerous and it is one of the other reasons that I am supporting the Andrews bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, I believe that a conscience vote is totally inappropriate. It is inappropriate that I am standing here making decisions on behalf of nearly 80,000 good people in my electorate. I believe they deserve the right to be participants in a debate about something as serious as this, and they are not. If this debate continues after it is transferred back into the main chamber, I believe that it is essential that all Australian people have the right to vote on something as important and basic as this&mdash;and we are talking about life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like others, I have seen two close relations&mdash;people whom I have been extraordinarily close to&mdash;die the most appalling deaths. I suspect that those two people especially would have wanted me to support this bill because I believe that they believed in life. I think the longevity of life and the ability of an individual to extend their life as long as is humanly possible was very important to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For people to have the ability to forum shop for death&mdash;I know there are varying views about whether or not this is the right way to discuss this issue&mdash;or, if you like, forum shop for the taking of life, is something that I also find absolutely abhorrent. That is why I reiterate my views about the necessity for the Australian people to vote on this if it ever comes to that stage. It is totally wrong, in my view, for one small segment of the Australian community to have input into something as important as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have an apology to make and that is to the people in my electorate who do not share my views on this. I do apologise to them. I hope that they realise that this has been an extraordinarily difficult debate for me, personally, and, I suspect, for every other member of this House. I hope that they will judge me not on the decision that I have made, but on the reasons for reaching that decision. I do apologise to them. I want them to know why I passionately support the Kevin Andrews bill. As I said before, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is about something absolutely basic&mdash;and that is life. I thank you for the opportunity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like so many of my colleagues, I have found this issue to be an extremely difficult one. It is fair to say that I have agonised over it very deeply. We have to consider what we are and what we are here for. People commonly talk about politicians&mdash;frequently with some other adjective added to it. They very rarely talk about parliamentarians. I have to say to the committee that I was born disposed to being a parliamentarian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a young man I read everything I could about Pitt, Disraeli and Gladstone and the history of parliamentary democracy. I can still recall that when, as a very young man, I first entered a parliamentary chamber&mdash;the Legislative Assembly in Macquarie Street&mdash;my blood tingled. And I can say that when I come into our chamber my blood still tingles, because we are the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7932"> inheritors of so much struggle, so much difficulty and death, to achieve the level of parliamentary democracy that we have here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as reading about those early British prime ministers I mentioned, I was also incredibly influenced as a young man by Sir Winston Churchill and Robert Menzies who I believe were the ultimate in parliamentarians. So my whole attitude to being here has been dictated and dominated by a desire to be a parliamentarian, not just a politician. If it were possible to have as my epitaph `He was a parliamentarian', as far as I am concerned that would be enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one were just a politician, one could take a very easy answer to the question and say, `Yes, I will vote for the bill of the member for Menzies.' I am not suggesting for one moment that those who do vote for it are the lesser parliamentarians for it, from a purely political viewpoint. But I am afraid that, after a great deal of thought about it, I cannot vote for it. I wish to particularly thank the people in my electorate who were so very kind as to advise me of their views. Quite a lot of people wrote; a lot of people did not write but took opportunities at meetings, or when I was doing the shopping at Woolworths, to talk to me personally and tell me their views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not overly influenced by the public opinion polls. After all, it is like when an election is on&mdash;there is only one poll that counts, and that is when the votes are counted. Equally, I must confess to a little amusement at some of the letters I received, because they were form letters and still had the admonition on the bottom saying, `Write this out in your own handwriting. Don't use the form letter.' But I do thank those people in the community who did write and tell me their views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that when the Northern Territory was granted self&hyphen;government in 1978, the Northern Territory parliament was given power to make laws over all matters except four areas&mdash;industrial relations, uranium mining, Aboriginal land rights and Uluru and Kakadu national parks&mdash;and the Commonwealth retained a safeguard of being able to veto any legislation within six months of any law being passed. With the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, that six months passed and nobody took any action. The government of the day took no action, the opposition did not attempt to take any action, and the member for Menzies took no action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I have to say is that my very deep feeling is that this bill does not really address the question of euthanasia. I must make it quite clear&mdash;very clear&mdash;I am not an advocate of euthanasia. I regard all human life as being sacred. I am totally opposed to capital punishment. But while this bill is aimed at amending the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act 1978, the Australian Capital Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act 1988 and the Norfolk Island Act 1979, it is not a bill to remove the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. It is a bill to retrospectively say that the Northern Territory did not have the right to make that law. That is my sticking point; I cannot surmount that. To this extent, I believe&mdash;and I say this with the greatest goodwill to my friend Kevin Andrews&mdash;the bill is a sham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will not achieve what people think it is going to achieve. There are many people throughout our community who are actively supporting the Andrews bill, but it is not going to achieve what they want it to achieve. I think that a great many people who are against it for other reasons will eventually come to see that it will not achieve what they are seeking either.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7933">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we pass this bill, we introduce legislative discrimination against some citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia. If we do this, we are making every citizen in an Australian territory a second&hyphen;class citizen. From the whole basis of my life and my interest in life, I cannot do this. As far as I am concerned, we have to be absolutely non&hyphen;discriminatory in our approach to Australian citizens. I say this, too, in the context of the debate that has been sparked by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). We have to be non&hyphen;discriminatory and, by and large, we are. As an aside, I think we, as Australians, can be very proud of our country, our tolerance and our understanding&mdash;in fact, we have a lot to be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot concur with federal intervention in the lawful activities of a democratic government, a democratic parliamentary assembly of this nation. I would have hoped that the issue of euthanasia could have been addressed in some other way. I note that, in the closing paragraphs of his submission, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation is such that I would like it withdrawn and redrafted&mdash;and I have half a mind to move an amendment to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA>If the right honourable gentleman finds the other half of his mind to put with the first half, I would be very pleased to support him. It is a vitally important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a passionate and totally dedicated supporter of federalism in this country of ours; I am a passionate supporter of our constitution. I cannot accept that we will pass legislation which, as I said, will discriminate against some citizens of Australia. I did say to some of my constituents very early on that I would vote against euthanasia, but this bill is not about euthanasia. This bill is about a diminution of the Commonwealth of Australia and the federal system of Australia, and about the equal application of all rights for all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I state at the outset that I am opposing the Andrews private member's bill, the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, and casting a vote in support of the legislation which has been enacted by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. In doing so, I acknowledge the nature of this debate. It is a conscience vote. It is one of those rare occasions when we, as members of the House of Representatives&mdash;nearly all elected within the protocols of party discipline&mdash;are free to exercise our vote without regard to party policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I make no pretence that my vote is anything more than that. It is my own view representing totally my personal judgment. I do not pretend in any way that my judgment has been canvassed, either through my party political policy processes, or in any way with my broad constituency. It is a personal conscience vote and I do not wish to represent it in any other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reaching my personal conclusions, I know that there are many more learned than I who have made a different judgment, not the least being Barry Jones, a man whose intellect and foresightedness are widely respected in this nation. I have studied his contribution to this debate in depth and find that from the same facts and judgments I draw a different conclusion. My reasoning is relatively simple. I do not see the Northern Territory legislation in the way that it is portrayed by some. It is legislation which allows a person to take his or her decision and, albeit it is assisted, enact that decision individually. If one believes in the personal right to exercise choice, and I do&mdash;and I certainly want it for myself, and for my father&mdash;then there is no real choice unless there are dignified, highly caring and quality means to exercise that choice. This is what I believe the Northern Territory has done and I congratulate them for doing so.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7934">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would make a couple of other points. I do not have any illusions about the capacity of mankind to take the next step, turning voluntary&mdash;in fact, requested&mdash;action to bring one's life to an end, into a process of tidying up problems with the aged and infirm citizens, and relatives. I fully understand the arguments that the next step is an easy one to take and I agree that that is so. But I say in this parliament right now that I will fight as hard as I have to to prevent a move to that next step, and that is the adoption of euthanasia policy issues by governments or by people that mean that people are facing involuntary choices. I would do that just as firmly as I support the aims of the current Northern Territory legislation, which provides what I choose to call assisted passage, which is your personal choice. I do not see it as a states rights issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it just one of the paradoxes of politics that in my party on our side of the House we do not have the dilemma of the issue of states' rights. We are an overtly federalist party. We understand and accept and, in fact, we demand the right of the Commonwealth government to intervene in the affairs of the states where it thinks it is required. It is many on the other side of the House who have personal dilemmas with that. So in this case, I find myself supporting the legislation of the Northern Territory, finding it strange that the reverse argument about the rights of the territory to make legislation is being used by many on the other side. But that is the nature of this debate. It is one that does not fit tidily into any of our conventional policy notions or structures. In fact, it is almost a complete juxtaposition of those issues. But I am making it clear that in supporting the Northern Territory legislation in this way, I am not conceding my personal view that the Commonwealth has an overriding role and power and so I am not raising in the debate in any way the argument that I believe the Commonwealth has the right, or that the Northern Territory rights come into it. It is not an issue which I think enters it all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess it finally comes down to, when we exercise a conscience vote in this place, I do not know what rules to operate by. The only ones I can come to are, `Do unto others as you would have them do unto you', or `Practise what you preach'. In my own case, I very firmly want the right, providing I am capable, to make that choice for myself and I want the right for my father to be able to make it, because he is my only living relative who might come to this point in the not too distant future. I would want him to have the right to make a choice. If I want it for me and my family, then I have to be prepared to want it for the Australian people&mdash;and I do. That is the sole basis on which I have reached this conclusion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this most sensitive issue of euthanasia as a response to concerns felt by me and within the electorate of Bowman. Of all the written and spoken responses to the current legislation that have been received by me, the overwhelming concern has been drawn to the fact that the deliberate act of terminating any life is abhorrent and not fitting the vast majority of community opinion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response to this issue has been, for many people, an opportunity to voice their concern about bureaucratic decisions that have impacted on their own personal experience, or worry about the consequences that this legislation will have further down the track. Some of the concerns raised include comments such as `Where will it stop?'; `Respect for all human life from the womb to the tomb is the very foundation of all civilised society'; `A society that deliberately kills certain of its members is basically very sick'; `The devaluation of human life in our country has become quite worrying'; and `There are countless ways this legislation could and would be abused'. These are but a few of the statements that I have received. My <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7935"> response has been by way of a general reply. However, I have taken all their considerations on board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there were a measure of how compassionate a community is perceived to be, I would have to say that that measure would be how we treat our weakest and most vulnerable members of the community. The frail elderly, long&hyphen;term chronically ill and the terminally ill should feel no doubt that a government that represents the collective goodwill of the Australian populace has their best interests at heart. As a matter of conscience, I have no doubt in reassuring those in acute care that the provision of palliative care&mdash;appropriate, tender and supportive assistance&mdash;will be provided for those in the sunset days of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By denying the opportunity to show a caring and compassionate response to the dying we, as humanly responsible arbiters, would become inhumane and hard hearted, dispassionate and aloof from the very essential nature of ourselves. To dispose of a human life through a bureaucratic process of consultation, along with an array of professional care givers assigning the approval for dispatching of a patient to a document, is looming on the horizon as a bizarre aberration of the death and dying process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While not denying an individual's right to terminate their own suffering, state sanctioned murder is not what I believe we, as parliamentarians, were elected to ratify. It is essentially against the basic instincts of preservation of the species that a medical practitioner would assist in extinguishing a life by bureaucratic decree. If we are to be, to be seen to be and to endeavour to be a caring and compassionate society, we have to maintain a sensitive and appropriate regimen in the provision of palliative care for those aged and dying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Health care workers, ministers of religion and those who have travelled the journey towards life's end with a loved one or a patient have all expressed to me the fact that at no time did any of these people ask to be relieved of life. In other words, although they knew they were dying, those in care appreciated all the efforts and intentions of all care givers and relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that palliative care was not an option for those who have already determined their very public termination of life. The need for the provision of palliative care in the Northern Territory is a glaring flaw in this whole scenario.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a society have come a long way from the dawn of time, through countless ages of turmoil, change, progress and evolution to arrive at a place in time where the elected representatives of our great nation are deliberating on this life and death issue. It is of great significance and import that our considerations will either overturn the territory legislation or not, that inevitably the state approval for terminating one's life is allowed or not allowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea of states rights is not what I consider as important or as crucial to the whole debate as the right of any person, body, jurisdiction or government to deem a condition of life&mdash;that is, terminal illness&mdash;to be the reason to terminate a life earlier than as nature would have determined. That is tampering with natural justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What can be found now, already existing within those places that minister to the dying, is a sense of deep commitment and duty of care aimed at making those last days of a dying person's life comfortable, restful and pleasant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope that most people in this difficult time of life are drawn into the circle of care by health workers, doctors, relatives and friends who comfort and support those grieving and dying. After all, death comes to us all&mdash;only sooner to some than others. For those in protracted pain and facing terminal illness, a long established network and system for caring <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7936"> has developed. Governments even train people to assist those in need of acute care, intensive care, critical care, the aged, frail and the terminally ill. Do we wish to deny these people and those who have to cope with death and the dying, the opportunity to travel over life's last hurdle?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are at one end of life's long journey, contemplating whether to assist a terminally ill patient to end their suffering and at the very same time spending time, energy and lots of money on endeavouring to prevent youth suicide and black deaths in custody, even though those groups have made a conscious decision to end their own short precious lives. Isn't this confusing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been brought forward is the concept that desensitising of one's outlook on life and illness occurs when the right to terminate life occurs. We all know what happens to a horse with a broken leg, a dog that has reached at least 15 years, a diseased or feral cat or animal. They have all reached their use&hyphen;by date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Northern Territory legislation attempts to do is put people in the same category as a diseased animal, only offer them, while they are still compos, the opportunity of a lifetime&mdash;instant death. The terminally ill do not really need to have this as an option. It would be more appropriate to offer the same circumstance to life&hyphen;sentenced criminals and to those who committed heinous crimes against humanity. They truly deserve to die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our terminally ill do not, and have not asked to be placed in such a circumstance where they could ask for early extinction. They deserve better than that. They deserve our best care, our greatest concern, our constant attention and our respect for the dignity afforded those who cannot help themselves, the ultimate acknowledgment of their condition and our time, our love and devotion. For these are the human elements of our existence, our display of sharing and caring. For these reasons, I commend Kevin Andrews' bill and will work towards overturning the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I take this opportunity in concluding this second reading debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill to commend all speakers who have participated in this debate for their contribution. As has been pointed out, all the political parties have granted their members a conscience vote because of the recognition that this is a matter of profound importance and a recognition that there are a range of sincerely held and differing views, many of which have been expressed in profound and in sometimes very moving ways in the debate in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter which is difficult because of the nature of the issue we are dealing with. It requires considerable thought and consideration, taking into account our own emotional experiences, the social circumstances of our communities in the nation in which we live, the role of laws in our society, and the consequences that changing the law will have both for Australians who live today and possibly those in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this matter was first raised, which seems a long time ago, it was said by many people, and by a range of media commentators in particular, that this would be a divisive debate; that there would be people taking different views in this parliament and there was some expectation that we might not talk to each other again because of those different views. Contrary to those assertions, what this debate has shown is that the members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth parliament can show great maturity and great tolerance towards differing views and opinions which are sincerely held about such a profound matter as this. Without in any sense wishing to be patronising to any of my colleagues, I want to say that I believe <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7937"> this debate, regardless of its outcome, has shown the great maturity that members of the Commonwealth parliament are capable of, something for which I commend all my colleagues&mdash;those who have spoken and those who have not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as I am aware, members have been able to put their views freely and to have those views respected. Different views have been expressed by members of the same party right across the political spectrum and those views have been respected by all other members. Because the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) is in the chamber, I note that on this issue he and I obviously differ. But what I can say about him and about those who have taken a different view to mine in this debate is that I believe the way in which we have respected those views and been able to get on with the rest of the life of this place is something for which all can be commended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not wish to rehearse all the arguments that have been raised in this debate, but I do want to comment on one or two things. One is that quite a number of members expressed regret that this debate did not take place in the main chamber of the House of Representatives. I have said before, and I will say again for the public record, that I have considerable sympathy with that point of view. Secondly, although many members have spoken on this bill there has also been widespread discussion within the parties and over the last few months, through the organisation of seminars by the Parliamentary Library and through private initiatives, there have been occasions when members and senators have had an opportunity to listen to and have discussions with people who have particular views about this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an example, I recall a meeting and seminar arranged by the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) at which the framer of the initial Northern Territory legislation, the Hon. Marshall Perron, was present and addressed his views about it. I also recall a seminar at which members of the Northern Territory Aboriginal community were able to express their views and discuss the matter with members of this place. I think that is indicative of the widespread discussion which has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this bill has done, regardless of one's views ultimately about it, is engender a national debate about this issue; a national debate which, as I have said from the outset, I think is important. If there are going to be profound changes to the law in this country on a matter that goes to the life and death of the citizens of this nation, then it should only occur after there has been national debate. I am proud to have had some part to play in trying to raise that national debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what the outcome of the vote will be, but if the members of the House by a majority pass the bill and it goes to the Senate, then I would remind anybody reading these remarks that the Senate has established a committee to examine the bill in more detail. I encourage those Australians, whatever their view on this matter is, to make a submission to that committee because, in that way, democracy works at its best in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to single out any contribution in particular, but I do want to say something about one matter which was raised in the debate: the proposed amendments that were foreshadowed by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Jones) in his contributions. In his thoughtful contribution, the honourable member for Lalor made suggestions about the enabling provisions of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the part of the bill that says that the legislative assemblies of the territories have the power to make laws about certain things which relate to the withdrawal or refusal of burdensome, unwanted or futile treatment. He suggested that, based on the experience of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7938"> refusal of treatment legislation in Victoria and South Australia, there ought to be an encouragement to the legislative assemblies to make laws for the appointment of an agent, by a patient, where that agent can then make treatment decisions for the patient if the patient should become incapable or incompetent and therefore unable to make those decisions. That is the state of law in Victoria and South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lalor also suggested that, through this bill, we ought to be encouraging those territories that have not done so to repeal their legal sanctions against attempted suicide. I indicated in discussions with the honourable member that nothing in the bill precluded the territories from making laws to that effect, but that I did not have any fundamental objection to actually setting out that encouragement in the terms of the bill itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am simply indicating here that, after discussions with the honourable member for Lalor, I am minded to accept those two amendments which he is putting forward. They will be put forward in relation to each of the three territories which the bill relates to. That is further encouragement for the Northern Territory and the other territories to enact laws which are similar to the refusal of treatment legislation in Victoria, and similar legislation in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, in the introductory first reading of this bill, I said that I believed there were two things that should be done in place of introducing legislation such as the Northern Territory's. The first is to introduce modern refusal of treatment legislation, as in Victoria and South Australia. I conclude by again encouraging that course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, in this country we need to take note of the massive advances being made in relation to the provision of palliative care and the development of the specialities of palliative care medicine in this country and provide a national framework for that palliative care and for the increasing resourcing of palliative care services in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think those measures&mdash;on the one hand, the provision of modern refusal of treatment legislation; on the other hand, the proper resourcing of palliative care in this country&mdash;are measures which ultimately will do a great deal for people in the dying stages of their lives. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Report No. 346, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guarding the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General</EMPHASIS> , is a most aptly named report from the Joint Committee <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7939"> of Public Accounts, and I want to draw the attention of the parliament to some of the remarks that have been made within the report and to commend the committee for its work in producing the report. Firstly we find, in the foreword of the chairman, remarks to this effect:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the JCPA considers the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General to be absolutely fundamental to public accountability in Australia. If the Auditor&hyphen;General is not properly resourced&mdash;or does not have a legislative mandate&mdash;to carry out an effective and broad scrutiny of the pubic sector, then Parliament itself is compromised in its ability to hold the Executive Government to account.</PARA>
<PARA>They are very apt and very well chosen words. The background to this report is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicated, when he was Leader of the Opposition, that a Liberal government would establish `a completely independent Auditor&hyphen;General, so that a fearless and authoritative surveillance of government departments can occur without intimidation from the executive.' He went on to say that, under the coalition, the Auditor&hyphen;General would be an officer of the parliament. I guess that a large part of the work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was in determining how to give effect to the concept of making the Auditor&hyphen;General an officer of the parliament. Throughout the report there are a number of references to how this might be done and what its implications were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee went on to say in its report that it regarded this inquiry as being of profound importance to public accountability in Australia and that it believed that the community expected the parliament to hold the executive to account for their use of public funds. Things such as disclosures of profligacy or fraud in the use of public moneys, or incompetence or inefficiency in the management of public services, naturally provoke public outrage; and the parliament in turn relies on the Auditor&hyphen;General to provide expert independent advice to help it to fulfil its function of scrutinising executive agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the committee, the Auditor&hyphen;General performs a function which makes an important contribution to effective parliamentary scrutiny where the parliament itself lacks the technical expertise and resources to exercise the function. The committee went on to say that, if the parliament cannot ensure the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General from the executive and if the executive can effectively inhibit the effective discharge of all its functions by starving the Auditor&hyphen;General of resources, then the chain of public accountability is broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The joint committee went on to say that the parliament and, in particular, the parliamentary committees which examine in detail the financial affairs and the performance of government agencies are becoming increasingly reliant on the Auditor&hyphen;General to hold the government of the day to account. The challenges to public accountability that we experience now, with the complexity of the arrangements by which governments deliver their services, can only be met with the assistance of a well&hyphen;equipped and fiercely independent Auditor&hyphen;General. They are very important remarks that have been made by the committee concerning the importance of the work of the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report went on to make some remarks and recommendations concerning issues of tenure, dismissal, and reappointment, and indicated that under the Audit Act the Auditor&hyphen;General is appointed until age 65 and can only be dismissed for incapacity, incompetence or misbehaviour. This can only be done by the Governor&hyphen;General, following an address from each house of parliament in the same session of parliament. The committee heard evidence, from people of the stature of Sir Lenox Hewitt OBE and Mr John Nethercote, arguing strongly against anything which would change the tenure of the Auditor&hyphen;General and indicating their view that the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General would be most adversely affected if there <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7940"> were changes to the tenure by way of a fixed term and to the capacity for reappointment, and things of that nature. There was great concern expressed about those possible changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we move on to the committee's report on pages 23 and 24, we see that there were further remarks about the independence of the auditor and the importance of the Auditor&hyphen;General being able to determine his or her own priorities for investigation so they should not be subject to the executive in terms of the issues they investigate. The committee said it believes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor&hyphen;General, by the very nature of the position, develops breadth and depth of knowledge of public sector management, and is best placed to identify priorities for audit.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It follows that it is essential for the Auditor&hyphen;General to have freedom to determine the audit programme of the ANAO, including the choice of bodies to be audited, the nature and scope of audits to be conducted, and whether the work will be carried out by the ANAO or contracted out to private enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, the committee said that the Auditor&hyphen;General needed to be able to determine his or her own priorities. It made very important remarks about the issue of the appointment of the auditor. Quoting the Australasian Council of Auditors&hyphen;General it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a generally held principle that an auditee should not appoint the auditor because, in so doing, the independence or perceived independence of the auditor can be compromised. In the private sector this principle is buttressed by parliament's requirements that the shareholders of public companies, rather than the directors of the board or the executive, appoint the external auditor.</PARA>
<PARA>So they pointed out that if you want to make an analogous situation with the states or the Commonwealth, you are really looking at appointment by the parliament rather than by the executive. Indeed, this report makes significant recommendations in precisely that direction. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee believes that the parliament should have a right of final approval in relation to the Auditor&hyphen;General and not just a right to be consulted.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee is also concerned that that process of appointment should not be unwieldy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very timely that we get this report from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts because in Victoria we have the most extraordinary situation where the Victorian government has decided that government agencies might be able to appoint their own auditors, effectively bypassing the Victorian Auditor&hyphen;General. Premier Kennett has set up a review apparently with this objective in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to talk about issues that relate to the independence of the Auditors&hyphen;General, it is worth having a look at what some of the experts in the field have suggested about this issue. For example, the New South Wales Auditor&hyphen;General, Mr Tony Harris, described moves to examine privatising the functions of Mr Ches Baragwanath, the Victorian Auditor&hyphen;General, as being in direct contrast to recommendations from royal commissions. Mr Harris said that both the Fitzgerald inquiry into police corruption in Queensland and the Western Australian Inc. royal commission had shown that private sector auditors had failed to locate significant corporate failures until after they had occurred. Neither royal commission contemplated that any government could act to weaken the strength of the Auditor&hyphen;General, Mr Harris said, and so using their logic, any weakening of the role of the Auditor&hyphen;General must increase the risk of corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> has expressed concern about these terms of reference which would potentially allow government agencies to appoint their own auditors and bypass the Victorian Auditor&hyphen;General's office, thereby seriously eroding his power to vet government actions. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7941"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> went on to say that the recent revelations that two of the three members of the government appointed review panel have been associated with companies involved in matters which previously drew serious criticism from the Victorian Auditor&hyphen;General is of some concern. And well it might be because what we, in fact, have is that two of the three people are Mr Ken Spencer, a director of Crown Casino and a key Citylink company. Back in May, a report by Mr Baragwanath found that the government had undercharged Crown Casino $174 million in tax for 150 extra gaming tables&mdash;a very serious and scathing report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the Auditor&hyphen;General had also commented adversely on the Sandridge City Development Company, of which one of the directors was Mr John Dahlsen, a second person appointed to review the Office of the Victorian Auditor&hyphen;General. So you have two of the people conducting this review into the Office of the Victorian Auditor&hyphen;General having been in the past subject of adverse reports by the Victorian Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian Premier once again shows himself to be, on occasion, a person of some ability but utterly corrupt. Like rotten mackerel at moonlight, he shines and stinks. It is appalling that we have directors of companies that have been reported on adversely by the Auditor&hyphen;General now being required to investigate whether the Auditor&hyphen;General in Victoria can be bypassed by allowing government departments to appoint their own auditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take the committee back to the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which make it clear that the Auditor&hyphen;General ought to be able to determine his own program of work. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a generally held principle that an auditee should not appoint the auditor because in so doing the independence or perceived independence of the auditor can be compromised.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly right. The joint committee went on to make recommendations to enshrine this principle in legislation, a principle which I strongly support. Recommendation 14 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor&hyphen;General Bill should provide that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Auditor&hyphen;General is to be appointed as the auditor of all Commonwealth entities; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Auditor&hyphen;General has a general mandate to initiate the full range of audits in relation to all Commonwealth entities (including performance audits of Government Business Enterprises).</PARA>
<PARA>In so doing, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has repudiated the proposals of the Victorian Premier which would undermine the independence of the Victorian Auditor&hyphen;General. It has made it clear that the Auditor&hyphen;General should be appointed with the involvement of the parliament through the Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommissioned as an audit committee of the parliament, and that that Auditor&hyphen;General would be able to set his or her own program of investigations and not have this situation, spuriously justified by reference to competition policy, whereby the Auditor-General might be, effectively, bypassed, with government departments being able to determine their own audit arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, private sector auditors, as others have noted, have not been able to determine failures in advance. They have only been able to determine these things after the event. As a result, many bodies have decided that the Kennett government's decision to review the scope of the state Auditor&hyphen;General's powers is unwelcome. The National Competition Council said that this was not a priority of the national competition agreement. We have had the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and even the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly all saying that they do not think that this is the right way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the former Chairman of the Victorian Public Accounts and Estimates Committee&mdash;and, indeed, I served on that Public Accounts and Estimates Committee under Mr Weideman&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7942"> indicating that the government should not be holding this kind of review. A number of Liberal backbenchers, lacking the courage, let me say, to have themselves named, off the record indicated that they are outraged by this proposal. And well they might be because, if we look at the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, aptly named <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guarding the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General</EMPHASIS>, this has to be a priority for any parliament, be it the Commonwealth parliament, the Victorian parliament, or the parliaments of other states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is coming up with recommendations that give effect to that most important concept, the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General, and seeking to safeguard that through a variety of recommendations. But I am most disturbed that, while the Commonwealth is making these sorts of appropriate moves, in Victoria we have the Auditor&hyphen;General being scuttled for daring to criticise, as he has done on occasion, measures of the Victorian government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of brief comments on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 346</EMPHASIS> , as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in the 37th parliament and again in the 38th parliament, and having been also a participant in this inquiry and the previous inquiry into the role of the Auditor&hyphen;General in the Commonwealth. I note with interest the comments of the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) with regard to Victoria. At some stages in the processes and activities of the office of the Auditor&hyphen;General under the previous incumbent of that position&mdash;not the current incumbent&mdash;there were times when the relationship between the former Auditor&hyphen;General and the former government of the Commonwealth of Australia was strained. It is in that regard that we were attempting to identify some key areas where there should be no dissent as far as the activities of the Auditor&hyphen;General are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very first recommendation in this report highlights the importance of the perception as well as, nominally, the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General as being not an advocate of the executive, not an advocate of government, but a person who is working on behalf of the parliament of Australia and therefore, by extension, the people of Australia in so far as his or her review of what activities of the Commonwealth are being undertaken. Recommendation No. 1 is one of the key recommendations in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us in this parliament that work in close proximity to the Commonwealth departments know that the Auditor&hyphen;General is independent. We felt it important that that position be nominally declared that way so that it gives much more succour to the people of Australia that they have a watchdog watching not only what government is doing but also what the bureaucracy is doing. It is very important in that regard that this recommendation be accepted, and we look forward with anticipation to the government's response to this report and recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other recommendation I want to comment on, and which the previous speaker did allude to, is also very important. That is recommendation No. 14, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor&hyphen;General Bill should provide that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Auditor&hyphen;General is to be appointed as the auditor of all Commonwealth entities; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Auditor&hyphen;General has a general mandate to initiate the full range of audits in relation to all Commonwealth entities (including performance audits of Government Business Enterprises).</PARA>
<PARA>Government business enterprises are government businesses. The government is the sole shareholder in those business enterprises. Again, by extension, they are owned by the taxpayers of Australia. There is a reasonable expectation by the taxpayers of Australia that their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7943"> auditor&mdash;their independent auditor, the defender of the interests of the people of Australia in these organisations&mdash;should have the ability to access and perform not financial audits, where it is just tick, tick, tick, but performance audits. Then the shareholders of those government business enterprises, the taxpayers of Australia, can be assured that those businesses are being managed productively and efficiently on their behalf and that it is being done in quite a prudent way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the Main Committee for its indulgence in allowing me to make a few remarks on that, and I commend the report to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on this report. Firstly, I want to congratulate Alex Somlyay and the committee. This is a very important report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that you start having an even greater interest in the role of the parliament once you shift from the government to the opposition benches. Those power imbalances that you found discomforting in government become alarming in opposition. But seriously, as members of parliament we all have a responsibility as we go toward the year 2000 to make this institution stronger and more effective. That is not altogether easy, particularly in our House, which is the House of the executive, the House that the executive dominates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of committees is fundamentally important. I am not trying to score some cheap points, but the truth of the matter is that the committees, which I have described as the universities of parliament, have been curtailed significantly by financial cutbacks. People want to run the argument with me that, yes, they are still doing good work, et cetera. I think that is true too, and I guess this report is in part a reflection of it. But once you cut the financial resources of committees without trying to rebalance and get some intellectual horsepower into it, you are diminishing the role of the backbenchers on both sides of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important aspect of the role of parliamentarians is having input from independent officers of the parliament, and this is where my particular compliments go to the Public Accounts Committee because it has looked at the independent role of the Auditor&hyphen;General. I have been very interested in the Ombudsman, who is in a similar position&mdash;that is, she is not a member of the executive, her role is seen as being independent, but it also needs guarding. In fact, it was my privilege to introduce a private member's bill which sought to strengthen the role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis the rest of the executive. I must say I wish I had had this report available, or benefit of the discussions that led to the report, prior to the private member's bill, because I certainly would have picked up some of the initiatives in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the particular initiatives is that there should be an audit committee. If I have one quibble with the recommendations, it is that it suggests that the audit committee is going to approve the budget for the Auditor&hyphen;General. Theoretically, I must say I am very attracted to that proposition, but I think the reality will fall short and we will not get governments of the day to agree to it. But having an audit committee gives the Auditor&hyphen;General a great deal of opportunity, particularly given the new method of appointment and the hearings that are proposed. In fact, what the audit committee really becomes is the champion, if you like, of the Auditor&hyphen;General in terms of the function that he performs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the pleasing innovations I introduced as chairman of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee was for the first time to actually have the Human Rights Commissioner come before the human rights subcommittee. It had not been done before. I am pleased that in this parliament we have actually seen the Ombudsman, who I think also <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7944"> fulfils a very important human rights role in Australia, come before the human rights subcommittee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor&hyphen;General has enjoyed, over the time I have been in this place, an excellent relationship with the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and the committee is to be commended for that. Mind you, it mostly deals with his work, that is, all the audit reports that are presented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am trying to say, I guess, is that we not only need to try to provide some legislative protection for these independent officers of the parliament&mdash;the Ombudsman and the Auditor&hyphen;General&mdash;but equally it is the informal links that can be of critical importance. When the Auditor&hyphen;General knows he has the confidence of the audit committee, he can bring issues of concern to the audit committee. We, in turn, as members of parliament hold that committee responsible for sifting through those concerns and bringing to our notice anything worthy of our attention and placing it on the public record, so that, whether you are in opposition or you are a government backbencher or a senator, it is on the record. If more people outside the place want to take note of what has been placed on the public record, that is even more to the good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have commented on the issue of resourcing, which is a very difficult issue. What happens at the moment is that the Auditor&hyphen;General is an outrider of Finance, the Ombudsman is an outrider of PM&amp;C, and what you tend to find with outrider organisations is that they take a deeper cut than the department itself. It is so much easier for the department head to justify why his own specific portfolio responsibilities need to be maintained, or be less cut into than some of the other organisations. Indeed, that is what has happened in this budget. And in relation to the Ombudsman, I think that will have tragic consequences for ordinary Australians in their ability to have access to a level of justice with regard to complaints about the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that a 1994&hyphen;95 report of the Auditor&hyphen;General is yet to be adequately responded to in allowing her to follow the money trail, because so much these days is outsourced from departments to other providers. It is no good just holding the department accountable because they can always say, `We are not fulfilling this function.' There needs to be a healthy debate about that. But, at the end of the day, I think all members of parliament will want to say, `If it is a Commonwealth function, irrespective of how or who is performing it, we want to follow the dollar trail.' It may come as a surprise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is not the individual citizens who tend to be the worst victims of this, it is actually small business. They are the victims and the Ombudsman cannot deal with it. So resources is a big issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are saying that the audit committee will approve the budget, I wish you luck. We cannot even insulate this parliament. The Senate's role and responsibility, in opposition, is something I am now recasting in my own mind's eye. But even the Senate, as powerful as it is, cannot protect itself from cutbacks&mdash;much less the House. It is a terrible admission we make as members of parliament. If there are more effective and efficient ways of doing things, of course we are open to it and would respond to it, but we cannot protect ourselves from cutbacks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, I would argue passionately that there are a couple of things we need to do with committees. We need to get some young university graduates, perhaps honours graduates, in there on a 12&hyphen; to 18&hyphen;month basis and put them on a special contract. Maybe we could have one, two or three. It would give the committees some real horsepower, give these people some experience and really make the committees more effective. It would be a very cost&hyphen;effective <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7945"> way of spending the dollar. We cannot pretend to the Australian people that committees are going to be as effective as we would like them to be when we keep on tightening the purse strings. The demands on committees for reports, investigations and studies are increasing, not diminishing. I know people like to say you can do more with less&mdash;and maybe you can initially&mdash;but there comes a point where you cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all have a stake in the institution of parliament and parliamentarians being seen to be more responsive to the Australian people. We try to do that in our electorates. But the way we do it as an institution is through our committee work and through the important work being done by people such as the Auditor&hyphen;General, the Ombudsman and perhaps also the human rights commissioners. That is why they deserve special attention, special merit and special concern by all members of parliament.</PARA>

I congratulate them on their report. The report, modestly entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 346</EMPHASIS> , is an exceptionally important report. For people who are not on the committee, I would have to say that government members&mdash;more than opposition members&mdash;have a responsibility to make sure that this report is not merely tabled, thrown away or the subject of various discussions and nothing else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you do for the Auditor&hyphen;General is going to have ramifications for the Ombudsman. Already the Senate is looking at my private member's bill in relation to the Ombudsman. Without any disrespect to the Senate committee, I would invite them to look at this report, because I see my feeble attempts to strengthen her role and function and to provide some safeguards, which the Auditor&hyphen;General is proposed to have in this report, would really sit well with her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Ombudsman has never had a relationship with a committee as the Auditor&hyphen;General has with the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and it has left her vulnerable. I think it is a most important function. I ask the committee not to be disappointed if every recommendation that has been made is not implemented. I think there is much that we should resist not being implemented. In the year 2000, all institutions have to re&hyphen;evaluate themselves. In this parliament, we want to become more relevant and more meaningful to people. The most effective way we can do it as members of parliament is to look at the institution and the institutions it services, and particularly the committees. I commend the report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, before commencing my remarks, I thank you and the two whips for allowing me to complete the debate on this particular issue, even though we will go slightly over time. I respect your generosity and I will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7946"> keep my comments as brief as possible. We are reporting on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Keeping rural Australia posted&mdash;an inquiry into Australia Post: rural and remote letter delivery services</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was on this committee, both in the 37th and 38th parliaments, on this particular issue, and there were three terms of reference common to both parliaments. They were the need for and the extent of Australia Post's community service obligation; the cost and funding of those community service obligations, given the size of Australia Post's commercial obligations; and the capacity of Australia Post to maintain current performance standards and options for increasing those performance standards under section 28C of the Australia Postal Corporation Act 1989 in those communities. There was a fourth term of reference in the 37th parliament, which the committee touched on later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For people in remote and rural Australia, the postal service is a vital part of communications. I come from one such area and it is a common theme wherever I move in my electorate and, indeed, outside my electorate, when people knew that I was on this inquiry, to raise this matter of postal services and communications in general. We have seen in the parliament in the last week just how ferociously Australians guard their access to communications&mdash;indeed, even to the point of the way they are delivered and the visual efficacy of how they are delivered. But for people in country areas, that luxury is not always available. A basic service is what they sometimes have to settle for. As the whole face of communications changes, with interactive cable services, e&hyphen;mail, faxes, modems, telephone cost reductions and the Internet, there is great anxiety in rural areas about where postal services might end up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The postal service is still arguably the most important communications service for country and rural people&mdash;certainly the most important after a basic telephone service. It is interesting to note by way of background just where Australia Post stands in the world. The cost of sending a letter in Australia is, as you know, 45c. In New Zealand it is 42c; in Canada and the US, 44c&mdash;I am quoting the costs in Australian currency&mdash;going right up to 99c in Germany and $1.31 in Japan. So Australia Post has much to commend it in being able to give such a good service to a very diverse nation over a large area for 45c.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note the value of privatisation and the move towards corporatisation in many government agencies, although I am not suggesting for a moment that we should go beyond corporatisation of Australia Post. It is interesting to note that the profit in millions of dollars for Australia Post is $249 million a year, compared with $39 million in Canada, a negative figure of $1.7 billion in the US, about $560 million in the UK and about $101 million in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that, of the postal authorities in the nations I have mentioned, only the ones in Australia, the UK and New Zealand pay tax. Interestingly again, they would appear to be the ones that have the best return on assets, at 25 per cent in New Zealand, 12&half; per cent in Australia and seven per cent in Great Britain, whereas Canada and the US have very low figures, if not negative figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want my comments to be interpreted as an attack on Australia Post; they are not. But there is, as I said, a very real concern about the community service obligation. As the terms of reference state, this inquiry is focused primarily on an examination of Australia Post's community service obligation; that is, an obligation when a government specifically requires a public enterprise to carry out activities relating to outputs or inputs which it would not elect to do on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7947">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, Australia Post is required by law to deliver the standard letter within Australia at a standard rate of 45c, regardless of the costs incurred. The findings of the committee were in support of maintaining this standard rate. Furthermore, we believed that that should be by cross&hyphen;subsidisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We received 249 submissions to the inquiry and 11 exhibits. Out of that, we then took evidence from a wide cross&hyphen;section of government, private industry and the various government agencies. Out of that came 20 specific recommendations, and one general recommendation for an ongoing investigation into Australia Post's reserve services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main thing we recommended was that there be another:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . polling exercise of the 80,000 people who do not have a `to the property' delivery.</PARA>
<PARA>If those communities vote for a `to the property' service, we believe that that should be delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recommended that the `to the property' delivery be based on recommendation 1, the one I have just quoted, and that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia Post first give priority to households with students studying by distance education or with people requiring a regular supply of medicines.</PARA>
<PARA>You must remember that in many regional and remote areas there are no pharmacies and that is a very important part of the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also recommended that 51 Aboriginal communities, greater than 50 km from Australia Post retail facilities, be given Australia Post retail facilities and that we look at, generally, Australia Post services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and their general access to postal services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, my main concern was with four of these recommendations. One was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia Post upgrade Licensed Post Offices or Community Postal Agencies to include banking services in cases where the standard banking service in a rural or remote community are closed. If necessary, the cost of this service should be included in the community service obligation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>As you well know, a lot of banks have withdrawn from rural areas and this is a very important aspect of rural life. A lot of government services have been withdrawn over the last decade, both state and federal, and with banks going that has left many communities devoid of any sort of service. Australia Post is developing such a banking service and we have recommended that that should be part of the community service obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is also not generally recognised is that there are three levels of post office: the corporate post offices which are still run by Australia Post itself; licensed post offices which are somewhat of a franchise, if you like, run by individuals on a profit basis; and community postal agencies which are sometimes in a hardware store, or a general store, or something like that, in a country town. My general view is that these have not been given much of a go, especially the lower tier&mdash;the community postal agency&mdash;and that point was made very clear during the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two ways you can deliver a community service obligation: one is to have a line in your budget, the other is to cross-subsidise. We believe, in a bipartisan way, that it is absolutely essential that the cross-subsidy provision be maintained. We believe that the budget line is subject to tampering by future governments and should not be tolerated. The government also is asked to:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7948">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . give an undertaking to rural and remote Australia that it will not use budgetary payments as a means of paying for Australia Post's Community Service Obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>We have asked that heritage buildings, which are also a very important part of provincial Australia and some parts of rural Australia, be maintained and that provision be made on the books of Australia Post to recognise that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very wide ranging inquiry with quite a lot of submissions and witnesses, and there were those 20 recommendations. Looking to the future, we have recommended in a general way that the government, by way of inquiry, looking for revenue generated by reserve services, look at the comparative efficiencies of reserve services and non-reserve services. It should look at the question of reducing the reserve services to three, two or one times the standard letter rate, and the implications for Australia Post operations as a result of the potential growth in indirect competition from telephone, facsimile and electronic mail, which I referred to earlier in my address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank you for your indulgence and I commend the report to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The geographical area covered by the Department's Area Melbourne East has changed three times since 1 July 1990. The current Regional Office configuration has, however, been in place since 1992&hyphen;93 and reliable data can only be provided from that financial year onwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attached table describes Area Melbourne East Job Clubs contracts, by the financial year in which they were signed. Against each contract is  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7951"> the total level of funding received, the total number of commencements registered and the consequent unit cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up until the end of 1994, Job Club contracts were awarded on a calendar year rather than a financial year basis. Accordingly, Job Clubs are listed by the financial year in which they were contracted. However, a proportion (which cannot be quantified) of the contracts' expenditure and commencements contracted in one year may actually take place in the following financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "total outcomes" data provided are those known as positive outcomes, i.e. those former Job Club participants who found employment or chose to undertake non&hyphen;Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs funded education or training, and which were identified through the Department's Post Program Monitoring (PPM) survey. Not all former LMP participants return their PPM survey forms and, therefore, any outcome figures quoted will not relate strictly to all former clients who have participated in an LMP. The percentage of Job Club positive outcomes in the attached tables can only be reliably stated at Area level because the proportion of known client outcomes at the provider level is often too low to be statistically robust.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr Costello</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The net public sector borrowing requirement has fluctuated significantly over the past two decades, so the trend figures are not meaningful. As the Commonwealth public sector borrowing requirement includes the effect of asset sales and repayment of State debt it has not been a useful indicator of the impact of the public sector on national savings in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) There has been a clear trend increase in Commonwealth General Government debt, the component which arises mainly from Commonwealth Budget deficit. This is now the largest component of public sector debt.</PARA>
<PARA><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) In the past 30 years private sector net lending (private saving less private investment) has fluctuated widely over the course of the business cycle. As shown in Chart 17 of Statement 2 of 1996-97 Budget Paper No. 1, there have been periods of both significant net lending and net borrowing. After allowing for cyclical sensitivities, private investment has remained a fairly constant proportion of GDP. Private saving also remained reasonably steady as a proportion of GDP up to the early 1980s but since then has shown a gradual trend decline. This has been more than accounted for by a decline in household saving, offset partly by an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increase in corporate saving, including private financial enterprise saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No public sector balance data are currently available on an inflation&hyphen;adjusted, cyclically corrected basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The OECD Economic Outlook provides data on financial balances and net financial liabilities for the total general government sector for selected OECD member countries. While the OECD does adjust data in an attempt to improve comparability between countries, there remains the need to exercise caution in making cross&hyphen;country comparisons, as methods of data collection, coverage and classification can differ between countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the early 1990s the general government deficit in Australia exceeded the OECD average over a few years. Despite growth in the economy since then, Australia's fiscal position remained in deficit at 2&half; per cent of GDP in 1995. Labor left Australia with the highest current account deficit in the OECD, and this imbalance between national savings and investment must be addressed by boosting national savings. Commonwealth budget deficits in recent years have been a major source of the poor national savings performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to Australia's levels of gross and net debt, it is the pace at which net debt levels have built up in recent years&mdash;particularly in the Commonwealth general government sector&mdash;that has required corrective action. A series of large budget deficits over recent years has resulted in Commonwealth general government net debt rising from around 4 per cent of GDP in 1989&hyphen;90 to over 19 per cent of GDP in 1995-96. Without corrective action Commonwealth general government net debt would remain broadly unchanged as a proportion of GDP, with a high probability of ratcheting up further in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Commonwealth general government sector has generally been in deficit in underlying terms over the past two decades reflecting a generally significant dissaving position. A dissaving position by the Commonwealth general government sector means that it is reducing the level of public sector net worth and therefore potentially disadvantaging future generations.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON>

<ANSWER PAGE="7965" SPEAKER="Downer, Alexander, MP" NAMEID="4G4" ELECTORATE="Mayo" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Foreign Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr Downer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Lao government has identified hydropower as its primary resource to provide revenue to develop the country. The Hydropower Project Office (HPO) has the responsibility of assessing commercial proposals to develop hydropower in Laos. Given Laos' status as a "least developed country" the HPO lacks education, skills and experience to properly assess the hydropower proposals to ensure that the people of Laos receive a fair return from the utilisation of a major national resource, and that all environmental, social, legal and technical concerns are met. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) approached AusAID and sought Australian participation in an assistance program aimed at upgrading the skills levels of HPO personnel and at establishing a system that will allow hydropower proposals to be properly assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically Australian assistance is in two parts. Firstly, AusAID is funding, through UNDP, a full time "Power Development Adviser" at the HPO. Secondly, AusAID is directly funding a number of short term advisers and training programs for HPO staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) There is only one full time AusAID funded position at the HPO, the "Power Development Adviser". This Long Term Adviser assists the HPO to plan and manage the appropriate development of hydropower in Laos, taking account of all relevant environmental, social, legal and technical factors. The Long Term Adviser has four specific functions:  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to advise the HPO on the planning of power sector development for Laos; to advise the HPO on the financing options and ownership arrangements for power schemes;  to advise the HPO on the further development of individual power schemes; and to identify specific HPO needs for short term specialist assistance and training in legal, financial, and technical fields, and assist in the identification and selection of expert sources of this specialist assistance and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">AusAID&hyphen;funded short term advisers include a financial adviser, a costing engineer, an environment adviser and a legal adviser, with assignments of between one and two months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Cost Engineer's assignment was to develop a common format for the presentation of costing information by the proponents of commercial hydropower schemes, and to establish a computerised data base and train HPO personnel in its use. The assignment was successfully completed. There were no "findings" as such.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Yes. The report is available.</PARA>
<PARA><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7966"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) No. The Cost Engineer had a specific assignment which has been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The full time Power Development Adviser is contracted to the UNDP and he reports to them. AusAID receives copies of his reports. The short term advisers provide a report to AusAID on their activities at the completion of their assignments. AusAID personnel in Vientiane monitor the project and have regular contact with the advisers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) AusAID maintains close working relationships with companies implementing Australian aid projects in Laos. This included Transfield Constructions which was contracted, through a tender process, to be the construction manager of a project to build 4 bridges in a remote area in north&hyphen;eastern Laos. The Tasmanian Hydroelectric Commission Enterprises Corporation does not implement any AusAID projects in Laos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) The project is ongoing and the final cost has yet to be determined. The total cost of the AusAID contribution to the project is estimated to be $1.0 million.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
