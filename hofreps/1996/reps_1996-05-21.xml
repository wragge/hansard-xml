<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YU5">Mr TANNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I refer the minister to his reported comments on ABC radio of March 13 this year, which were that Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek needed to be `up and running as quickly as possible because that will further help reduce the noise problem of Sydneysiders'. Can he guarantee that his decision announced today to consider Holsworthy as an alternative site will not substantially delay construction of Sydney West airport?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="919" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can say to the House that the decision today to run a parallel environmental impact study of both Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy is designed to give a guarantee to the people of Sydney that a second airport for Sydney&mdash;a Sydney West airport&mdash;will be constructed as quickly as possible. The whole purpose of what the government has announced today is to overcome the problem of the legacy of the previous government's delaying of the construction of a second airport for Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting&mdash;and honourable members need to note this&mdash;that the previous government put all of its eggs into the one basket over Badgerys Creek. Indeed, it initiated an environmental impact study in January of this year. Had that proceeded, it could have raised the possibility that Badgerys Creek was an unacceptable site for an airport from an environmental point of view. Had that been the case, and with all your eggs invested in the one basket, it would have meant further delay to the construction of a second airport for Sydney. Our actions are designed to guarantee that, if an environmental impact study on Badgerys Creek proves a negative outcome from an environmental point of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> view, this government has an alternative to move to without further delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing the people of Sydney are sick and tired of is further delay in constructing a second airport for Sydney. The reason they are concerned is that the delay in the construction of a second airport for Sydney further imposes more unnecessary aircraft noise over their heads. Our decision today is designed to give us a fallback position in case that environmental impact study provides us with an environmentally unacceptable outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I reiterate to the House that it is this government's first priority to develop an airport at Badgerys Creek. We are determined to proceed with a second airport for Sydney. Our first priority is Badgerys Creek. This will minimise any further delay in the settlement of that outcome.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister: what action is the government taking to implement its election pledge to amend the Native Title Act to ensure its workability and to ensure that Aboriginal people, pastoralists and miners have new certainty in dealing with the difficult questions surrounding the whole issue?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the House will be aware that there is a lot of concern throughout the Australian community regarding the operation of the Native Title Act in its current form. In the election campaign the coalition parties committed themselves to a number of things. We said that we would retain the Native Title Act, and we will. We said that we would reserve the right to propose amendments to the Native Title Act to ensure its workability, and we will. We also said that we would respect the principles of the Racial Discrimination Act, and we will. In the next little while the government will be circulating a lengthy discussion paper&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To complete the last of that trilogy, we said that we would honour the principles of the Racial Discrimination Act, and we will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will shortly circulate a discussion paper that contains a number of options. Those options will not include a proposal through legislation to extinguish native title. The options will, however, include a number of proposals to address the unworkable features of the Native Title Act. One of the greatest and most legitimate complaints that I have heard from people in the mining industry and the pastoral industry is the proliferation of the practice whereby unsubstantial and vexatious claims are made across wide areas of land which have the effect of gumming up any prospect of early development. Because of the construction of the existing act, those claims trigger the right to negotiate principles under the existing legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the options that will be proposed will result in a significant curtailment of the right to negotiate procedures under the existing legislation. I might remind the House that the right to negotiate procedures was not mandated by the decision of the High Court of Australia in Mabo No. 2 v. the State of Queensland, and the right to negotiate procedures of the existing act is unknown to other forms of common law title that exist in Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion that any option to propose a more stringent approach to the right to negotiate would be taking a right away from native title holders which has not been taken away from the holders of other common law titles in Australia would not be a valid argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very difficult issue and there are strongly held opinions right across the political spectrum. I dare say there are people in the Labor Party who feel uneasy about the existing Native Title Act; there are certainly a lot of people in the coalition parties who believe it must be amended to make it more workable. And in proposing the options that we do propose we are responding to the concerns of pastoralists and the mining industry. We recognise that the economic future of this country depends on resource <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="920"> development and upon getting a set of laws which do not allow people who do not have substantial claims to stall development for years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complaints that are legitimately made about the present Native Title Act are that it is so widely cast, so cumbersome in its procedures and has so added to the original intent of the Mabo decision that it is being used by some in the community as an instrument to obstruct and delay legitimate development in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something that must be addressed. We are going to try to address it in a way which respects the principles of the act and respects the survival of native title as decreed by the High Court of Australia in its decision but which does not give to the putative claimants of native title rights to obstruct, delay and obfuscate that are not available to the putative claimants of other common law titles throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that that is a very effective way of responding to a difficult issue. The discussion paper we are putting out obviously is what it is called&mdash;a discussion paper. It indicates the disposition of the government at present. We invite people who are interested&mdash;including state governments and others in the community&mdash;to respond, and I hope that the legislation which follows from that process is legislation that can enjoy the support of the entire House.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="R36">Mr ALBANESE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Is the minister aware that for the six&hyphen;month period from November 1995 to April 1996, as compared with the 12&hyphen;month period previously, there was a 9.6 per cent growth in aircraft movements at Sydney airport? Can the minister guarantee that the existing curfew and cap on aircraft movements at Sydney airport will remain in place over the next five years?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government when in opposition made a commitment to impose a cap of 80 aircraft movements per hour for Sydney airport. That is a commitment that we made in opposition and that we will now <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fulfil in government, as indeed we have in regard to a number of other commitments relating to Sydney airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the honourable gentleman raises the question of a curfew for Sydney airport. It is worth while reminding the House that the person who introduced legislation into this chamber to enforce that curfew through legislation is the now Prime Minister of Australia. Through that bill and the pressure that it imposed on the parliament, the Prime Minister gave to the people of Sydney&mdash;for the very first time&mdash;a guarantee through legislation that their curfew would be in place through the legislative process. I can answer the question proposed by the honourable gentleman by saying yes, the cap for aircraft movements will remain, as our commitment stated it would, and indeed the legislation surrounding the curfew and the consequences of that legislation will remain.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to the current disposition of the opposition and the minority parties in the Senate to delay, at least until 20 August, a vote on the Telstra privatisation legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it raises a very interesting question, and that is that we have been told by the Australian Democrats since the election that there are no circumstances in which the Australian Democrats will vote in favour of a one&hyphen;third privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the case, then I think the Australian people are entitled to ask, `Why on earth are they wasting the time and money of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="921"> Australian Senate to have a committee inquiry  into something they say they have already made up their minds on?' The Australian Democrats apparently want until 20 August to dream up some excuse to the environmentalists of Australia as to why they are going to vote down the best environmental package this country has seen since World War II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No amount of bobbing and weaving and procedural devices by the Australian Democrats can alter the fact that only one issue is at stake in this Telstra legislation: are you for or against a good environmental package? We on this side of the House are in favour of a good environmental package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The longer this debate goes on, more and more the Australian people are going to ask: why is it that the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens are against cleaning up the River Murray? Why is it that the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party are against cleaning up water pollution? Why is it that the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party are against doing something about ocean outfall?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Given your encouragement and plans for a new international airport at Holsworthy with several 5,000&hyphen;metre runways, what consideration have you given to the fact that: Holsworthy is directly surrounded by 500,000 residents in the south&hyphen;west Sydney arc from Bankstown to Liverpool to Campbelltown; that thousands of young home buyers have recently purchased homes in Holsworthy&mdash;homes that you will now have to acquire; and that the last time your department made an assessment of Sydney's second airport needs Holsworthy was ranked second last out of 10 options due to its close prox <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> imity to residential areas, its high cost, environmental concerns and the large number of unexploded bombs on the military site?</PARA></TALK.START>

<ANSWER PAGE="921" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the honourable gentleman that the government's first priority is to develop an airport to resolve the aircraft noise problems of Sydney. I can also assure the House that the government's first priority is to develop Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental impact studies that were done in 1985, which the honourable gentleman referred to in his question, highlighted a number of factors. It also needs to be remembered that in 1985 when Badgerys Creek was being considered for selection as a possible site for a second airport it was in a country area without much urban development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members would be aware that since 1985 urban development has moved rapidly into the Badgerys Creek area, particularly under the flight paths that would exist if an airport was constructed at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the honourable gentleman who asked the question looks at an overall map of Holsworthy, he will note that Holsworthy offers something quite unique for any of these sites. That is, it offers flight paths to and from the south that are over uninhabited areas, which is something that cannot be said about Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I also deal with the specific instances that the honourable gentleman referred to in relation to Holsworthy. There were two issues of concern in the 1985 EIS selection process in relation to Holsworthy. The first was unexploded ordnance, or bombs as he prefers to call them, and the second was the terrain.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="922">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the first issue of unexploded ordnance, members of the House need to be aware that since 1985 technology has moved on. We are advised that the unexploded ordnance problem is no longer a reason not to consider Holsworthy as a possible site for a second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both sites, either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy, have major engineering problems in relation to terrain. Badgerys Creek is not billiard table flat. Both sites have problems. Both sites will be considered in a proper environmental impact study and a judgment will be made following the completion of that study as to the correct decision for this government to make on developing a second airport for Sydney to alleviate aircraft noise problems for Sydney residents.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, Mr Speaker. On 13 March, Alan Ramsey wrote an article entitled `A surplus&mdash;of Labor fantasy'. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Keating, Willis and Beazley, as the key co&hyphen;conspirators, went through the election campaign telling people Labor's day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day handling of the economy was in surplus and would remain in surplus.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is what is known in acceptable parliamentary language as an "untruth".</PARA>
<PARA>We now know the real reason for the deficit. The shadow Treasurer yesterday, while musing on the fact that there is a deficit in the economy, told the people of Australia and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="923"> people of this House that there is a reason for it. What he said is quite illuminating. He asked a rhetorical question:</PARA>

<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me answer it by saying it is not a product of mismanagement . . . it is a product of deliberate policy choice.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the answer given by the shadow Treasurer, that the deficit is a product of deliberate policy choice. The people of Australia would like to know whether the foreign debt which blew out under Labor from $23 billion to $185 billion was a product of deliberate policy choice. What we have inherited is the responsibility to clear that deficit. That is why the Australian people put us in government, to make sure that we take the pressure off interest rates, give small business a chance to increase growth in employment, and give the economy a chance to grow. That is why Labor was thrown out.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is on track to introduce the legislation very shortly. It has been a significant task to translate the coalition's policy at the last election to an important piece of legislation for consideration by the House. We are obviously putting the finishing touches to that.

I particularly mention the MTAA as they have many small businesses within their constituency, as do other organisations. We have been very intent on ensuring that our package is relevant, appropriate and easy for small business, because they have had to deal with the com plexities of Labor's scheme for many years. As a result, when people see the bill, they will see that one of its many great advantages is its operation as far as it affects small business.

It would be a breach of our responsibility if we did not impress upon the Senate that the Australian people have supported this legislation.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an absolute nonsense to say that we are gutting the commission. Those who argue that are really saying that there should be absolutely no change to the commission. It is all the more absurd because the argument which is run on this is that, because we want to simplify the award system, that equals gutting the commission. The opposition, in particular Mr Keating in 1993, advanced the very argument for simplification that we are now advancing and you never heard anybody on their side saying, `Simplification equals gutting the commission.' It does not. Yes, it is changing the role of the commission, but the world is changing; Australia is changing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems under the last government was that they were not prepared to make the changes to allow Australians to get on and meet the challenges of that very change. In fact, it is our policy to make a series of changes to the commission. In some respects we are actually enhancing the role of the commission. Take awards, for example: we want awards to be simplified, but we also want them to be a genuine protection for people. If there is a breach of an award under proposals in the government's policy, we will increase the penalties for breaching awards. Those penalties have not changed for 20 years and we are going to bring them up to play a fair role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also going to provide expressly for the commission to have a role as a mediator and we will ensure that the commission, on the consent of the parties, can make recommendations to assist parties with their employee relations. That actually will be an enhanced role for the commission.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="926">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will be given greater power to resolve industrial disputes. In particular, the commission will be empowered to issue directions preventing or stopping industrial action. For those opposite who claim to be advocates of the commission, instead of canning that policy they ought to be supporting it. It is in the public interest that the commission, within the confines of the policy that we are advancing, should have a proper and reasonable power to deal with industrial disputes. The commission will also continue to be responsible for resolving intractable disputes where bargaining for a certified agreement threatens essential services or the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to members opposite that they should also reflect on the fact that the claim by the ACTU that it views the commission as an independent umpire is nonsense. The truth of the matter is that in Australian industrial relations for many years the unions only supported the role of the commission in so far as it supported the privileges of unions. That is not supporting the commission as an independent umpire. That is simply supporting their own vested interest. Unions have regularly defied the decisions of the commission when they disagreed with them. The Novacoal dispute, which has been in the press recently, is the latest case in point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACTU opposes the commission's role in the resolution of demarcation disputes, a view now dutifully shared by the shadow minister for industrial relations. One only has to think back to the storm of abuse which was directed at the commission by both the previous Labor government and the ACTU at the time of the 1991 national wage case to understand just how spurious is the Labor movement's respect for the commission. They have a feigned respect, not a real respect, for the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have a respect for the commission and we have a proper role for the commission in a modern industrial relations system. That is why the claim that we are gutting the commission is absolute nonsense. Yes, its role is changing, but I believe that its role needs to change if we are to make the changes to the system to give people a chance of a job <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the future and, most importantly and unlike during Labor's 13 years, to give people a chance of earning more in the future.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

In your answer yesterday, Minister, you said that the proposed job cuts were due to the so-called $8 billion deficit. That same Customs minute shows this to be incorrect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is the minister aware of recent comments concerning the impact of the government's policy of abolishing the existing restrictions on new schools? What would be the effect of the government's policy on public sector spending?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="929" SPEAKER="Kemp, Dr David, MP" NAMEID="BT4" ELECTORATE="Goldstein" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Schools, Vocational Education and Training" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Swan for his question. I have seen in the press this morning comments on the impact of the removal of the existing bureaucratic restrictions on the establishment of non&hyphen;government schools on government spending.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's commitment to abolish the Labor Party's new schools policy is one of our longest standing policy commitments. The government believes that parents should be able to exercise freedom of choice in the school to which they send their children, whether that school is in the government or the non&hyphen;government sector. Furthermore, the government acknowledges that there is a public benefit in the education of all children and that it is therefore appropriate for public funding to be made available, regardless of the parents' choice.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="930">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new schools policy was established by the former government in 1985 to restrict parents in the exercise of their choice. It was called at the time the `no new schools' policy, and there are several things that I want to say to the House about this policy. Firstly, it failed in its principal object. In the 15 years between 1970 and 1985, before Labor introduced the new schools policy, the percentage of students in non&hyphen;government schools increased from 22 per cent to 25.8 per cent. In the 10 years of the new schools policy, from 1986 to 1996, the percentage increased from 26.4 per cent to 29.4 per cent, a faster rate of increase than before the policy was established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as can be determined, therefore, the policy has affected this trend, if at all, only at the margins. But there is little doubt, firstly, that it has pushed up fees for those parents least able to afford them and it has therefore operated in a socially inequitable manner. Secondly, the policy has imposed a huge bureaucratic set of arrangements which have caused frustrations and costly delays of up to two years or more for parents wishing to establish new schools. Other community agencies and churches have been equally frustrated by these bureaucratic restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are now in the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs eight people whose role it is to administer the policy. They service committees in states and territories that also involve people from state government and non&hyphen;government school organisations. They sit down for one month of every year, trying to prioritise the applications that have come before the committees. It is red tape and duplication of the states' services gone mad, and all because some parents want to exercise their freedom of choice for their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be clear about this: it costs the taxpayer less when a child is educated in a non&hyphen;government school. I have been advised that the estimate is a saving to state budgets of an average of $1,800 per child.</PARA>

We will remember that, and every member of this House will remember that. You think freedom of choice is babble. All right!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me be quite clear on this point: the government has no policy about the appropriate size of the government and non&hyphen;government school sectors. I want to remind all members of this House of the government's commitment to quality government school sectors. The distinction between the two sectors is perhaps becoming less important as time goes by, but the relative size of the two sectors is determined by the choices that parents make and the financial incentives that exist for parents to select a government school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle of freedom of choice is increasingly recognised in all sectors as an important accountability principle, and it is being pursued now by a number of state governments within the government school systems. The government's policy will open up desirable, largely low&hyphen;fee options for lower income parents. I understand that the Anglican church is keen to move into this area of school provision.</PARA>

In the Senate on 30 November last year Senator Parer, the then shadow minister for aviation, stated, `The development of Badgerys Creek should go ahead.' In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  on 16 February this year, in an article titled `Liberals look at making Badgerys main airport', it was made plain that the Liberal Party was committed not only to building Badgerys but also to making it the No. 1 airport in the Sydney region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a few weeks after the election we had broadly a similar line emerging from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and other members of the government. On ABC radio on 13 March the minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want to build a second Sydney airport, we want to build one that is capable of handling all international aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA>He also stated:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="934">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The challenge for us is to minimise the impact of noise and to spread that noise impact more equitably and that's what we're trying to do by the reopening of the East-West runway, the selection of new flight paths, and obviously trying to get Sydney West Airport constructed in Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA>I specifically draw the House's attention to those last words in that quote. Subsequently, in the same interview, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development stated that, with respect to the government's commitment to Badgerys Creek, they were committed to `getting Sydney West airport up and running as quickly as we can'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> So far so good. Up until that stage it appeared that the government was sticking to the commitment to Badgerys Creek that had been established by the previous government and which it had stated numerous times prior to the election that it was going to maintain. Then things started to get a bit murky. Then we had a little speculation floating up about Goulburn&mdash;very fast trains that just happened to be in the minister's electorate. It was 200 kilometres from Sydney; nonetheless, it was a serious possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there were a few hints about Newcastle and that maybe that would be a good place to have a second airport for Sydney. Then there were one or two rumours about Holsworthy, and the true agenda started to float to the surface. Yesterday on 2UE Alan Jones, in an interview with the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So therefore the delay caused by the new environmental impact statement could be a good thing which enables you, particularly, to take a realistic view of all the social costs and perhaps knock the thing on the head?</PARA>
<PARA>The `thing' of course was the Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. The minister's response was, `That certainly could be the case, Alan.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the agenda starts to become clear. What was a clear, strong commitment on the part of the coalition prior to the election, and even for a few weeks after the election, suddenly gets a bit cloudy. Then we hear the litany of excuses gradually flowing from the minister as to why they have changed their position&mdash;`The runways are too short. There is not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enough capacity for the proposed Badgerys Creek airport. It is not flat.' What a surprise! I think the term was `rugged terrain' or `undulating terrain'. He said that it will require a fair amount of cut and fill works. I would be surprised if there were too many places near Sydney that would not require cut and fill works to construct an airport. Apparently that is a major problem at Badgerys. He also said, `There are access problems. You need road and rail links. They have to be constructed. That is costly. There are other cost issues involved. There are problems with the prospective flight paths.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hardly surprising, in the wake of this litany of problems the minister was putting forward, that Mr Jones concluded at the end of the program that there will be no airport built at Badgerys Creek. Maybe the minister got cut off at that point, but it was noticeable in the transcript that there was no response from the minister to that concluding statement by Mr Jones.</PARA>

Is the minister expecting us to believe that he has become aware of these aspects of the Badgerys Creek development over only the past few weeks? Is he expecting us to believe that he knew about some of the issues that he raised in this interview within only the last few days? Does he expect us to believe that he had not realised Badgerys Creek was going to require substantial investment in road and rail links and that he did not know the Badgerys Creek site was not flat?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does he expect us to believe that these things have been brought to his attention only in the past few weeks? Does he expect us to believe that he did not know there were some serious issues about flight paths and that some difficult choices would have to be made? Does he expect us to believe that he was completely unaware of these things?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did he expect us to believe? What does he expect us to think was his development of policy in this area? Maybe he thinks we should believe that he hopped into the Range Rover at some stage, maybe last weekend, whacked on the Akubra and the RM <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="935"> Williams, went down to have a look for himself, got out the binoculars, checked around and said, `Oh, gee; this doesn't look like such a great place for an airport. It's got a lot of rugged terrain.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the National Party can be a bit amateurish at times. They have been out of government for a fair while and they occasionally have cowboy type people in some important positions. But it defies credibility to suggest that the minister was unaware, until the last few days, of these aspects of the proposed development at Badgerys Creek&mdash;that he did not know these sorts of things were problems and that obstacles had to be overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he gave his interview on ABC radio on 13 March, there was no mention of these sorts of problems. None of these obstacles was dealt with. It was full steam ahead: `Badgerys Creek, we're committed. The former government were wimps. The former government were only half&hyphen;hearted about it. They weren't really serious. They wanted only a little one. We want a fully&hyphen;fledged second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He knew at that stage about the obstacles involved with building Badgerys Creek. He knew about the need for road and rail development. He knew about the cost. He knew that there would be a bit of earthmoving required. So why was he so committed a couple of months ago and why is he now backing away? The story seems to change about every half an hour. He is now using the term `fall back'. He wants Holsworthy as a fall back option. I do not think he used that term in his press conference today. It will be interesting to see whether it is in there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> He wants Holsworthy as a fall back option. This is in spite of the fact that, when the Labor government examined all the options which led to the choice of Badgerys Creek over 10 years ago, Holsworthy finished second last out of 10 options. It did not even make the cut. He wants Holsworthy as a fall back option, in spite of the environmental problems associated there and the fact that the terrain at Holsworthy is even more rugged than the terrain at Badgerys Creek. It is full of ravines and gorges. In spite of the exist ence of numerous unexploded bombs on the site, Holsworthy is going to be the fall back option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did the minister or anybody else in the coalition mention prior to the election anything of this to voters in electorates like Hughes? Did any of those voters know that part of the prospect of electing a coalition government might involve this? No, they did not. I can suggest a few serious reasons why this is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is money for budget cuts. It was calculated that Badgerys would cost $83 million in 1996-97 and $73 million in 1997-98. So here is a bit of money those opposite can get by not having to spend it on the Badgerys proposal and slowing everything down on every other front. Secondly, it sends the second airport for Sydney off into the never-never. They can still pretend that they are committed to doing it and going ahead with it by saying to the people around KSA, `Don't worry. We're looking after you. We're going to build Sydney's second airport but just not quite yet.' Thirdly, they are letting the real agenda come through, which is basically to expand Kingsford Smith airport, to get rid of the curfew, to get rid of the cap and to have no second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very significant that yesterday two people from absolute opposite ends of the spectrum on these issues, Chris Brown from the Tourism Task Force, which does not want Badgerys built, and the New South Wales Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning, Mr Knowles, both agreed that this meant that there would be no second airport for Sydney. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we are likely to have a Lindsay by-election in the near future or the fact that Badgerys Creek is now surrounded by a number of marginal Liberal electorates and there are more safe Labor electorates around Holsworthy. Perhaps there are a few little political whiffs in there as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we consider what has happened with respect to Kingsford Smith and the fact that Liberal&hyphen;National Party policy with respect to Kingsford Smith was essentially based on the need to get aircraft away from Bennelong and to give them some chance of winning Lowe, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="936"> perhaps we should not be too surprised. Perhaps we should not be too surprised that policy is being developed based on putting the airport where it largely affects only safe Labor seats&mdash;maybe Hughes but mostly safe Labor seats&mdash;and making sure they hang onto seats like Macarthur, Lindsay and the rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real agenda is to keep putting off the second airport, let pressure from the Olympics gradually build up and put the government in a position where it has no choice but to get rid of the cap and the curfew at Kingsford Smith airport. The political pressure from within the community to make sure that the Olympics are successful and that we do not have transport chaos, including with the airlines, at that time will be considerable. So the minister and the government are setting up a situation where ultimately the people who live near Kingsford Smith airport will suffer substantially as a result of these decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strategy is pretty straightforward. First, you cast a bit of doubt on Badgerys by saying, `Oh, no. There's all these obstacles. There's all these problems. It's pretty hard and it's very expensive.' Then suddenly the estimates of how much it is going to cost start multiplying. None of this was there before the election, of course. Then you float Goulburn, then you float Newcastle, then you suddenly insert Holsworthy, which did not pass the cut 10 or 12 years ago, and you slow things down a bit more. Maybe they will eventually get to Dubbo. There is still a chance. Dubbo is in there with a show of being the second airport for Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequences of this backflip are, first, that the last hope of having a second airport for the Olympics has gone. The Liberals half killed it by stopping the funding through the Senate when they stopped the sale of airport leases in the Senate which was needed to fund Badgerys. Second, the retention of the cap and the curfew is now under serious threat. The minister has told us he wants to share the pain at Kingsford Smith airport. Now we know why&mdash;there is going to be a lot more pain to go around. The potential jobs in western Sydney from a second airport are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now under threat. Road developments that link different parts of Sydney will be abandoned. The sale of the lease at Kingsford Smith airport has been thrown into further confusion because that will be put back again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister cannot even seem to get his head around when the decision is going to be. Yesterday he told Alan Jones that he will make a decision in a few weeks time. His representative said in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that it would be within 12 months of the Badgerys' EIS. We are told today that there will be a decision after competing EISs and a comparative study. When the minister was asked in question time today whether there would be as a result of his decisions extra delay in the development of the second airport at Sydney west, he did not answer. All he said was, `We're committed to building a second airport as soon as possible.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We probably had better give the coalition, now in government as well as when they were opposition, some credit for consistency in aviation policy. They are consistently inconsistent, consistently hypocritical and consistently very confused. Labor was committed to building a second airport and had committed money to doing so. It had made that subject to an environmental impact statement in order to ensure that concerns with respect to noise, environmental factors and the like could be properly taken account of. Until the Liberals intervened through the Senate, we were on track to build such an airport in time for the Olympics and in time to make sure that Sydney will be able to cope with the massive influx of tourists that the Olympics will inevitably produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the Liberals in contrast. We all remember them in the late 1980s. Some of us were not in this place at the time, but in the late 1980s they were gung-ho advocates for the third runway, with John Howard leading the charge. When the government started to do something about it, they then changed their minds, saying, `Oh, no. This is terrible. This is going to produce all sorts of appalling consequences.' They were also gung-ho advocates for privatisation. They thought privatising airports was a great idea&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="937">and privatising everything would be a great idea. But when the government started to do it and started to sell leases to the airports what did the Liberals do? They blocked that in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had a situation where they supported building a second airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek to take the pressure off Kingsford Smith airport and to make sure that people in the inner suburbs have a reasonable lifestyle. But, now that they are in government and they have a chance to do something about it, what do they do? They back away, obfuscate, put things off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the government are not committed to building a second airport for Sydney. They do not want to spend the money. They do not care about the residents around Sydney airport. They do not want to confront the practical obstacles that are involved in getting a second airport up and running as quickly as possible. This latest device is a transparent device to ensure that they can let the whole issue just drag on for a few more years and that they will not have to spend much money. They will just chop and change here and there, slide around a little and wriggle out from underneath their commitments to avoid investing in new airport infrastructure for Sydney and get to a point where the impending Olympics will give them the excuse they want to wriggle out of their commitments to look after the people who are living with great difficulties around Kingsford Smith airport.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it amazing that members of the Labor Party could get up in this place and speak with any credibility on the subject of the handling of Sydney's airport problems, given their complete and utter failure over the last 13 years to deal with the very vexed questions of how to resolve the siting of the second airport and how to handle the management of aircraft noise over the heads of Sydneysiders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question in the minds of just about everybody in Sydney today as to who is to blame for the problems the coalition government inherited&mdash;the problems of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aircraft noise and of the failure to develop a second airport for Sydney. The people in Sydney know that the truth is that the former Labor government&mdash;and their members stand in the House today pretending that they have some credibility in this area&mdash;is to blame for the problems we inherited on 2 March when we entered government after 13 years of Labor rule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is extraordinary that the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), stood up here today and expressed concerns about the status of Sydney's second airport and the aircraft noise problems, given the track record of Labor. They had 13 years in government and they failed to deal with this issue adequately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to note that the subject we are discussing today&mdash;that is, the second airport for Sydney&mdash;has been the subject of discussion and debate in this House for nearly 30 years. In recent years, it has been the subject of considerably more debate following the 1985 decision by the former Labor government to undertake an environmental impact study of 10 sites in the Sydney region that would be considered for the second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In February 1986 the then government announced, following an EIS, that Badgerys Creek was the preferred site for a second airport for Sydney. It is interesting to note that at that time Badgerys Creek was not situated amongst a residential area, and the possible flight paths for an airport at Badgerys Creek would not have caused the occupants of houses under those paths the inconvenience and the aircraft noise that many of those people who live in the western parts of Sydney now endure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In February 1986 a judgment from the government of the day said that Badgerys Creek was the best site. The government then proceeded to vacillate, to wax and to wane and to obfuscate when it came to providing reasons for the delay in construction of the airport at Badgerys Creek. In March 1989 they finally announced a staged development of Badgerys Creek and claimed that Badgerys Creek would be developed with a runway in operation by June 1995. So, after selecting the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="938"> site in 1986 and spending three years delaying any further work on it, they finally announced a staged development of Badgerys Creek that would see the airport in operation by June 1995. Of course, we have gone beyond June 1995 and nothing has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As concerns started to rise about aircraft problems and aircraft noise in Sydney, the then government showed fresh interest in Badgerys Creek. In December 1993, the former minister for transport, Senator Bob Collins, turned the first sod, amongst much media attention, at Badgerys Creek airport. A little while later&mdash;only a few days later, in fact&mdash;Senator Collins was no longer the minister for transport, and the member for Kingsford-Smith, Mr Brereton, was appointed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been pointed out, it is important for members of the House to understand the history of this. If you understand the history of this, you will realise the hypocrisy shown by the people sitting opposite us today when they talk about possible delays to the development of the second airport in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In December 1993 Laurie Brereton was appointed the Minister for Transport. Then, in March 1994, he decided that there would be an initial cutting ceremony for the site at Badgerys Creek and a special commemorative plaque was commissioned. All of that was due to take place on 10 March 1994. But that was cancelled. On 25 March another ceremony was organised for the initial cutting, and the minister dutifully appeared on top of a bulldozer to mark the beginning of the construction of the so&hyphen;called Badgerys Creek airport. In May 1994 the government of the day announced through its Working Nation statement that they would build a 2,900&hyphen;metre runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We have seen the history of it, and the consequence of that history has been that we have seen a great deal of indecision and a great deal of delay. The last announcement made by the Labor Party in May 1994 was an attempt by them to convince the people of Sydney that they were fast-tracking the airport and developing it to accommodate more than just the overflow capacity from Sydney's major airport at Mascot. Of course, that decision in May 1994 delayed the develop ment and completion of that airport until at least 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Late last year the then Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, announced further delays to the development of Badgerys Creek airport and admitted that the airport would not be completed until some time after the year 2000&mdash;15 years after the decision to site the second airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek and at least five years after the initial completion date was indicated by the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note all of that history because, when you note that history, you realise that the people sitting opposite us in the Labor Party have no credibility when they talk about delays, inconvenience and the possibility of settling this issue of a second airport for Sydney. When we were in opposition we made a clear commitment to the development of a second airport for Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said that, as part of that commitment, we would have an environmental impact study and that impact study would take into account the possibility of Badgerys Creek not being an environmentally suitable site. That is the commitment we made in opposition, and it is a commitment we fulfil today. I can assure the House this afternoon that the new government is determined to build a second airport for Sydney as quickly as possible and that attempts by the Labor Party to paint our announcement today as another reason for delay are totally wrong&mdash;totally and utterly wrong. We are determined, now more than ever, to build a second airport for Sydney as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for our decision today in announcing two parallel EISs is to overcome one of the major flaws we inherited from the previous federal government and that is, of course, the flaw that has been identified by many people living in western Sydney. I see the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) sitting here; she would be very much aware of the problems of Badgerys Creek. I have heard many complaints from elected representatives in the western and south&hyphen;western parts of Sydney talking about the problems in western Sydney.</PARA>

We are all aware of those problems, and we need to understand in the House today that the former Labor government put all of their eggs into the one basket called Badgerys Creek. If that environmental impact study that was to be undertaken by the former government and which is to be undertaken now by this government proved that Badgerys Creek was not an acceptable site from an environmental point of view, what would this government have done if they had not considered another site in the process?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would the opposition have done if Badgerys Creek had been proven to be environmentally unacceptable? They would have had to go back to square one again. What would that have resulted in? Further delays and further inconvenience for people who suffer aircraft noise as a result of Kingsford Smith airport flight paths. What this government has decided to do is take out some insurance, if you would like to call it that. Our insurance is a position whereby, if an environmental impact study to be undertaken on Badgerys Creek proves that it is environmentally unacceptable to build an airport there, we can move to an alternative site straightaway, without any further delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Labor government were still in power today, the net consequence of that environmental impact study proving that Badgerys Creek was environmentally unacceptable would have resulted in further delays. As a consequence, we would have seen more inconvenience to people living in Sydney. This government is not causing delays; it is indeed taking out insurance against any delays as a consequence of an environmental impact study for Badgerys Creek. Our first preference, our first priority, our first order, is to develop Badgerys Creek. Within the possibility of Badgerys Creek being proven to be environmentally unacceptable, we will be able to move to an alternative site without further delay. For people to say that this is a delaying tactic is totally and utterly wrong because we are totally and utterly determined to develop an airport&mdash;a second airport for Sydney&mdash;as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a matter raised by the honourable member for Melbourne, in his address to the House this afternoon, in relation to the possibility of expanding Sydney airport. Indeed, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) also questioned whether we will lift the cap on aircraft movements per hour at Sydney's Mascot airport because of the impending Olympic Games. Can I say to the House today that we are committed to the maintenance of that 80 aircraft movements per hour at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. We are as committed today as we were in opposition. We are also committed to the curfews that were initiated as a consequence of John Howard's private member's legislation that was moved last year by him and which instilled that curfew in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also committed to not building another runway at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport, which is the implication of what the honourable member for Melbourne was saying in his MPI address today. We are committed to one thing, and one thing only, and that is the construction, as quickly as possible, of a second airport for Sydney to alleviate its aircraft noise problems. Our track record in this area is, I believe, first&hyphen;class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were elected to office we said, as we had said in opposition, that within 10 working days of being sworn into government we would reopen the east-west runway; we did that as we had promised, and we did it, in fact, within eight days. We also said that we would have a more equitable distribution of the aircraft noise problem over Sydney if we were elected to office. That is precisely what we have done. We said in opposition, as we have done in government, that we would have a review of flight paths for Sydney's Mascot airport. And we have done that. We have initiated that process today. We have initiated that process since we were elected to office. In terms of all of the things that we said we would do&mdash;Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport, flight paths, a more equitable distribution of the noise problem over Sydney, and the reopening of the east-west runway&mdash;we have fulfilled our commitments and will continue to work towards achieving the fulfilment of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="940"> our commitments, just as we will continue to work for the development and completion of a second airport for Sydney because Sydneysiders have had a gutful of the delays caused by the former Labor government in developing this very important part of Sydney's infrastructure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fundamental mind&hyphen;set of the government is still one of opposition. They are knockers, they are not doers. They are now entrusted with the task of getting on with the job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first delay in the construction of Badgerys Creek was the need to upgrade the airport from a regional runway of 1,800 metres to a fully international runway of 2,900 metres. The Labor government saw the need to do that to cope with the obvious demand that will come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second delay occurred because the then opposition knocked over the funding base for Badgerys Creek with the rejection of the airport privatisation legislation. Despite that, $150 million was spent by the Labor government in the acquisition of sites and the development of infrastructure. It is false in the extreme to say that the former government dragged the chain on those developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present government's prevarication in building a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek is an excuse for doing just what big business want, namely, to expand the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The government is finding every possible reason not to proceed with a second Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has interrupted the fast&hyphen;tracking of Badgerys Creek, saying a more extensive environmental impact statement is required. The blatant hypocrisy stands out for all to see when the government has put planes over the homes and the schools of my electors in Barton and other electorates under the east&hyphen;west flight path without giving them the opportunity to have an input in their own environmental impact statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the government has the audacity to speak of the sanctity of the environmental impact statement when saying it may interfere with Badgerys Creek. Certainly they can make one interfere with the construction of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Badgerys Creek, and that is no doubt their hidden agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wants to derail a second Sydney airport by speculating on a second alternative. That is all it is, it is no more than speculation. As I stand here today on 21 May 1996, I state: the government will never go ahead with Badgerys Creek and it will never go ahead with an airport at Holsworthy. They are just false promises. The second site has been examined up hill and down dale and rejected unequivocally. As sure as night follows day, the government's deliberate delaying tactics will blow out the noise curfew and capping on hourly flight movements that exist at Kingsford Smith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is more so given the government's arrogant and irrational decision to reopen the east&hyphen;west runway at KSA which was referred to by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in the concluding parts of his speech. It is irrational because it significantly decreases the capacity of KSA. While the east&hyphen;west runway is operational, the north&hyphen;south runways are virtually closed. The north&hyphen;south parallel runways have a capacity of between 70 and 80 movements an hour. The east&hyphen;west runway has a safe capacity of approximately 20 movements an hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures speak for themselves. The reduction in capacity caused by the operation of the east&hyphen;west runway is acknowledged by the fact that the government can only use the east&hyphen;west runway during non&hyphen;peak periods. That is, it is putting planes over the homes of school children when our kids are trying to learn. And, again, when the kids come home of an evening, when parents are trying to put them to bed, the government has planes flying over our homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the government still has not silenced the complaints coming from the electorate of the member for Bennelong, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Even while the court case is taking place to challenge the government's decision on opening the east&hyphen;west runway, the government has arrogantly increased its hours of use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simply to placate the Bennelong voters, the government is pumping planes out from the east&hyphen;west runway to prove a point. There is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="941"> no doubt that many of those planes would otherwise be going out over the fish in Botany Bay rather than our homes and schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, despite a clear and unequivocal election promise, the government has not allocated one cent&mdash;not one cent!&mdash;to insulating our homes and schools under the east&hyphen;west flight path. And the government talks of election  promises. They are putting planes over our homes, but where is the money?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no doubt as to the trauma the government has caused the residents of Barton. I will read from a letter from the President of the Kyeemagh Public School Council. This was a desperate plea to the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The members of the School Council of Kyeemagh Infants School are concerned that with the reopening of the East&hyphen;West Runway at Kingsford&hyphen;Smith Airport, the noise from planes landing and taking off once again seriously disrupts the teaching/learning activities at Kyeemagh school.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to speak of the stresses, traumas and impediments to learning suffered as a result of the government's arrogant actions in opening the east&hyphen;west runway without an environmental impact statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not coming clean. All money for noise insulation has been allocated north of the airport and that has been tied up for three years. Unless there is a special allocation in this coming budget there will be no funds to insulate the homes under the east&hyphen;west flight path. I am an optimist but, unfortunately, I am not prepared to put a bet on the government honouring its election promises. Yet they stand up here with sanctity and self&hyphen;righteousness and say that what they are doing is honouring election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> By the year 2000 there will be 20 million passengers coming into Sydney airport and it simply does not have the capacity to handle it. So the curfew will be broken and there will be an increase in aircraft movements and a return to the simultaneous operation of cross&hyphen;runways. The simultaneous operation of cross&hyphen;runways has been universally acknowledged as significantly less safe than parallel runways. Between 1991 and 1993 there were five serious incidents involving aircraft at Kings ford Smith airport. In August 1991 there was a near collision involving an Ansett aircraft and a Thai Airways aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That event resulted in the Ansett aircraft having to take evasive action, missing the Thai aircraft by metres. The air traffic controllers reported to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation they were convinced a collision was about to occur. The firefighters had launched the alarm because they were convinced a collision was about to occur. If the government proceeds down this path it will compel all air travellers to face this risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has given a direction to Airservices Australia to maximise the use of the east&hyphen;west runway. We are starting to move very rapidly into a dangerous situation of cross&hyphen;runway operations. We are looking at the risk of a significant disaster&mdash;and not for any rational economic benefit. As the minister indicated in his letter of 20 March to the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), his reasons for opening the east&hyphen;west runway were essentially political in character.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are not even talking about `affordable safety'&mdash;some have been condemned for this&mdash;where aircraft safety is being compromised for economic reasons; we are talking about affordable safety for blatantly political purposes. The facts of the matter are that these events are going to continue. The pressures on Kingsford Smith airport are going to increase to an intolerable level, particularly as we are approaching the Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has not acknowledged the fact that at Holsworthy there is a designated sacred Aboriginal site. Even if he does not acknowledge that fact&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is incumbent on all good governments to have long&hyphen;term planning&mdash;a trait that, sadly, was lacking under the Keating&hyphen;Hawke government. The problems at KSA were evident 12 to 15 years ago. What did the Labor Party do about that when they were in government? They ordered an EIS for Badgerys Creek. That is well and good&mdash;a first step.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Was there any intention of proceeding with Badgerys Creek? Let us have a look at the situation. After they ordered the EIS, eight years went by and they thought, `We'd better do something about this.' So if they were fair dinkum about proceeding at Badgerys Creek, why didn't they proceed when the EIS came in? There was no action on Badgerys Creek. What did they do when it became evident that KSA was becoming overcongested? They said, `We'll build a third runway.' Once they built the third runway, they closed the east&hyphen;west runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us see who benefited the most from the closure of the east&hyphen;west runway. There were no more flights over the state electorate of Maroubra, no more flights over the state electorate of Heffron and no more flights over the federal electorate of Kingsford&hyphen;Smith. That begs the question: was the then Minister for Transport, the member for KingsfordSmith (Mr Brereton), acting impartially in the pursuit of his policy initiatives? Is it by coincidence that the flights were all but removed specifically over those two state and one federal electorates? Is it coincidence only that those electorates that have benefited the most are those of the now Premier of New South Wales, the member for Maroubra; the Labor member for Heffron; and the former minister, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to entering the federal parliament, I was a member of the New South Wales state parliament for 12 years. I have never come across an issue that has brought decent, good Australians out into the streets as much as this issue. In the meantime, what is happening at Badgerys Creek? Absolutely nothing. I marched on Kingsford Smith airport during that very first demonstration, when tens of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thousands of inner city Australians turned out to protest at what was going on. The people were all highly critical of the then Minister for Transport. Those who were the most critical were his own state Labor colleagues. They were calling out for two things: the re&hyphen;opening of the east&hyphen;west runway and the building of the second airport. What about the second airport? There has been a lot of talk today about how fair dinkum those opposite were on pushing ahead with the building of the second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a side track, I must say that I looked up the forward estimates for 1993&hyphen;94. If the people opposite were fair dinkum about building the airport then why was there absolutely no money allocated towards the cost of building the second airport? What plans did those on the other side have to encourage Qantas and Ansett to move out to the new airport?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. Panic was starting to set in, within the ranks. What visionary plan was put in place to solve the problem? What saving grace did those on the other side exhibit in resolving the problem at KSA? Did they place a cap at Sydney airport? People were going off their brains <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="943"> with the noise. No, the then Leader of the Opposition raised the matter in parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How did they respond to that? They said, `We'll send it off to a committee.'  Did they enshrine in legislation mandatory penalties for breaking the curfew? Again, it was the then Leader of the Opposition who came forward in regard to this matter, and they opposed that and again it went off to a committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was happening at Badgerys Creek with all this inaction by those opposite? Absolutely nothing. Where was the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) then? I note he is not even in the chamber. It is his MPI and he has left the chamber. What did he say then about the issue? Did he raise the issue in parliament if he was so concerned about this matter? No, absolutely not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where were the other members opposite in regard to the problems at Kingsford Smith? Under the Labor government's proposal, what sort of an airport was being envisaged at KSA? A major international airport? How can you justify that with the short runways you had planned? What about the infrastructure around the proposed new airport&mdash;buildings and houses going up? What if you wanted to expand the airport? You could not do it because the properties were being sold and bought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that the only airport that was being planned by those opposite was a small&hyphen;scale regional airport. Further panic was starting to set in the Labor ranks. Election day was approaching. The former Minister for Transport then decided to act, and act decisively. And what did he do in January this year, after 10 years of inaction? He ordered another EIS. He got caught out. There is no doubt in our minds that he was going to announce the start of work on the new Badgerys Creek airport but he got caught out because his departmental officers told him, `You can't start building an airport with a 10&hyphen;year&hyphen;old EIS.' So what did he do? He ordered another EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An election commitment was made by the coalition government&mdash;sharing the pain by re&hyphen;opening the east&hyphen;west runway, a cap on flights, a curfew, a full EIS on Badgerys Creek, and that is all occurring. But let us <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> look at the hypocrisy of those opposite. It takes approximately 18 months for a full EIS. Let us assume that the EIS is not satisfactory. In other words, what those opposite were saying was that they would wait 18 months for the result of the EIS and, if the EIS stated that Badgerys Creek was not the place to put it, they would then have to look around for another site and they would have to order another EIS, which would take another year and a half.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time remaining to me, as my speech was cut short last night when the debate was adjourned, I wish to say something about the matter of the gun laws in this country, which has created a great deal of controversy. Someone remarked to me that, with 800,000 people unemployed and overseas debt running at over $180 billion net, there are more important things to be speaking about. But it has caused a great deal of emotion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In saying that, I do not want to diminish the great horror and dismay which we all experienced with regard to the Port Arthur massacre which took place not so long ago. In particular, I wish to commend the response of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who has shown great leadership on this issue, as have the police ministers from all the states and territories and from all major political parties. They have behaved extremely well and in response to the desires of the Australian people. Most opinion polls show about 90 per cent of people in support and about six to eight per cent opposing what was done, with two to four per cent undecided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stress that I support the thrust and substance of what has been proposed, though when it comes down to the detail of what is decided in the legislation that will go before the various state parliaments around this country I hope consideration can be given to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a number of matters that I wish to raise now, particularly matters relating to semi&hyphen;automatic rifles, semi&hyphen;automatic shotguns and pump action shotguns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there is going to be provision for farmers and professional shooters&mdash;under certain stringent circumstances&mdash;to be able to use these weapons, but I have a particular concern about sporting shooters. I say this very carefully because what I wish to put before the House in no way compromises safety to the Australian public, which of course is behind the thrust of what has been proposed generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sporting shooters&mdash;apart from a few rednecks at meetings up in Queensland whom we have seen on our television screens recently&mdash;are responsible citizens of the highest order and are very safety conscious indeed; they have always been this way. In fact, a group representing clay target shooters and field and game shooters came to see me the other day, and they described to me various incidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some time ago there was an incident on their range at Dubbo when, after the clay pigeon box was emptied, the wind caught the box and swept it across the range. Someone fired a shot into the box and was immediately ordered off the range. That is how strong a priority they put on safety. No animals or birds can be shot on ranges, and birds get to know this of course and fly around these ranges as they do anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people also instruct children on safety measures. They provide a very valuable community service, I believe, because they get the gung&hyphen;ho macho element out of the children by instructing them on how serious it is to use firearms. If there is any money left over from the extension of the Medicare levy&mdash;a subject which we will debate in coming weeks&mdash;then perhaps some of that money could be used towards increasing firearm safety awareness, particularly for children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to read from a letter which was composed by the four main firearm dealers in Dubbo, the main city in my area. The letter was written by Peter George of Carrington Firearms, Austin Bourke of Austin Bourke's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="946"> Bastille Gun Shop, Bob Dowling of Macquarie Arms Co. and Peter Kay, a gunsmith and qualified tradesman. They wrote to me on the proposed new gun laws, and they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We refer to the meeting between the proprietors of the four firearms shops in Dubbo held in your office on the 17.5.96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of that meeting we respectfully suggest steps that could be taken to ensure that the Federal Governments objective of uniform Gun Laws, "Making Australia a Safer Place" and removing military style weapons from the general public, can be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are also mindful of the monetary cost to the Australian Taxpayer, which if the present suggestions are carried through, and every effected gun owner complied, would run into an excess of Four Billion Dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the best estimate that we can make based on our combined 125 years experience in dealing with those involved in Firearms use, as it applies to the various disciplines of the Firearms Sports, Pest Control and collecting etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To achieve the Governments objectives outlined above, we believe that the implementation of the Classes 1. and 2. of the N.S.W. Firearms Act (prior to 14.5.96) be applied to Australia Wide.</PARA>
<PARA>They go on to describe what class 1 and class 2 shooters' licences and permits over and above those licences mean. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">N.S.W. Premier Carr has stated on numerous occasions that "N.S.W. has the toughest workable firearms laws in Australia."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compensation payable on the proposed legislation would be an unnecessary and enormous burden on the Australian Taxpayer, if the N.S.W. Firearms Laws were adopted Australia Wide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We take this opportunity to thank you for enabling us to express our views and if we can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact us. Would you also kindly keep us informed of the developments as they occur in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>They are simply proposing that semi&hyphen;automatic rifles and, particularly, shotguns be used on the ranges. Even though the magazines of semi&hyphen;automatics hold five rounds, you are only allowed to put two cartridges in them. If you put three cartridges in and miss the clay pigeon with the first two shots, you could fire off a third shot, pretend it was your second shot and still have it counted as a score. They <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are only firing off what can be fired off with a double&hyphen;barrelled side by side or under and over firearm anyhow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members of the group also said that the self&hyphen;loading guns are particularly good for use by women, who are taking up this sport in increasing numbers. They are particularly good, too, for use by over&hyphen;70&hyphen;year&hyphen;old people who find the weight of two barrels a little onerous. Also, because these self&hyphen;loading shotguns are gas operated, there is less recoil on the shoulder. For elderly people who have been shooting all their lives, this is a bonus. The members of the group asked me to put these matters before the parliament to see if they could be considered by the police ministers, the Premiers and the Chief Ministers around Australia when the legislation is drawn up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Duck shooters do not exist any more in New South Wales, since they were banned, but down in Victoria if you have got to break your barrel when you are standing deep in water and cannot use an automatic magazine, then this is also a hindrance. Perhaps we could crimp the magazines of these semi&hyphen;automatics to restrict them to two cartridges. It is something that I hope would be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are allowed to use semi&hyphen;automatic pistols on ranges now, so surely it is not inconsistent to be able to use semi&hyphen;automatic shotguns&mdash;and possibly semi&hyphen;automatic rifles&mdash;in these particular sports. I commend those thoughts to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latest statements on Badgerys Creek made by the Minister for Transport and Regional Affairs (Mr Sharp) are a complete surprise. As a resident and member of parliament for that area for many years, it is a very pleasant surprise, but a surprise nevertheless. Who would have thought that we would now <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="947"> see such a change in a man who just two months ago said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to make Sydney West Airport capable of all international flights we have to extend the length of it . . . we've got to obviously re&hyphen;design the details of Sydney West Airport.</PARA>
<PARA>Or, in another statement he made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Badgerys Creek is part of the airport solution . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Or, in relation to getting it up and running before the Olympics, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, we will certainly try it. Laurie Brereton again said you couldn't do it . . . but we're going to give it the best shot we can to get it done in time for the Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA>If the minister would like to say that he did not make those comments or remarks, I can assure him that I have the tape as I taped the particular program on 2BL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there was no mention then of Holsworthy, or even of `eggs in the baskets', or even about a second EIS; nor was there any mention of this in the coalition's airport policy document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Putting people first</EMPHASIS>. I actually went back and reread it. Now the minister has turned around and announced a new EIS for Holsworthy to be operated in conjunction with the present one being carried out for Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must admit that, when I heard about that yesterday and then again this morning, I wondered whether the member for Hughes (Ms Vale) had been consulted about what a second investigation into a new EIS at Holsworthy would mean to an electorate like hers. She probably only found out today and she probably also found out that the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) has decided that he is not going to take any more of the type of action that I have had to take year in and year out from the groups that I represent. Those groups probably went bashing down his door and he has decided to pass the buck. He won out, and now the member for Hughes is going to have to suffer for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as Badgerys Creek is going, I hate to say to the minister but I will say: I told you so. Since Badgerys Creek was first selected as the site for the second Sydney airport, I have viewed its impending development with a very jaundiced eye. Since coming into this House in 1990, I have used my <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> speaking times repeatedly to question the wisdom of our then government in planning an airport at that particular location, and I have repeatedly lobbied my ministers to this effect. I have no problem in admitting that at times I became, not a thorn in the side, but perhaps a stone in the shoe of both the former Minister for Transport and the former minister for the environment. I certainly did chew their respective ears off as to the dangers of Badgerys Creek and why we should look elsewhere for a suitable site for a second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times my fight has been supported by various people within my own community. I am sure this House is aware that the political fights surrounding airports are not usually pretty ones, nor are they clean. I am sure that the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), one of my colleagues who is here at the moment, would certainly support me when I say that different people certainly become emotionally involved when we talk about airports, particularly when the aeroplanes are flying over their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly one of the more vocal groups in my community is the Fairfield Residents Against Airport Noise, or FRAAN, as it is more popularly known. As someone who personally has always been against the proposed airport at Badgerys Creek, I initially viewed FRAAN, upon its inception in July of last year&mdash;take note, it formed only last July&mdash;as a genuine outpouring of community feeling. I saw it as a group of concerned individuals, independent of political beliefs, asking questions and raising issues about Badgerys Creek for the common good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This view has certainly changed somewhat over the past 10 months, especially as various leaders in the group have attempted to smear my name by saying that I was always for the airport and that I was actively participating in the supposed deception of the community over the former government's plans for Sydney West airport. However, to this day, I recognise that there are still members of FRAAN who maintain the community-minded intentions with which the group first began. I offer them my continued support and I thank them for the encouragement that they, in turn, have given to me.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="948">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the election I had the great pleasure of making representations on behalf of a number of people, both within my electorate and outside, who suggested alternative and far superior sites for airport development. The question of Holsworthy was certainly only one of those from one constituent of mine, a Mr Alex Pope, who approached me at the very beginning of this year to make representation to the Environment Protection Agency on his behalf. I suppose he must have been very pleased this morning when he read about how that is now going to be given consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other site about which I have also written to the respective authorities suggesting further investigation was Goulburn&mdash;and the minister well knows this. I had prepared myself for a long struggle ahead with the new government, particularly after the minister's initial statements, which were made once he had assumed the reins in his portfolio. Now I have been delivered this new news like manna from heaven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`What could have brought about this development?' I stopped to think this morning. I thought, `Is it sheer good sense?' which, I must say, is not entirely out of the question. Or is it perhaps the fact that Badgerys Creek is now circled by a number of new Liberal seats, including, as I stated earlier, the seat of the Minister for Finance? This cannot be discounted either&mdash;and, if you are a politician, you do not discount anything. I dare say that the minister has had time to reflect and, in doing so, perhaps even seen the error of his government's plans&mdash;not only to build at Badgerys Creek but to expand the airport to reach international size rather than let it remain as an overflow operation, as the previous government always intended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than continuing these two EISs, I say to the minister that Goulburn certainly seems to be coming more and more the attractive proposition as each day passes, particularly as references to the very fast train project have begun to increase exponentially in recent times. I would suggest to the minister that now is the perfect time for a reappraisal of the merits of locating Sydney's second airport at Goulburn. An airport at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Goulburn could only increase the value of a very fast train operation. Conversely, it would only be through a very fast train link that such an airport could be made viable. If my memory serves me correctly&mdash;and having read that EIS over and over again I think it does&mdash;Goulburn was originally counted out of the airport site selection process in the mid-1980s due to the fact that it would lie approximately 200 kilometres from the city it would primarily serve&mdash;that is, Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doesn't a very fast train entering into the equation change things? Just as the minister has now told the House that technological advances have rendered the unexploded bombs at Holsworthy not a problem, can't the same be said with regard to the technological advances regarding rail travel? When we look at what speeds these trains can now reach and the short time it would take for them to cover those very long distances, it really does become awe inspiring&mdash;I think more than awe inspiring. The transportation possibilities raised by the very fast train actually negate the factors for which Goulburn was rejected as an airport site in the first place. With the very fast train rendering the argument of distance impotent, the positive aspects of Goulburn as the choice for Sydney's second airport site suddenly come into focus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the `people' factor for a start. There are many proponents of Badgerys Creek in Sydney&mdash;some of whom are in this parliament&mdash;who believe that the airport, once built, would be situated in some sort of isolated and empty country setting. While the rural nature of the site is not questioned, the fact that it is now fringed by some of Sydney's fastest growing housing developments is failing to loom large enough in people's minds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="949"> It is estimated that only 1,500 people would be directly affected by Badgerys Creek. I would personally wager that many thousands more will be affected. The construction of an airport at Goulburn, on the other hand, would affect less than 100 people. It may pose a concern to sheep and cattle! We may have to investigate those concerns. We are not paying close enough attention to the fact that beyond the fringe there are the more heavily populat ed areas of the greater western suburbs of Sydney, which are growing at the moment at an incredibly fast pace. Goulburn has none of these population worries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my mind, population worries also count against Holsworthy as a site for the airport. Much has been said in the papers this morning about those vast tracts of national park that surround the proposed Holsworthy airport site. I am sure the members for Cook (Mr Mutch), Hughes and Fowler (Mr Grace)&mdash;and I know the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has expressed his concerns&mdash;would certainly have things to say about the effect on the homes and lifestyles of their constituents. I know that, as concerned members of parliament, they would be concerned that the lifestyles of their constituents would be affected by airport noise should Holsworthy ever be built.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are no longer a small isolated state. No matter where the second airport goes, it must have 24&hyphen;hour operation. This is not feasible and not possible at Badgerys Creek. It certainly would not be possible at Holsworthy. I do not believe that we should even contemplate having an airport that operates 24 hours a day anywhere near a large congregation of residents. To build another airport in this state without that capacity is foolish indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Situated as it is, far from even the slightest suggestion of urban sprawl, Goulburn would have the least environmental impact of any of the sites so far considered for the airport. As the airport grew there would be no danger of it encroaching on the lives of thousands upon thousands of people, nor would there be any problems with it operating on a 24&hyphen;hour basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also other less obvious problems associated with Badgerys Creek. For example, there is no evidence of the Goulburn site ever having been used as an ancient Aboriginal settlement. Such evidence has recently been uncovered at Badgerys Creek. The Holsworthy site has been recognised and documented as including 23 Aboriginal archaeological sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we also have to remember that Holsworthy, like Badgerys Creek, is also situated well within the Sydney basin. The concerns that we have had in south&hyphen;western <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Sydney regarding the smog and air pollution that would be an unavoidable spin-off from Badgerys Creek are still relevant when looking at Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Goulburn has none of these problems. When looked at in conjunction with the very fast train service, these are the positives which I believe we should now be considering. In relation to the very fast train, Australia is at the moment inadvertently well placed to reap the benefits from the amazing advances that have taken place in the area of rail travel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two types of very fast train available to us now. One has been put forward by the company Speedrail, which advocates the use of a train modelled on the French designed TGV. It reaches speeds of up to 300 kilometres an hour. The TGV, believe it or not, is not actually now at the forefront of fast rail technology. That honour goes to a train called Transrapid, otherwise known as Maglev.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Maglev forgoes the traditional `wheel on steel' approach to rail travel in favour of a carriage which sits above the tracks thanks to magnetic levitation. I know that it sounds like something that H.G. Wells would have come up with some 100 years ago, but a Maglev train will actually go into operation between Berlin and Hamburg in 1998. It will reach speeds of 580 kilometres per hour. Looking at the opportunities a train such as the Maglev carries with it, Australia, having delayed taking up the very fast option until now, has a chance to actually step in at the top end of the queue of rail technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is estimated that the TGV would take approximately one hour to reach Goulburn on its way to Canberra, then we could expect the Maglev to take a much shorter time than that&mdash;in fact, it is estimated that it would take less than 45 minutes with stops. That is less time than it takes to travel by Sydney rail from Central Station to my electorate in Fairfield, which is in the western suburbs, let alone going on another 15 to 30 minutes to Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is how the situation appears to me. I have enough confidence in the case for Goulburn as Sydney's second airport site that I had no hesitation in making representations <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="950"> on this subject to the former minister for the environment, the Executive Director of the EPA and the Secretary to the Department of Transport on behalf of Mr Tony Lamarra, the former mayor of the city of Goulburn, some months ago. I know those people have made countless representations to the present minister for transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not presume to have enough expertise on this subject that I hold Goulburn up to the House and the minister for transport as some sort of faultless answer to that vexing question of where to place Sydney's second airport. Of course we would encounter problems with the site. There would have to be a great deal of consultation with the people of Goulburn&mdash;a point I am sure the minister for transport would strongly agree with, considering the area is included within his own electorate. However, subject to the hurdle of gaining approval for the high&hyphen;speed rail link, any problems associated with Goulburn, I am confident, would be far more easily overcome than those linked with Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy. Building an airport at Badgerys Creek may have made sense 10 or 15 years ago. Now it continues to do so less and less as every young family chooses to make south&hyphen;western Sydney their home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sydney basin has a finite population capacity and it is clearly approaching its limits for absorbing air and water pollution. In going ahead with Badgerys Creek I fear we are going to be subjecting that growing population of south&hyphen;western Sydney to the sorts of social and environmental problems which have developed for the residents of the inner city.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am quite aware that by suggesting Goulburn I am sticking my neck out. I know that to place an airport in Goulburn may not seem to make sense to some. However, I would suggest that it only fails to make sense to those people who persist in viewing the development of airports in the conventional, traditional way that we seem to have become accustomed to. I would have thought that the pain and the suffering surrounding the development of Sydney's third runway and the failure of governments to gain popular approval for Badgerys Creek should have told us that those ways of looking at airport development and operation have passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in Sydney have developed an ingrained cynicism and hostility in regard to the building and the operation of airports&mdash;a bitterness that I think will never be overcome and which I am sure will come to the surface again if and when Holsworthy is ever selected. The onus is on the government to think further ahead than just the 2000 Olympics. We have to look 25 or 30 years down the track. By that time we will look back and question our judgment as to why Badgerys Creek was ever considered. I hope we will not have to kick ourselves and ask how we were stupid enough to actually let it be built there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the minister must weigh up the pros and cons. I think you will see, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;as would the government if they would take their blinkers off&mdash;that Badgerys Creek is not necessarily the answer to the Sydney airport problems. I do not believe Holsworthy is either, for the reasons I have submitted in the very short time that I have had here today&mdash;bearing in mind that we only heard something like 18 hours ago about this wonderful gesture on behalf of the minister to run two concurrent EISs, much to the amazement, I am sure, of all the population in that area who are now going to be subjected to that. Certainly, it was never a commitment given by the now government during their campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Goulburn, I believe, is the place for a third EIS. If you wish to have two EISs, have a third. Have one where it is going to be plausible in the future to build an airport for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="951"> future, not as a stopgap. I also believe that the government must acknowledge that the current EIS which is being investigated was commenced under the previous government. It was commenced in such a way that we will have ongoing consultation on water and land, and on flight paths. This was a guarantee supplied to us by the then bureaucrats from the EPA and the transport departments at public meetings attended by many people, not just myself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe when they have started to go into that investigation they will find that to have a 24&hyphen;hour operating airport in an area like Badgerys Creek in the Sydney basin is going to be a disaster. I believe we can correct those mistakes now. Let's not make them in the first place. If we are now going to contemplate, with the extra expenditure of another EIS, taking into account a site such as Holsworthy, surely to God commonsense can prevail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the new member for Hughes will join me and support me so that, on behalf of her constituents as well, we can say to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, `Give consideration to a third EIS. Keep your two, if you want them. One is already started; one you are about to commence. At least have commonsense and take the blinkers off. Look at the feasibilities of where an airport for the future residents of this country should be built and also look at the probabilities of providing a fast rail transport. Get those trucks off the roads. Get immediate transportation from the airport to the very fast trains and let us, for once, see vision when we start thinking about airports for the future.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say at the outset that it is an honour to be elected as a member of the Howard coalition government. In the first few <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> weeks of my parliamentary life I have seen this government bring to an end that fatalistic acceptance of mediocrity that had come to dominate Australian life. For years we have had to cop the rhetoric that told us that high unemployment was inevitable and that the will of the people was to be determined by vocal and divisive interest groups. These weeks have brought to an end such rhetoric and have returned to us a sense of hope. And I want that hope to last.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If representing an electorate in federal parliament were not in itself a great responsibility, I find myself humbled by the memory of the man whose name appears on the window on my electorate office. As we approach the centenary of Federation I cannot help but think of what it must have been like to be there&mdash;to be at the birth of a nation. I think of how Alfred Deakin anticipated so many of Federation's potential difficulties, yet continued to fight for a constitution that will bring us together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In March 1898, in his now famous speech at the Bendigo ANA conference, Deakin said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Federal constitution is the last and final product of political intellect and constructed ingenuity; it represents the highest development of the possibilities of self&hyphen;government of peoples scattered over a large area. Yet I venture to submit that among all federal constitutions of the world, you will look in vain for one as broad in its popular base, as liberal in its working principles, as generous in its aim, as this measure.</PARA>
<PARA>The constitution taught us about Deakin the idealist. But to get all those involved in the debate to accept the constitution taught us about Deakin the politician.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Politics is the pragmatic side of the process&mdash;it is the art of perpetual compromise. Yet, as skilful politicians, we can, through compromise, bring about significant change. The idea can withstand the impact of politics; the idealist and the politician can be one and the same. Constitutional reform should be far&hyphen;sighted and supported by the Australian people every step of the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Five years out from our centenary celebrations, the challenges that confront our government today are just as significant as those faced by our founding fathers. We are being asked to examine the role of the monarchy. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="952"> We are being asked to mould a new state&hyphen;Commonwealth relationship, and we are being asked to provide stability, order and prosperity in an ever changing and uncertain global village.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot help but think that, were Alfred Deakin able to stroll down the Maroondah Highway and through the streets of the electorate which today bears his name, he would be quite proud of our nation. However, he would also be aware of a community still in need of political action. He would realise that this is not a postcard federal seat. We have no Blue Mountains, Barrier Reef or Opera House. Our monuments are the 111,000 people who live in Deakin's sprawling suburbs, whose existence is not always glamorous and exciting but is often dignified and meaningful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people in my electorate are descendants of the very first Australians, those who lived here 40,000 years ago. Others are related to those who fought for our nation in more recent times, while others have lived in Deakin for less than a generation. Deakin's population is ageing. Those over 55 years of age now represent over 30 per cent of the population. This reality brings with it new demands on our infrastructure. It means that the demand for government assistance will increase rather than diminish. The chronic shortage of nursing home beds, the plight of our home carers and the continuing need for health services for the aged were some of the issues on which my election campaign was fought. These were the issues highlighted by the Gregory report, yet neglected by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families with young children are also making their presence felt in Deakin, particularly in the outer&hyphen;east growth areas. These are families at their most vulnerable stage, for whom the health of Australia's economy is not merely a series of statistics but the difference between employment and falling beneath the poverty line. As the coalition's policy for families states, `A loving, supportive and stable family environment is the best and most enduring system of social support.' Therefore, government policy must be directed at strengthening families.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate lies at the heart of the fastest growing suburban region outside Canberra and the Gold Coast. It is becoming the IT and communications hub of Australia. This is placing incredible strain on the region's infrastructure, particularly on our road links with the wharves, airport, and the major interstate highway. Fifty&hyphen;eight per cent of all finished goods in the area are moving northward along the Hume Highway. This means, according to some estimates, that average vehicle trip times in eastern Melbourne will increase by one-fifth by the year 2011, placing another unnecessary oncost to those who create the jobs and the wealth for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed Scoresby freeway will provide us with a way of relieving this pressure. It could offer an escape from the deadlock which will be crippling to the economy of the east. I will be encouraging the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to list the Scoresby transport corridor as a `road of national significance', making the project eligible for private sector funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deakin today is a community which is rich in cultural, ethnic and religious diversity, something which our founding fathers may not have envisaged but which is certainly part of those traditions of social justice and acceptance they wrote into our constitution. Deakin has sizeable Greek, Italian and Chinese communities. Languages other than English are spoken in 16 per cent of homes and this percentage is growing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a more spiritual level, my electorate has large and active Christian communities. The suburb of Blackburn is considered Australia's Baptist capital, something of which we are particularly proud&mdash;and I know our Treasurer (Mr Costello) is. Deakin is also home to several other large Christian denominations, as well as other religious communities from around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The less savoury aspect of the seat of Deakin is not always immediately apparent. It seems to me that the fight against youth homelessness and unemployment has focused most people's attention on Melbourne's west where the problems are more visible at street level. However, those in Deakin who are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="953"> familiar with the plight of the homeless, the unemployed and those employed but unable to make ends meet will know that 13 years of Labor have not been kind to our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deakin and the outer&hyphen;eastern region is in need of the government's youth homeless pilot project and the regional community employment councils being established with the support of the local councils and the community groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a blight on our society that there is only one youth refuge in the region&mdash;Wesley 121 with eight beds. We need to tackle youth homelessness in the suburbs and at a family level as a way of preventing the exodus into the inner city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having worked with the long&hyphen;term unemployed under one of the myriad of Labor market programs offered through DEET, I am fully aware of what has and has not been done to help the unemployed find work. I was dismayed to discover that many programs do little more than create a false and cruel expectation in the eyes of recipients that they will find work. On Friday I attended the graduation ceremony of four young people from the local landcare and environment action program. After 26 weeks of hard work, they had acquired skills in environmental management and had made a stand against environmental degradation. But after the ceremony one of the parents took to the stage to urge CES and DEET to offer training with a purpose, to find jobs and to train young Australians to get them. I believe that programs that prepare young people for real jobs need to be encouraged, but these programs are pointless unless jobs are created for people to go to. Despite the rhetoric of Working Nation, the Labor government failed to create real, meaningful, long&hyphen;term jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Group training companies in my electorate are delivering successful programs based on industry, company and community needs and not on artificial needs created by bureaucrats. These companies must be encouraged. Industry in my electorate ranges from the small to the medium sized. There are companies which produce chocolate, underwear, tiles, fibres&mdash;more or less everything. Yet my involvement with the local chambers of commerce in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Ringwood and Blackburn has strengthened my resolve to demand urgent industrial relations reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For industry to continue to work for the people of Deakin, it is my belief that the industrial relations package, as announced in the Governor-General's speech, must be passed. I say that not out of blind commitment to political ideology but because I know the world of industrial relations and I understand the risks a society runs when groups set out to protect their own vested interests. I am talking about not only unions but also employer associations, companies and practitioners who have put in place an industrial relations club in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I speak from experience about industrial relations. My professional background is somewhat unusual for a member of parliament. I am a registered psychologist. But, please, before my colleagues start to recline in these comfortable chairs and begin to tell me about their problems, allow me to say that I have spent the past 18 years of my professional life in the organisational&hyphen;industrial setting. I have worked in workplace reform, management&hyphen;organisational development, productivity improvement, industrial relations and human resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to be able to say that my relationship with blue-collar workers has always been positive, even in the most heavily unionised work environments. I have worked with both unions and individual employees. I have been successful in gaining their trust, despite the widely held perception that Liberals and unionists cannot work together. It goes without saying that industry needs to be backed by government policies which encourage growth and investment. I believe our government policies will provide such incentives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in the course of my career I have also come across abysmal management practices, poor leadership, short-sightedness and at times pointless anti-union sentiments. Government policies dealing with small business, vocational training and employment must continue to be looked upon as a guide for many companies, but governments cannot do the work <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="954"> for which the employers are ultimately responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since its creation in 1937 the electorate of Deakin has seen its boundaries undergo several changes. It has become more urban than semi-rural. I am proud to say that, except for an 18-month `sabbatical' with the Labor Party, Deakin has always been a Liberal conservative seat. In its 58 years of life, the  seat has been represented by William Hutchinson, Francis Davis, Alan Jarman, John Saunderson, Julian Beale and Ken Aldred. All of these people have made their contribution to parliament, the electorate and the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two of these former members deserve a special mention. The first person is the Hon. Julian Beale, who held the seat between 1984 and 1990 and then went on to represent the seat of Bruce between 1990 and 1996. Julian's support throughout the recent election campaign was appreciated, particularly as he had a tough fight of his own. Julian is a reminder that periodically we must contend with forces that are beyond our control: the redrawn electoral boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second person I wish to mention is Alan Jarman, who served in this House between 1966 and 1983. Although I never met Mr Jarman, I feel his legacy is part of my political and personal identity, and even today he epitomises the notion of a caring and committed local member. His son, David, is a former vice-president of the Victorian division and has been a personal friend and confidant for many members of the Deakin electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard quite a few of my parliamentary colleagues refer to their family backgrounds. Each has staked their claim that the cultural diversity of the House is beginning to reflect that of the Australian society as a whole. Allow me to add my own background to the list. There have been many Australians of Italian origin in federal parliament, mostly on the Labor side of politics&mdash;people with names such as Lazzarini, Luchetti, Klugman and Sciacca. Western Australian Senator John Panizza was the first and&mdash;until now&mdash;the only Liberal Italian-Australian in federal parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My personal first is that I am the first Italian-born member of parliament for the coalition&mdash;a fact which continues to highlight the changing nature of my party. For its own political gains the Labor Party has portrayed the coalition as less accepting of diversity than Labor. With my colleagues, I obviously reject that portrayal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was born in a small town on the northern coast of Sicily and I spent four years of my life in a town called Falcone. It is only a few kilometres away from the birthplace of the former member for Bowman. He will be missed by Australia's Italian community, although I am sure not by my worthy colleague who defeated him on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is impossible not to be moved by stories of immigration because nine times out of 10 they are happy stories, variations on the rags&hyphen;to&hyphen;riches theme. But many Italian-Australians did not make their fortunes in Australia. Many were happy to work in factories, save just enough for a small house in the suburbs and then retire to be with their families in the autumn of their lives. My family story is not much different. My father came from generations of Sicilian immigrants. My grandfather had travelled to Argentina and New York, before returning home. My father arrived in Fremantle in 1959 and I arrived a year later aged four.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the economic conditions in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s my parents were able to stake their claim on the typical migrant dream. They worked, they gave their children what they were never able to have and they retired to the suburbs. It was not luck; it was hard work, and my parents owe Australia as much as Australia owes them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We grew up in an environment which, it was assumed, would spawn nothing but Labor voters. Mum and dad both worked in a Labor-dominated environment. That is why on the day the 38th Parliament was opened I made a point of introducing my family to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer&mdash;the epitome of the kinds of politicians Labor people told my family not to associate with. Yet these are the leaders whom increasing numbers of average Australians, the battlers, are turning to.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="955">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank my parents for being here on that day. Their pride demonstrated their acceptance of my chosen political path. They are proud of me; but equally proud, as I am, of my sister, Isabel, and my two brothers, Laurie and Jack. They could not be here today, but I am sure they are listening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be remiss of me not to thank those prominent Italian-Australians who congratulated me after my election. My thanks go to the Italian Ambassador to Australia, Dr Marcello Spatafora, and the mayor and councillors of the town of Falcone in Sicily, who were genuinely moved by the news of the success of one of their town's sons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, winning this seat has been nothing short of a battle for me. My victory is due to the single&hyphen;minded focus and hard work of many of my supporters. Please bear with me as I acknowledge some of those who made it all possible. Firstly, I thank my wife, Vivienne, who is in the gallery, who has been a true partner throughout the process and without whose support the transition to my new life would have been impossible. To my two little mates, my children Paul and Carla&mdash;the best two kids I could hope for&mdash;thanks.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks go to my branch presidents and the campaign team&mdash;people such as Ross McClymont, Charles and Bernice Hogarth, Kaele Way, James Kimpton, Sue Lawrie, Pam Read, Bev Bailey, Andrew Munro, Merle Hare, Sue Ryan, Jan and Peter Tredrea, Charles Czerny, Ronah Dennis, Margaret Lee, Terry Macdonald, Jim Madden, Andrew Rawlings, Jock Hancox, Tony Callander, Margaret Kirby and the other 480 supporters who helped during the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks also to my local Liberal state members of parliament in Victoria, whose help was invaluable. Thanks also to my close friend the Hon.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks also to Senator Judith Troeth, who gave me the courage many years ago to consider standing for preselection.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A special thanks to ALI, the Association of Liberal Italians, which for the last 20 years has been a strong supporter and communicator of Liberal values in the Italian community. And, finally, thanks to all my friends in Melbourne and Perth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the context of considering the supply bills which are before the House today, I wish to raise the government's announcement today that it will walk away from building the second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. In my first speech two weeks ago, I spoke about the airport at Sydney and the devastating impact it is having on residents in my electorate. I spoke also about how the federal Labor government had pursued programs to alleviate aircraft noise and the reason why the problems with the airport had developed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggested two weeks ago that this was an issue which was about economics. It was about a failure of governments to provide appropriate infrastructure&mdash;that was what the previous Labor government was setting about rectifying&mdash;and not really about aviation. We all understood that it was inevitable that Sydney needed a second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we saw today in the announcement by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), is a repeat of history. From 1972 to 1975, a previous Labor government also set about solving Sydney's second airport needs. In 1974 it chose a site at Galston. With the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="956"> coup which occurred on 11 November 1975, the Fraser government threw that out the window and we saw eight years of prevarication under the conservatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the federal election campaign, my friend Tom Uren wrote to the constituents of Grayndler warning them that, unless the Keating Labor government was returned, Sydney would not see a second airport at Badgerys Creek. Unfortunately, it appears that his prophecy will be proven to be correct. Today we saw the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and John Sharp defend the situation whereby they will establish an EIS into the site at Holsworthy concurrently with the EIS into Badgerys Creek&mdash;the expanded EIS established under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears that the member for Bennelong and the member for Hume are today's Burke and Wills. They are wandering around New South Wales looking for a second airport site. They are looking for that elusive tree stump with the marking `Dig here for a second Sydney airport site'. If ever they find that stump, the member for Hume will turn to the member for Bennelong and say, `Well, what do you reckon about this for the site?' There is no doubt that the member for Bennelong will say, `Oh, not here. It's a bit close to Hunters Hill.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This delay shows a contempt for those residents currently living around the Sydney airport. We are seeing that political will, political courage, foresight and vision are needed to solve Sydney's airport problem. The new minister for transport showed today that he has none of that. We need to look at where Sydney West airport is at. This is not a new proposal. The EIS occurred a decade ago. Holsworthy was considered then and ran second last. Badgerys Creek was chosen as the most appropriate site for Sydney's second airport because it was by far and away the best site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as though nothing has happened since then. Last year's budget allocations of the federal Labor government show that substantial progress has already been made: $306 million has already been allocated for airport development; $152 million has already been spent&mdash;not allocated but spent. All the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> land for Sydney West airport, including the 2,900&hyphen;metre runway, has already been acquired. Some 1,770 hectares of freehold land have been compulsory acquired by the federal government in order to provide a solution to this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already allocated is $21 million for the control tower and firefighting services, $23 million for environmental safeguards, $480 million for roads and $17 million to ensure that the rail corridor is reserved. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development spoke about the cost of this infrastructure, but in terms of its benefits it will not serve just the airport. What Labor had in mind was a visionary approach for a second Sydney airport, one which would not only solve Sydney's airport needs but also provide benefits. Labor intended to provide a ring&hyphen;road which would finally connect the south&hyphen;west of Sydney to the main western lines and main western freeways. That would have had massive employment benefits for the people of western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor also wanted to make sure that we were not simply transferring the problem from Sydney airport to Sydney West airport. So we undertook to do a review and an update of the EIS, and that update was due to report. But it was not to be an EIS looking at alternative sites, because that process has already been done. With this decision today the coalition are essentially saying, `We'll turn the clock back 20 years and we'll once again start the whole process.' It is as though no money has been spent, no money has been allocated and no sites have been looked at up to this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberals' agenda has been consistent in one thing only&mdash;that is, if Labor is for it, they are against it. As the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) would know, the member for Bennelong and the then New South Wales Premier Nick Greiner were the leading advocates for a third runway at Kingsford Smith airport. As members opposite would also know, prior to the election the then Liberal opposition made a statement that Badgerys Creek would go ahead. In fact, on 16 February this year the headline on page 1 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> read `Liberals look at making Badgerys main airport'. They have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="957"> taken a turn, like so many of their broken promises, because it is against the interests of the airline industry and because of their obsession with short-term budgetary considerations. They are just not prepared to put the money that is necessary into public infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To find out the Liberals' real agenda, I refer to the comments of Chris Brown, who is on the Tourism Task Force. Yesterday he went on the John Stanley program on Radio 2UE in Sydney. When asked about their agenda, his response was pretty interesting. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's (1) getting smaller aircraft off the parallel runway, which means maybe&mdash;maybe eighty movements of proper planes an hour, you know, might be appropriate&mdash;we can possibly still live with that&mdash;but when eighty movements an hour include, you know, the old Pitt Street farmer coming in and landing there in time for his lunch appointment in Sydney, denying the tourism industry the export dollars it brings from access to Sydney Airport, then that's the first place to look.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to members opposite, and particularly those who represent the National Party and rural areas, that with the expansion of Sydney airport&mdash;which is inevitable unless something else is done&mdash;rural New South Wales will miss out. They will be forced out because of the need to accommodate the larger jet movements. Chris Brown further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are smarter operational ways of using that airport&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referring to Sydney&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">particularly with the north&hyphen;west, and in the longer term we're going to have to consider ways to increase the infrastructure at KSA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is billions of dollars invested in those terminals, in those runways, and if we can find measures which will increase runway capacity there . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think the tourism industry's agenda is very clear, and what has further been exposed is the attitude of those opposite towards community consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where has the community consultation been with the electorate of Hughes over the choosing of the Holsworthy site? We saw the abolition of the Sydney Airport Community Consultative Committee, of which I was a member and which was established by the previous government. That committee was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> working very well. We came up with a 20-point plan which would have resulted in an immediate reduction of aircraft noise of 30 per cent in the areas around Sydney airport. That committee did not operate along party lines; it operated in the interests of residents. There was only one vote in its one year of existence. It came up with a number of programs, such as the expansion of the acquisition zone in Sydenham and the increase in insulation, which were considered positively and agreed to by the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot of rhetoric from the conservatives about how much they care about working people and how much they care about small business. The committee was considering giving support and compensation and had carried a resolution of support and compensation for small business residents in Sydenham. Because of the third runway, small businesses in Sydenham have had their living denied to them. Businesses are closing down, no-one is going into their stores, and there has been no word from this government about whether they will receive compensation. They have been told that they just have to wait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government set up a committee to look into the flight paths and to report back by 16 December. Advertisements have been placed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and in local papers in my electorate. It is interesting to see who is on that committee. The group receiving the submissions, the Air Traffic Management Task Force, consists of experts on civil and military airspace, flight operations, air safety, environmental issues and communications. There is not a single mention of residents. It is as though people do not matter; the airport is simply there to service industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member who serves the electorate most affected by aircraft noise, I contacted Airservices Australia and asked for a list of who was on this committee. I was told that it was not available and that an official announcement would be made at a later date. Let me quote from the coalition's airport policy, laughingly called `Putting People First', launched at the last election:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition has activity consulted Sydney residents . . . In government we will continue to listen to your views. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="958"> </PARA>
<PARA>That is another broken promise. Obviously, if you live in Hunters Hill or Lane Cove your views are listened to, but if you live in Marrickville, Sydenham or Rockdale do not bother because this government will ignore you. Added to that are the residents of Hughes. If you live in east Liverpool, Chipping Norton or around Holsworthy, do not bother. I wonder whether this government consulted its marginal member, the honourable member for Hughes (Ms Vale)&mdash;destined to be a oncer as a result of today's announcement&mdash;about the decision before it was made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Preferential treatment has been taken a step further. During the election an announcement was made that no planes would go over the electorate of Lowe; the Bermuda Triangle was going to operate. The planes would take off from Kingsford Smith airport. They would hit the Iron Cove Bridge. They would not go right because they would hit the Sydney Harbour Bridge. They would not go straight ahead because we are against the Bennelong funnel and they would not go left because that was over the electorate of Lowe. They would just disappear into thin air. Perhaps the government's commitment to competition policy suggests that they are competing with the new ride at Seaworld in Queensland. That is what would have to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is pretty interesting because there will be another announcement in the next few days. The government, I am sure, will be setting up some form of farcical community consultation. I would not be at all surprised if the chair of that farce is none other than the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can have it one of two ways: either Lowe is not affected by aircraft noise&mdash;in which case why does the member for Lowe care?&mdash;or it is going to be affected by aircraft noise, in which case it is yet another lie. If the member for Lowe agrees to chair that committee, then he stands condemned, as he does by being prepared to participate in today's debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in question time, recent figures show that Sydney airport has grown by over 9.6 per cent. We have an absurd situation in Holsworthy. The Minister for Transport and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Regional Development, in his statement today, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of the 1985 EIS, Holsworthy was not considered suitable because of engineering and unexploded ordnance problems together with the roughness of the terrain and distance from the city.</PARA>
<PARA>Maybe he is trying to slip something through. I understand that ordnance problems refers to bombs. When he talks about less aircraft noise around Holsworthy, perhaps he is excluding the noise that will be made from bombs exploding as the planes arrive. `Undulating terrain'&mdash;it will be like landing at the top of Kathmandu. As I understand it, there are 60&hyphen;metre ravines on this site and the largest number of significant Aboriginal sites&mdash;23, in fact. It has all been considered and rejected. What we are really seeing is another part of Costello's con, another part of deferring budget expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should not say that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development made the announcement on Alan Jones's program; it was more like Alan Jones made the announcement and had the Minister for Transport and Regional Development along to listen. However, when the announcement was made, selling off the land at Badgerys Creek was left open. The government has already acquired it; it has already spent $152 million. Perhaps there will be an announcement down the track that the government will be selling off that land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sydney cannot afford to wait. This is an outrageous breach of faith by the coalition. The former Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), is in the chamber now. To his credit, he had the courage to come out and say that Sydney West airport would be built and he put mechanisms in place to ensure that that would occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was attacked by the coalition. They said, `Oh, we'll do it better.' But we have seen that they will not do it at all. They will not spend the money, the noise will not go away, and there will be an inevitable push to get rid of the curfew and the cap at Sydney airport. We will see both north-south runways running at maximum capacity&mdash;approximately 450,000 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="959"> movements per year and not the 263,000 movements we saw last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government stands condemned. If I were the member for Hughes, I would be pretty nervous. I say to the member for Lowe that a lot of statements have been made. John Howard chose to launch this as his first policy in the electorate of Lowe, and we will be reminding the electorate of the government's broken promises. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These three bills were introduced on 8 May. Supply Bill (No. 1) authorises the Minister for Finance to issue an additional $14,659 million from the consolidated revenue fund. This measure will provide for sufficient expenditure to maintain government service delivery until the August budget is passed by the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The supply bills must be passed by the parliament before 1 July this year to ensure the government has the funds to maintain its program delivery. Amongst other things, Supply Bill (No. 1) foreshadows the introduction of bills to replace the Audit Act 1901. One of these bills will be the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, which is just one of three bills that will totally rewrite the way the federal government's activities are monitored and audited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reform Audit Act was a hotly contested issue in the last parliament, members may recall, with the then Labor government being totally irresponsible in refusing to support amendments to increase the independence of the Australian National Audit Office, the ANAO, from the executive. It was also proposed that the parliament would play a more pro&hyphen;active role in overseeing the operations of ANAO, predominantly through the establishment of a parliamentary committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These recommendations were based on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor&hyphen;General: ally of the people and parliament</EMPHASIS> and a further report from the ANAO entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliament's right to know: legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901</EMPHASIS>. These recommendations should be acted on. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Supply Bill (No. 2) seeks appropriations from the consolidated revenue fund totalling $1,720 million. These funds will be used for a wide range of measures affecting every department except the Department of Industrial Relations. The expenditure items range from the construction of public works and buildings to grants to the states for capital works. Supply Bill (No. 2) also details additional expenditure of $38 million for new government policy initiatives. The third supply bill relates to the parliamentary departments and involves an additional $68 million to keep Parliament House running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these bills, like Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996, are useful in gaining an insight before the budget into the policy and fiscal direction of the new government. The big test, however, will of course be the August budget. Can the government bite the bullet and cut expenditure where required and balance this with keeping faith with the Australian people? That judgment will have to be reserved for the time being.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we already have some insight into the agenda of the government. It appears that the new government is so far inclining towards window dressing. I refer specifically to the government's proposal to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. Although that undertaking was an election promise, it is tokenism at its very worst. But we will have the chance to debate that when the bill is brought on for discussion in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between now and the next election there will be two new certainties in Australian life to add to the age&hyphen;old chestnuts deaths and taxes. We have all come to accept that deaths and taxes are inevitable and under the previous government the death taxes and tax amendments were equally unavoidable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those, over the life of this parliament, we can safely add two new verities. The first is that this government will have broken or will break more election promises than you care to poke a stick at. The second is that the previous Labor regime is to blame because of the parlous state of the Commonwealth government's finances and budgetary condition. The extent to which both claims and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="960"> counterclaims are true will, hopefully, become apparent within a comparatively few short months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a sensible commitment to resist new and eliminate existing duplication of service delivery functions between the federal government on one hand and the state and territory governments on the other, one can be forgiven for thinking that there is the promise of a new spirit of federalism in the air. But that feeling must be tempered by threats along the lines that, if designated federal taxpayers' funds are not used for purposes stipulated by the Commonwealth, it will nevertheless resort to tied grants or some other form of conditional funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let it be abundantly clear: the system of tied grants to states and territories is the biggest single catalyst for duplications of functions between the states and territories on the one hand and the Commonwealth on the other. Tied grants also limit the benefits which will accrue from the states and territories competing to attract investment in industry by restricting the breadth of incentives each government may, at its discretion, want to offer or match.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the score of Commonwealth funding for the states and territories, the government is justified in expecting the latter to accept a fair share of the pruning to be done to get the national government's budget back into surplus. But Labor has used funding cuts to make bunnies of the states and territories during its terms of office. While Labor's spending grew expeditiously, its states and territory funding was ruthlessly reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now past the time for the Commonwealth to bear a greater share of the burden of fiscal responsibility, particularly in light of concerted action by the states to overcome the legacies of previous state governments. Let us hope also that this federal government does not lose sight of substance for shadow in its efforts to reduce its own spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its action in reducing the salaries of so&hyphen;called junior ministers by $10,000 a year each is a classic example of penny&hyphen;pinching populism at its worst. It relies for its effect on the psyche of a part of the population that believed&mdash;and still believe&mdash;that all ministers <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and members are paid much more than they are worth. It shamelessly seeks to pander to blind prejudice. Never mind that salary levels are decided by an independent tribunal, the government as one of its first acts has set a precedent that will cause all members to defend future salary increases rather than getting on with the job they were elected to do. And all for what? It is a saving of $130,000 a year gross or, after tax and superannuation deductions, a net saving per year of $60,000 or thereabouts. The country deserves better than mere populist symbolism from a cabinet which should be devoting all its time and energy to the big picture items of expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is to be fervently hoped that in its programs to trim what it regards as fat in the Public Service the government does not in the way just described go chasing every silly little rabbit down every inconsequential burrow. To this day, the lessons of the Fraser government loom large in the recollections of some. Across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board axing is no substitute for the elimination or refinement of functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If functions are not targeted and cuts of two per cent, five per cent or whatever are to be the order of the day, we will end up with more chiefs than indians in the service, as well as laying the foundation for lows to be followed by highs in some areas of essential expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If history has taught us one thing in this context, it is that, if an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board direction to the Public Service to reduce numbers of employees is the order of the day, it is the gardeners, tea ladies, maintenance personnel and the like who will get the chop. Time wasting by those left in more senior jobs will necessarily proliferate and the restoration and maintenance consequently deferred will become a drain on future budgets as costs are multiplied by a factor of who knows what, in the absence of timely and methodical attention to essential tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="961"> The government will not be forgiven if it takes the easy way out in this element of its approach to cost cutting. The across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board cuts to either spending or staffing levels, without eliminating or reforming functions, is the stuff of short&hyphen;sighted, inadequate govern ment. It is necessary on one hand to reduce recurrent spending, but on the other hand it is pure folly to eliminate or even reduce necessary day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day running costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business figured large in the most recent general election. In Australia today, some would say&mdash;and I am inclined to subscribe to this view&mdash;that small business is truly at a crossroads. If the business community does not receive the attention it deserves from the Howard government, it will never receive a proper hearing. With so much to offer, the coalition should&mdash;and, I hope, will&mdash;do everything to improve the business environment so that our economy can grow as quickly and efficiently as possible. Even more importantly, we need growth to achieve more rapid employment creation. This is so important for so many Australians, particularly our young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In pursuing a policy of freeing up small business, as has been promised by the government, one of the first targets should be serious attention to and reform of the fringe benefits tax. It is complicated and unnecessarily prescriptive. Fringe benefits tax legislation in New Zealand is only one&hyphen;sixth the size of Australian legislation, yet on a per capita basis it nets the New Zealand government more revenue. Not only that, the cost of complying with the New Zealand fringe benefits tax is just over two per cent of total fringe benefits tax receipts in that country while in Australia conservative estimates place it at over 12 per cent. So the fringe benefits tax in Australia is an example of unnecessarily complex tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new government must honour its commitment to simplify that law and all tax law. By simplification I do not mean a carbon copy of Labor's totally discredited tax simplification project. Real tax simplification means not only rewriting the tax laws but also questioning all policy on which those laws are based. Capital gains tax has become a monstrosity that is worse than the FBT. Tax professionals have even greater trouble figuring out the requirements of that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia needs to get the capital gains tax off the backs of all Australians to the maximum possible extent. We should be aiming to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> phase out capital gains tax over the five years following the purchase of each capital item, by reducing each taxable gain by 20 per cent per year. At the very least, the Howard government needs to honour its promise of providing capital tax rollover relief to small business proprietors who reinvest the proceeds from the sale of a small business into another or into an approved superannuation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reform of the industrial relations system is a definite requirement. It is needed to provide small businesses with a labour market system which encourages flexibility and increased productivity. Small businesses want to employ more people in the main, but when the system actively discourages this, such as with the unfair dismissal laws, they naturally avoid employing more staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, legislation reforming the industrial relations system should also benefit employees. The benefits of greater productivity and profitability will flow on to workers in the form of higher real wages. This is only fair. In providing small business with a conducive environment in which to operate, it is not enough for government to just provide a better tax system and a more flexible industrial relations system. The government also needs to create a macro&hyphen;economic environment which is favourable. To that end, lower interest rates are an important factor. At the same time Australia needs to increase national savings and move to a net government sector surplus if interest rates are to be brought down to sustainably lower levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard much about slashing $8 billion from federal government outlays over the next two years. Obviously, this is necessary because of successive Labor governments' profligate fiscal policies, aimed mostly at trying to buy off the electorate. In slashing expenditure, the government must maintain an appropriate balance between economic and social objectives, however.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's approach to cutting expenditure must also be strategic in that it must look to the longer term picture. All programs should be judged against the criteria: what is the objective of the program? Is the objective still relevant? Is the program achieving the objective? Are the alternative <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="962"> means of achieving the objective involving less reliance on government support? To the extent that government support is required, can it be delivered in a more efficient manner?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These criteria have been applied to the best practice and workplace bargaining programs within the Department of Industrial Relations, I understand. Both programs, on examination, lacked objectives which met the public interest, and were axed. Both programs were integral components of Labor's strategy of transferring taxpayer funds to the trade union movement. Other government programs across all departments should face similar rigorous scrutiny and, when found wanting, they should get the chop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposals currently being mooted involving the transfer of some responsibilities to the states, especially in the areas of health and education, also offer great potential for eliminating wasteful federal&hyphen;state duplication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is Australia's low rate of national savings that has been an issue and so much the subject of public discussion over the past few years&mdash;and especially so since the FitzGerald report. Australia's household saving rate is projected to account for only 2.8 per cent of disposable household income in 1996. The Netherlands, with 1.3 per cent, is the only OECD nation with a lower household saving rate. In fact, the majority of OECD countries have saving rates of over 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's household saving rate has not always been so low. In 1978 it was 11.2 per cent and it was about 14 per cent in the early 1970s. Although the level of household saving is expected to increase in the coming years because of compulsory superannuation and greater incentives to save, the real villain in Australia's shocking gross national savings record is the federal government's&mdash;and, to a lesser degree, the state governments'&mdash;poor fiscal policies. This was highlighted when the then Labor federal government in 1988 delivered a budget surplus and overall national savings increased to 22.4 per cent of GDP. In 1993, they slumped to 16.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, Australia's performance has been diminished by a poor&mdash;abysmal, one might say&mdash;balance of payments record. Although <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Netherlands consistently has the lowest household saving rate in the OECD, because that country has an ongoing healthy balance of payments surplus it has maintained gross national savings figures which are consistently higher than the OECD average. In 1993, for example, the Netherlands achieved national savings of 23.3 per cent of GDP. If Australia is going to reverse its poor national savings record, it is obvious that the total government sector, both state and federal governments, needs to operate in surplus and households need further encouragement to save.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills are interim measures and we are in a holding pattern until the August budget. My misgivings and reservations aside, I wish the government well in the important work it has to do. It can hardly do worse than its predecessor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Ships (Capital Grants) Act was passed by the former Labor government in 1987, arising from the maritime reform process which was initiated originally by a former National Party Minister for Transport, Mr Ralph Hunt, and which emerged from the deliberations of the Crawford committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act provided for the payment of a seven per cent bounty or grant to Australian owners of Australian registered ships that were at least 60 metres long and which had crew limits below 21 and, since 1989, below 18. The ships had to be either new or second&hyphen;hand vessels that were under five years old and had previously not been Australian registered ships. There was a five&hyphen;year sunset clause on the legislation and it was subsequently renewed by the parliament in 1992. It is again due to expire in 1997 as a result of the same sunset clause.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="963">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996, put forward to the House by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), in effect amends the act by removing the word `1997' and replacing it with `1996' in order to terminate the grant immediately and, obviously, to not roll over the provisions in the legislation as had previously been the case. The former Labor government had announced that it was going to extend the act again for a further five years to ensure that the grant remained available to Australian shipowners, but clearly under the legislation as it is now proposed that grant will disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation which we have before the House this evening also relates to the repeal of the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;Resident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995, which was adopted by the parliament in response to the Ray Taylor report from SIRA, the Shipping Industry Reform Authority, and which also emerged out of discussions between the government, the Maritime Union of Australia and the Australian Shipowners Association in the latter part of 1994 with respect to the prospective sale of ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This piece of legislation provided that PAYE tax for crew members on vessels trading a majority of the time on international routes would be rebated to the owners of those vessels as a means of ensuring that the competitive gap between Australian shipping and foreign shipping, particularly flag of convenience shipping, was effectively reduced and, therefore, that Australian shipping had some basis on which it could compete with international competitors paying little, if any, tax. It is important to remember that this initiative was not the brainchild of the Maritime Union. It was supported by the Maritime Union of Australia, but it was largely the brainchild of the Australian Shipowners Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As much as it may be derided by the minister and people on the other side, the initiative to rebate PAYE tax for Australian seafarers serving on vessels trading a majority of the time on international routes was in fact largely pushed by the shipowners, adopted by the government of the day and supported by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Maritime Union. It is also important to remember that the initiative involved the owners of the vessels, not the seafarers, getting the fiscal benefit. The seafarers retained the original take&hyphen;home pay, but the tax that would otherwise have been paid to the government was retained by the owners. The bill simply repeals this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also announced that it is going to: repeal section 57AM of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which provides for an accelerated depreciation regime of 20 per cent per annum for Australian ships; either abolish or alter&mdash;depending on when you listen to the minister or when you read the government's policy statements&mdash;the provisions for cabotage and introduce a second register, although there is some form of inquiry planned with respect to both of those propositions; and sell ANL to the highest bidder at the earliest opportunity, though the government will await some sort of report, which I understand is due at the end of the month, from the ANL board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a question mark to complete the picture of the government's assault on the Australian maritime industry. There is a big question mark over $14.5 million of funding which had been budgeted for a world's best practice hydrodynamic testing facility that was planned for the Australian Maritime College at Launceston. The capital grants repeal legislation, supposedly, will save $12 million per annum for the government and the PAYE repeal bill will save $40 million over four years. However, it is important to remember that this is before tax. As both of those benefits were taxable, in the hands of the shipowners the amount that will be saved will be significantly less, particularly when you consider that most of the major shipowners would be paying company tax at a reasonably healthy rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="964"> The government's intentions are clear. Firstly, a few more million dollars must be found for their Fightback agenda to cut the supposed budget deficit&mdash;the budget deficit crisis that they are creating as a guise for introducing a whole range of regressive social cuts. Secondly, there is a blind hatred for the Maritime Union of Australia and the Austral ian shipping industry based on the prejudice that comes from people such as the member for Corangamite who have been the users of these services. It is reflected in the fact that the minister has chosen to appoint Mr Greg Bondar, formerly Executive Director of the Australian Chamber of Shipping, as his maritime adviser. The Australian Chamber of Shipping, in spite of its name, is basically the lobby group for foreign shipping in Australia. It is pretty extraordinary that the minister has chosen to appoint somebody from that background as his adviser, particularly when you consider that it has been stated that Mr Bondar will continue to provide, for some time, assistance and support to the chamber. It is roughly equivalent to the minister for primary industries appointing the European Community's commissioner for agriculture as adviser on primary industry. If it is shipping, nobody seems to care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, with the perverted logic that seems to apply with the coalition, there is an attack on subsidies and regulations that apply to people other than their supporters. If you are a National Party supporter then your subsidies are okay, your rorts are okay. Anybody else who wants some form of assistance will not get it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition opposes this bill and will vote against it both here and in the Senate. The minister is still acting as if he were in opposition. There is no overall strategy for the Australian shipping industry. Companies and investors have been left in limbo. For example, the recently appointed new Chief Executive Officer of ANL, Roger Perkins, stated in response to this legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unfortunate that the government chose to abolish an important tax incentive at a time when other issues within the industry have not yet been resolved.</PARA>
<PARA>There has been considerable confusion about vital structures in the industry. On the one hand, the Liberal policy on cabotage was to abolish it and, on the other, the minister has said, no, there will be an inquiry. Then he said that the current single voyage permit arrangements would be extended and that the government would move over to something a bit like the New Zealand model.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the second register, there was the same sort of response. The minister has announced an inquiry; the government has committed itself to introducing one. As for ANL, there have been all sorts of peculiar speculation about possibly selling it to Coles Myer or other potential buyers&mdash;a very strange suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no examination of the effectiveness of the legislation that we are dealing with today, no attempt to look at the capital grants and the PAYE rebate to see whether they have, in fact, been beneficial to the industry and to the Australian community. There has been no consultation of any substance with affected parties, particularly the Maritime Union, until the last minute when the legislation was being introduced. There were no alternative industry assistance proposals being put forward. There was no real consideration of the merits of these initiatives at all. To the minister, they are just MUA rorts or Australian shippers with snouts in the trough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We might well ask ourselves: who was it who actually initiated these sorts of assistance mechanisms? Who supported the capital grants legislation in 1987? The coalition. Who pushed the PAYE rebate? The shipowners&mdash;people such as BHP, Shell, Mobil, and others. There can be no doubt that this legislation will severely, and probably terminally, damage the Australian shipping industry. The Australian Shipowners Association estimates that it will increase the costs of Australian shipping by about 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International shipping is absolutely riddled with subsidies, tax avoidance and all sorts of arrangements designed to assist shipping industries of the particular countries. Twelve OECD countries have similar arrangements to our PAYE rebate. A number of OECD countries have accelerated depreciation allowances such as the one the minister proposes to abolish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things have been acknowledged recently in a speech by Mr Bob Hutchinson, who is the chair of the National Bulk Commodities Group and, therefore, obviously no great strong supporter of the Australian shipping industry&mdash;in fact, somebody who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="965"> would be likely to be critical of it. Mr Hutchinson has acknowledged the importance of these fiscal assistance measures because our competitors right throughout the world have the same sorts of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apelbaum Consulting figures that were provided to the Australian Shipowners Association comparing the cost structures of Australian shipping with other OECD countries and with the FOC countries indicate that, with these assistance mechanisms which are similar to the mechanisms that apply for other OECD countries, we are pretty competitive with other OECD nations. Also, we are only one or two million dollars per annum per vessel higher in average costs than flag of convenience vessels&mdash;and there are some other offsetting factors which tend to reduce that cost gap, like higher insurance costs for FOC vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will happen if these mechanisms of assistance are removed and nothing is put in their place? Rather than being relatively competitive, particularly with OECD countries, we will be put in an almost totally uncompetitive position. BHP Transport, in the latest edition of its magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ironships</EMPHASIS>, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . removing the capital grants and the PAYE grants would have a dramatic effect on the ability of the Australian flagged fleet to compete internationally. The inclusion of fiscal measures such as these in the Australian flag are important in ensuring Australian vessels share a competitive base similar to those of international vessels against which they compete.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not the Maritime Union of Australia speaking; it is BHP, one of the major Australian shippers that operates both on coastal runs and internationally. It is very clear that, without this assistance, the Australian shipping industry will suffer enormously and the pressure to shift business offshore to flag of convenience vessels and operators will be enormous. The Australian Shipowners Association has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . with such large increases in costs persisting, there is little future for Australian flagged and crewed ships.</PARA>
<PARA>End result: what is left of the Australian industry will be pretty slight indeed. In the time that is left to me, there are a number of detailed issues with the legislation that I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> might advert to. Australia currently has approximately 13 ships engaged in international trade and about 17 which trade both internationally and on coastal routes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the significant things about the PAYE rebate, which is only just starting to evolve&mdash;because it is only a relatively recent initiative&mdash;is that it has created an incentive for companies with vessels that previously have plied only domestic routes to, in effect, double and split them up and use them half of the time on international routes. So there is already at least one example of a company buying another vessel and, rather than simply using one vessel on one domestic route, using each of two vessels for half of the year on the domestic routes and for the other half of the year exporting, in effect, shipping services by plying international routes into the South Pacific. That is only just starting with the PAYE tax rebate. It is an example of the things that will flow from this assistance structure if it is given time to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a huge shipping deficit in our current account, and that is something which will be substantially exacerbated by these measures. A substantial proportion, if not virtually all, of the shipping that is currently done by Australians will shift offshore. About 15 per cent of our invisible imports, which historically have been the major problem in Australia's current account deficit, are accounted for by shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate about woodchipping which occurred about 18 months ago, I recall&mdash;as I am sure honourable members present this evening will recall&mdash;that one of the big issues constantly being pushed by many people was, `We've got a big deficit in timber and paper products in this country, why do we import so much?' If it is good enough to have that logic for timber, paper products and woodchipping, why don't we apply it to shipping?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an enormous current account deficit with shipping services. The government's initiatives this evening are destined to blow that out even further. The decimation of the Australian fleet will have a serious adverse defence impact. There are numerous vessels, some 40 or so, where the owners have memoranda of understanding with the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="966"> navy which relate to how these vessels could be used in Australia's national interest in times of emergency or war. Some of them even have on&hyphen;board equipment which has been paid for by the owners for use in those circumstances. It will enable the ships to be used to assist the navy and military forces in times of emergency or war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all remember well&mdash;and I am sure the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who is at the table, will recall well&mdash;the important contribution made by merchant seamen in Australia's war effort in the Second World War which has only recently been recognised properly. I think it is worth asking ourselves the question: if such circumstances occur again, can we expect the same sort of contribution from vessels crewed by foreigners flagged in Liberia, Panama and the like? I think not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposals will mean that we have fewer trained seafarers. That obviously has implications for our defence preparedness, for our ability to administer safety and environmental maritime regulations. It means that our overall maritime skill pool, from which emerge numbers of people specialised in skilled occupations&mdash;such as harbour masters, investigative and safety personnel for organisations such as AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, and various other state agencies&mdash;will be reduced. There will be less demand for certain types of specialised services which will exacerbate that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be adverse environmental consequences. One of the things that is probably not widely understood in the community is that bulk shipping is pretty much the most environmentally friendly form of transport. The cost base of shipping will shift upwards in Australia. That will mean that a substantial proportion, if not the overwhelming proportion, of cargo currently being carried on Australian ships will shift either to other modes of transport or to flag of convenience vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only need to look at a couple of figures on energy consumption to illustrate this point. Bulk shipping uses 0.2 megajoules of energy per tonne per kilometre compared with 0.4 for rail and 1.4 for trucks. In terms of greenhouse <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> emissions, bulk shipping generates 13 grams of carbon dioxide per tonne per kilometre compared with 29 grams for rail. The figure for motor vehicles is much higher again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this legislation we will also see fewer replacements of older, less fuel efficient ships. The vessels that are carrying Australian cargoes will tend to be less fuel efficient, more energy consuming, more dangerous and more likely to be engaged in things like oil spills and maritime accidents, which are serious problems for our fragile coastline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be less industry development. There are important spin&hyphen;offs that emerge from the maritime industry in Australia&mdash;insurance, provedoring and supply of high&hyphen;tech equipment. We do not build many large vessels in Australia anymore, but we do construct things like high&hyphen;tech guidance systems and various other components that go into the vessels that are constructed. Obviously, if the demand for those vessels is shifted offshore then the potential for Australian companies, particularly in regional Australia, to develop economically is going to diminish significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is instructive to look at Norway by comparison. Norway has less than one per cent of world trade&mdash;that is less than Australia. It has about 4&half; million people, about 10 per cent of the world fleet and about 60,000 to 70,000 people employed in related industries such as ship broking, equipment, insurance, manufacturing and design. This is a classic example of clustering and economic development based on specialisation in certain industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unlikely that Australia is ever going to get to Norway's level in the maritime industry. That illustrates how we are going in the reverse direction and how we are losing all the potential that is starting to unfold for related high&hyphen;tech, high skill industries that are dependent upon having a substantial Australian maritime industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to recognise, and it needs to be emphasised, that Australian shipping has reformed substantially in the past decade. This is something that those on the other side routinely deny. We have seen average crew sizes shift from 31 to 18. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="967"> world average is 24 and the OECD average is 22. Australian shippers have invested $2 billion in the industry since 1989. These are the people that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development says have their snouts in the trough. There have been a thousand voluntary retirements and 1,500 seafarers retrained over the past 10 years. Since 1988, there have been 36 new or replacement vessels commissioned and the average age of vessels in the Australian fleet has gone down to 9.6 years which compares with the world average of 16.6 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House concede that more reform is needed, but it is churlish to deny that major reform and major improvement have not occurred in Australia's maritime industry. The enterprise bargaining process is just starting to unfold with BHP, ANL and the other major companies. That process should be given the opportunity to work. There are issues still to be pursued, particularly with respect to matters such as maintenance at sea and a variety of other things. I have every confidence, provided the industry is allowed to operate and provided its existing support mechanisms are not taken away as this legislation proposes, that further major steps will be taken cooperatively between the Maritime Union of Australia and the major shipowners to improve further the productivity of our maritime fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to see&mdash;and I will be interested to hear the view of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) on this&mdash;that the shipping grant that is being removed by this legislation is being removed retrospectively. Shell is currently having a tanker constructed in Poland at the cost of approximately $53 million. The rebate was figured into the bottom line for that project&mdash;it was obviously worth several million dollars. The end result is that that has been taken away. BHP and Mackay Refined Sugars are in the same position. These three companies have made decisions based on this grant being in place for the forthcoming financial year. That is being removed retrospectively. Those on the other side of the House tend to get very hot under the collar about retrospectivity. Maybe it is a little bit selective.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian shipowners are angered by the government's accusation that they have their snouts in the trough. There was reference to this in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS>. The minister referred to the `windfall gain to existing operators' that the PAYE rebate legislation provided. As the example I cited before of a company moving to export shipping services as a result of the PAYE initiatives indicates, the suggestion that it is simply a windfall gain clearly has no basis in fact. I would like to quote a few statements that have been made recently by leading Australian shipping companies. These comments have been made in response to the minister's legislation. Shell Australia's marine manager, Mike Hines, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The company was upset by the decision to withdraw capital grants for shipping on the basis that it has committed funds to a new vessel which is due to be delivered in March or April next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We view this as a grossly unfair and feel the government should have introduced a transitional provision to accommodate people like ourselves who have contracted a ship and based the economics of the vessel on certain criteria.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Tankships shipping manager, Paul Bendy, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is disappointing to see all the efforts that had gone on within the industry and the last government to resolve the problem end this way. It puts the Australian industry in a more difficult position and we have somehow got to work around it.</PARA>
<PARA>Mobil's marine manager, Andrew Brooking, stated that the company:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is disappointed with the removal of the incentives with nothing put in its place to compensate.</PARA>
<PARA>Robert Hartley, the manager of the Australian Shipowners Association, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the current hiatus, new investment in Australian tonnage is already being put on the hold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without these measures the Australian flag will decline and there would be little point to an Australian second register . . .</PARA>
<PARA>ANL has three trades where the immediate effect of the removal of the PAYE rebate will be $600,000 per vessel. Immediately the viability of each of those trades is seriously threatened&mdash;they are fairly marginal at the moment. BHP is concerned that this initiative will add significantly to the price of export <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="968"> steel which is the last thing that Australia needs, given the related shipping costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ironic thing about all this is that to a substantial degree we are talking about phantom savings here. Not only are we talking about grants that are taxable in the hands of the recipient; we are talking about a situation where the removal of those grants is going to largely destroy the income&hyphen;earning base that produced the tax in the first place. What is going to happen with the PAYE rebate? Are we still going to have a lot of Australian seafarers earning income from Australian shipowners and then paying the tax, so that the government actually gains that $12 million a year? Of course not. It is going to go to foreign crews working on foreign flag vessels, who will not pay any tax, not in Australia or anywhere else. End result: no gain; a phantom gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Exactly the same type of thing is going to happen with the grant. The economic activity that is associated with operating the vessels that are constructed for Australian owners, with the help of the grant, will disappear. The end result is that income that otherwise would have been earned by Australian owners on which they would have paid tax to the government will be earned by foreigners. End result: zero sum game again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth while noting that the proposal to abolish the accelerated depreciation provisions is in effect a very clear breach of the government's commitment not to increase any taxes or to create any new taxes. It is very clear that what this will do is increase the tax being paid by Australian companies engaged in owning and operating ships. It is interesting to compare the accelerated depreciation provision with some of the things that apply in sectors that are the natural constituency&mdash;so&hyphen;claimed&mdash;of the government: agricultural implements, 17 per cent; bulldozers, 20 per cent; harvesters, 20 per cent; general aircraft, 20 per cent; tractors and trucks, 20 per cent; and crop&hyphen;dusting aircraft, 40 per cent. They all get accelerated depreciation. There are no question marks about any of that. That is not a problem. But, when it comes to Australian ships not run by constituents of the National Party, they cannot have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 20 per cent accelerated depreciation. It is okay for their mates, it is okay for their constituencies, but not for people that they do not like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This shows the real agenda. The National Party and the government do not mind subsidies, they do not mind rorts, they do not mind snouts in the trough&mdash;provided it is their subsidies, their rorts, their snouts in the trough. It is reminiscent of Bernard Woolley in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> with the irregular verb. It goes something like this: I subsidise; you pork&hyphen;barrel; he or she rorts. That is basically the National Party approach to these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia as a society has been constructed on a vast network of cross&hyphen;subsidies with people, industries and groups helping each other. You do not need to look much further than the natural constituency of the National Party to see where this has happened&mdash;with diesel fuel rebates, monopoly marketing schemes for various agricultural products, public sector research and development through the CSIRO and departments of agriculture, community service obligations&mdash;</PARA>

I do not oppose these things because this whole country has been developed with these sorts of structures as a base, with everybody helping each other and people cross&hyphen;subsidising each other. As an urban dweller, the costs I pay on things like gas and electricity assist people in rural areas but, equally, what they earn in export income assists me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the National Party is doing and what the government is doing is tackling the subsidies they do not like; tackling things that they see as rorts for people that they do not see as part of their constituency. They are quite happy to leave in place the 40 per cent accelerated depreciation provisions for the crop&hyphen;dusters and for all those things for their own constituency, for their own mates. It is doubly absurd because all of the competitors that Australian shippers face internationally <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="969"> have exactly the same sorts of provisions. Not only is the government removing things from the Australian shipping industry; it is not proposing to remove the equivalents from other industries and other sectors that it regards as its own base. We are removing the shipping subsidies in a way which is going to leave the local industry exposed to unfair competition from people who benefit from exactly the same sorts of subsidies and assistance from their own governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition strenuously opposes this bill. It is driven by blind ideology and by hatred of the Maritime Union of Australia. It comes from a government which has so far shown itself to be completely devoid of any strategy at all for Australian shipping and for the maritime industry. Even the employers are saying that. The bill has minimal fiscal benefits for the budget because, when the grant goes, when the PAYE rebate goes, so does the tax revenue earned by the seafarers and so does the tax revenue that comes from the shipping companies to the government. The end result is a zero sum game. These measures are based on a perverted view that somehow certain sections of the Australian economy, certain parts of Australian society and of the community are entitled to be subsidised by other parts, are entitled to be assisted or entitled to be protected, but only if they support the National Party and the Liberal Party&mdash;only if they are their mates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For everybody else, particularly for those involved in some sort of cost input to the economic activity that is associated with people like the member for Corangamite, there are to be no subsidies. The government is saying, `We do not care if we have got foreigners plying Australian routes, we do not care if Australian seafarers are put out of jobs, we do not mind if the Australian shipping industry goes under, because you do not support the National Party and the Liberal Party. All we are interested in is the costs that apply to our mates. They can keep their subsidies, they can keep their assistance, but we are happy to deregulate everybody else.' The opposition is strongly opposed to this bill and will be voting against it both in the House and in the Senate.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VH4">Mr McARTHUR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Could I address my remarks to some of the comments the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), made on the bill before the House, the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996. I appreciate some of the more sensible comments on the relative costings of sea, rail and road. I understand that and accept those to be the true relativities, and I accept the importance of cheap sea transport. I note also his comment that the average age of Australian shipping is 9.6 years compared with the world average of 17 years. However, on most of his other propositions he shows a considerable lack of knowledge of the issues before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be interested to hear what the member for Shortland has to say about this bill, because he has a great understanding of the issues. Whilst I might disagree with him on some matters, the member for Shortland <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="970"> has had long experience in the industry. The same applies to the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), and I also look forward to hearing his remarks on this important bill before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Melbourne, the shadow minister, who is at the table, talks about exports. Unfortunately, the shadow minister will not allow woodchips to be developed as an export industry. He should go back to his coffee shops in Melbourne and develop some of those arguments with his greenie mates, because he will not allow the woodchip industry to be developed so that it can become an exporter and can utilise the shipping that he is talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the big issues that we are addressing here in the parliament. Should the taxpayers be funding handouts to particular industries? This industry is a case in point. Do we say that special grants would aid competitiveness? The shipping industry is a classic case where grants continue to be given to the shipping industry and the waterside workers, yet competitiveness has steadily declined. Taking the position of the US wheat industry, have handouts and subsidies improved the competitiveness of that industry? Likewise, in European agriculture, have the handouts by the taxpayers&mdash;some $US50 to $US60 billion&mdash;improved the competitiveness of those industries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that four per cent of our international trade is conducted in Australian flag ships, the arguments of the shadow minister at the table are somewhat lacking. Australian ships carry very little of Australia's export and import goods, so this whole argument that we need to support the Australian shipping industry is not paramount to the way our exports and imports are carried across the sea by foreign owned vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As most of us would know, most Australian shipowners are vertically integrated industrial companies, such as BHP, Shell and Caltex. The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996 undoes the grants implemented last year to Australian shipowners engaged in international trade. Members of this House would well recall the arguments when these grants were paid as part of a peace deal brokered to end <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Maritime Union strike in 1994 over the sale of ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a lot of debate throughout the nation, and the strong and leveraged position of the Maritime Union was used on that occasion. The strike resulted in an estimated 200 ships being stuck in Australian ports for five days just over this comparatively minor matter. According to the Australian Chamber of Shipping, the cost of that strike to the shipping industry was approximately $55 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The peace deal initially involved a PAYE tax exemption for seafarers, but Treasury had second thoughts and convinced the government to actually pay the grants to the shipowners, for simplicity and transparency. Again, the shadow minister at the table would well recall those arguments when the former Minister for Transport got up day after day in this parliament and expounded the virtues of this deal. Of course, in the final analysis the Treasury would not come clean on it and there was another backdoor way of implementing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These grants were the equivalent of nominal income tax payable on the earnings of seafarers serving on the ship. Another part of the deal was to strive for further efficiencies in international shipping. Again, they were pies in the skies, given the circumstances. Another element was the peace accord to minimise industrial disputation. Just after we had had a major strike on the waterfront, there is this deal between the former minister, Laurie Brereton, and the MUA and the other maritime unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the MUA took the action of a national strike to support 75 striking workers at CRA. That was their next move&mdash;so much so that they brought the nation to a standstill because of the activities at Weipa. The shadow minister should be well acquainted with the fact that, during the recent federal election, voters at Weipa voted very strongly to support the coalition. What a remarkable turn of events. Having held the nation to ransom, they in fact voted for this side of the parliament and not the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budgetary cost of these grants is estimated at $52 million. This was the sort of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="971"> deal that the former minister was prepared to do to get out of a bit of a hole. The grants cost about $90 million last year, and this amount basically went to the shipowners. In order to be eligible for the grant, the ship must spend the majority of its time in international trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 21 shipowners and 78 Australian owned and registered ships. That is a comparatively small number in view of the amount of international trade that Australia conducts. Of these ships, 31 are sufficiently involved in international shipping to receive the payment. I would be interested to know how they make the judgment: how do you define those ships that are in international waters and those that travel on domestic routes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP is the largest shipowner in Australia, and others are oil companies such as Mobil, Shell, BP and Caltex, and ANL as well. There are two important things to remember: first, only four per cent of international trade goes into and out of Australia on Australian ships; and, secondly, most Australian shipping companies are vertically integrated industrial companies: BHP, Shell&mdash;one ship based at Geelong&mdash;BP and Caltex, and CSR in the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The grants were paid to the shipowners in respect of between 1,000 to 1,200 Australian seafarers. There are not really many personnel involved, but there is a lot of money involved. The money does not flow to the seafarers themselves, but they benefit from the grants because it makes them easy to employ. On the one hand, you have a bribe to get the people back to work and, on the other hand, you give the money to shipowners. That is a strange way to do business, and I would be interested to know how the shadow minister at the table can defend that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Effectively, their employment is subsidised by about $20,000 per year. The base salary of an Australian crew member is around $40,000. They work eight hours a day plus overtime. They work six months on and six months off. Members of the House ought to be aware of that. I recognise the member for Throsby. I am delighted to see him in the chamber. They work six months on and six <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> months off. All members of the Australian work force ought to be aware of this. Those terms and conditions are quite good because, in the six months off, crew members, wherever they might be, can find another job. They are often employed under the pooled labour system where they are allocated to ships as required. They do not develop loyalty to a particular company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I looked at some of the details of these pooling labour systems, as they have worked on the waterfront, in the shipping industry. The situation seems to be that the deck officers and engineers are employees of shipping companies. That is fair enough. They have a loyalty to the shipping company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ratings&mdash;crew members&mdash;are part of the industry pool, which we have been trying to get away from. Even the member for Shortland would appreciate that. These ratings are called marine cooks, marine stewards&mdash;a seaman's engagement type system. It is written in the award that they have these pooling type systems. The shipping companies are responsible for paying the ratings while they are on the ship and while they are on leave, which they take after their six months. The ratings, after their period of leave, go back into the industry pool for relocation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought all of us on both sides of the House were looking to change that pooling arrangement, because we know the devastating effect it has on the waterfront. We have this situation where the pooling system does nothing for the waterfront, it does nothing for the shipping companies and in general it does nothing to enhance efficiency or loyalty to any particular employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I concede the point that crew numbers on Australian ships have come down from 30 per vessel to an average of 18 per vessel. I have had a number of discussions with Bill Bolitho about this matter and I concede that on some of the ANL ships these ratios are encouraging and are reaching world&hyphen;class standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the crewing factor stands at 2.13 compared with an international benchmark of 1.7. These crewing measures are the number of crew required to fill one berth. That is an interesting comparison. If you look at the berthing required over a 12-month period, you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="972"> find that a high proportion of these crew members are on generous leave provisions. They are either on sick leave, long service leave, training or holidays, which is part of the award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the strike arrangements on the waterfront and the shipping industry now under the MUA, you see that there is a very strong connection between those groups. If one group is not getting its way, it encourages the other group to support it. Over the last three or four years we have seen the activities of the MUA on the waterfront and nationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Workforce</EMPHASIS>, an industrial relations newsletter, a remarkable situation is claimed. A survey of international shippers found that Australia was the second worst country in the world for strikes affecting shipping and that 23 per cent of the strikes which affected international shipping originated in Australia. That is the figure as reported by this international newsletter; a figure which most people in Australia would come to understand as being true and correct. The recent activities of the MUA really indicate their muscle. Comments last week to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicate that they are prepared to use their particular type of industrial muscle to achieve any outcome they think is to their benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me draw to the attention of the House the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority program, where $450 million was paid out to 4,000 retiring wharfies. What other industry pays out this amount of money to ensure the retirement of this number of people?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HOLLIS" NAMEID="DH4">

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VH4">Mr McARTHUR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just giving you the facts. The member for Throsby would understand this. Certainly a lot of money has been paid just to achieve a more efficient end. Another $17 million was spent on redundancies in the shipping industry under the Shipping Industry Reform Authority. So the taxpayer has consistently paid for the waterfront and shipping industry to lift its competitiveness. And what real competitiveness have we achieved?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about the second register and note some of the associated arguments. I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know honourable members opposite have pretty strong views about foreign crews and the removal of cabotage, and I guess that is an argument for another day. I also want to talk about the Maritime Union of Australia and a list of some `outrageous proposals' in their publication of January-February 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are saying that John Howard's government is proposing a list of outrageous coalition proposals. These include a second Australian register and non-union labour on the wharves&mdash;how outrageous! Also included is port privatisation, an end to cabotage, an end to the trans-Tasman accord and an immediate sale of ANL&mdash;how terrible that is! It is losing great amounts of money and should have been sold two or three years ago. Also mentioned is a watered&hyphen;down unfair dismissal law&mdash;what a terrible thing to be suggesting, that we change the unfair dismissal law! Another proposal is a deregulated labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further on in this document, Mr Terry Shaw tells his members why they should vote for the ALP. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Howard says he wants to bring non-union labour onto the waterfront. And he would open the Australian coastline to foreign ships . . . He would also look at setting up a second register or flagging out Australian vessels and he would privatise our ports. A Howard Government would reintroduce the secondary boycott legislation to make it easier for employers to sue the union.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know the arguments about the secondary boycott legislation, and I am delighted to support John Howard on that particular approach. I also want to talk about the shipbuilding industry and the subsidies that might be applied. I also want to refer to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Shipbuilding Industry: In the Wake of the Bounty</EMPHASIS> . I note that the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), is at the table. I compliment him on that very good committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, and this very good report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the attention of the House to some of the recommendations which I think stand up to debate on both sides of the House. The shipbuilding industry in Australia, as we observed it, had some problems, but it was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="973"> certainly not the taxpayers' dollars that would make it more efficient or world competitive. As the honourable member at the table would recall, we looked at the aluminium construction in Devonport, we looked at the Anzac frigate ship construction by Amecon at Williamstown and we noted that the 1988 Industries Assistance Commission concluded that the bounty enabled industry to enter export markets but did not encourage a viable, efficient industry. They are very telling words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another comment was that the provision of capital to the shipping industry was a problem. As the shadow minister at the table would well recall, we had a number of discussions with shipbuilding industry leaders about the problem of obtaining capital for shipbuilding on a world basis. Other nations around the world were getting subsidies from governments and cheap loans at low interest rates. That was a major impediment to the Australian shipping industry&mdash;especially at that time, when interest rates were in the range of 23 per cent. They pointed out to us that that was a very great difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of training, this committee thought naval architecture was something that needed to be improved. We were impressed with the state-of-the-art training of naval architects here in Australia, in both the smaller and the larger shipping industries. The level of skills and understanding that was displayed there was very encouraging for the development of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another factor in the whole argument was the encouragement coming from the Department of Defence towards the Australian shipbuilding industry. The key element here was whether Defence would place orders and help develop an efficient Australian shipbuilding industry, as they did with the Anzac frigate project in joint venture with New Zealand. That starting point from Defence, with the setting up of the contract for the six frigates, meant that systems were developed, capital was invested in that Williamstown dockyard and ships of world quality were produced and will continue to be produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The committee members were particularly impressed with the change in the new modu lar construction. All of us well recall our visit to the Williamstown dockyards and the changes that were taking place in computer aided design. What was more important was the contribution by Dr John White, the then manager of those dockyards, and the remarkable change in the industrial relations climate. That change was brought about by the good management of Amecon and the workers' dramatic change in attitude towards their relationship with management. I wish to put on the record my pleasure in and keenness for those changes that took place. They turned around what was formerly a hopeless situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee produced a number of arguments about the position of the shipbuilding industry in Australia. The position of the industry depended very much on a change in industrial relations, and that change was clearly demonstrated in the Amecon shipyard. It depended on innovative technology&mdash;such as the technology that was introduced in the aluminium shipbuilding industry both in Tasmania and in Cairns&mdash;and it depended upon new and innovative designs. The catamarans that were produced in Tasmania have now found a niche market internationally and, whilst there have been some teething problems with one or two of them, they are now selling in Europe and in North America. That is a great feather in the cap of the shipbuilding industry in Australia and is something that all Australians and all members of this House should be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thrust of what I am saying is that it will not be taxpayers' dollars that will make the shipbuilding industry efficient&mdash;there will be relatively benign taxation regimes. The availability of finance, the entrepreneurship of shipbuilders and the dramatic change in industrial relations which the Howard government will produce will put the Australian shipbuilding industry on its feet. The efficiency in this industry will not come from the subsidies that this bill is proposing, including the subsidisation of ANL. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>We had a protracted debate about these matters when the parliament last sat, and I essentially covered these issues at that time. Although it was not a cognate debate, by indulgence I was given the opportunity to make some general remarks. Those remarks obviously canvassed the importance of committees as the government sees them. We are keen to see the committees established. There has been substantial debate about representation on the committees. For the information of the House, I advise that the committee structure generally has followed the conventions of this House, so representation is on the basis of the numbers in the House&mdash;in other <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="975"> words, effectively reflecting the election result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By indulgence, I wish to comment on one related matter. There has been some debate as to whether or not members of the opposition should be included as a requirement in any quorum. If I can refer to this issue now, I will then not need to refer to it upon the moving of the amendments. There is no precedent for that. That has never been the situation in the House. Obviously, where a notice of a meeting is given, that notice is given to all members of the committee and they have every right to be there in attendance. On that basis, obviously we will not be accepting that unprecedented proposal. The committee structure works quite well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think that generally committees have not operated on such a party political basis. They have attempted to draw on the merits of the issues rather than draw on party political views. For that reason, we will not be accepting such a proposal. I otherwise commend the motion to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of matters before us tonight. With indulgence, as the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has had to make some general comments, I too wish to make some general comments as they apply to a number of the motions that are before us tonight. The basis of our objection has a common thread. At the appropriate time I will be seeking leave to move a series of amendments but, under each of the motions, to in effect group the amendments for the purposes of the consideration of the House. I understand there is agreement to that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard the Leader of the House argue that there has been ample opportunity for debate in relation to this committee structure. There has not. I make the point at the outset that on the opening day of this parliament the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, after having congratulated the new Speaker, that the importance of reasserting the supremacy of the parliament over the executive was going to be a hallmark of what they are on about, and he also said, `I say that very deliberately.' </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is very keen to remind us about how certain and deliberate he is about all of these commitments, but he was making very much a pitch for the supremacy of the parliament over the executive. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is part of our system of government that the executive is controlled by parliament and parliament controlled by the laws and the customs and conventions of our society. I think it is important that steps are made on both sides of the parliament to reassert and re-establish a degree of respect and regard for the institution.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said on the opening day of parliament. What has been the circumstance in the first sitting fortnight of the parliament? We find a situation in respect of the most significant piece of legislation that this government campaigned on during the last election&mdash;the sale of Telstra&mdash;where they would not let the opposition move amendments when we got to the detail stage of debate. The second reading debate was run out when it came&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said that. I am not taking issue with you about that. What I am taking issue about is that you would not allow the opposition to move amendments. If the parliament is to be supreme, why is it that parliament is being denied the opportunity to deal with the detailed amendments that go to the core of our concern, yet that was the first thing that the government ruled us out on? The second thing I might add is the convention&mdash;which I think is longstanding in this place&mdash;whereby matters of public importance belong to the opposition of the day, not to the non&hyphen;government parties. Yet we had a Deputy Speaker calling an Independent member to second an MPI that we had proposed on gun laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area is that the Leader of the House has made great play of the extra number of questions that have been taken by the government in the course of question time. He boasted proudly of the fact that in the last sitting fortnight they had had 24 questions in each session. Questions they may have been; answers we did not get. In all circumstances, we are still waiting for the answers. If we are going to lift the status of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="976"> the parliament, I would have thought it incumbent upon those who assert that this is what they are on about to have the decency to come into this House and give us some answers. I might say that the average of 24 has dropped pretty significantly this week under the difficulty that the government has been having with some of its ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we were cut short, at 20 questions, because the minister who is sitting at the table with you, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), was floundering around trying to justify the way in which his departmental advice demonstrated the complete opposite to what he was telling the parliament. So much for non&hyphen;answers; we are actually getting wrong information from ministers in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that wasn't enough, in the first fortnight the debate on these committees was reintroduced, after the Leader of the House had introduced it just before question time on Thursday, at 5 o'clock on Thursday afternoon when the House was set to adjourn at 5.30. He then proceeded to gag the debate on the committees. What was gagged through were the committees that had been set up for the House of Representatives. We only dealt with one of the joint committees, that is, committees that are comprised of membership of both this House and the Senate, but we had the gagging of our attempt to move amendments in relation to the joint committees. That is why we are taking time tonight to&mdash;</PARA>

And you sit over there and try to pretend, as the person who is marshalling the Prime Minister's commitment to lift the supremacy of the parliament, but you will not allow the opposition to participate and move its amendments. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Not only did you gag debate on the committees, which is the reason we are here tonight, but you also had the audacity, in the first sitting fortnight, to gag an adjournment. I ask you!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the space of the first sitting fortnight of this government being in power for the first time in 13 years, they come in here and moralise to the world at large about the supremacy of parliament and lifting the standards, they gag our amendments, they gag the amendments in relation to committees, they gag the adjournment, they do not answer questions, and they try to pretend that what they are doing is lifting the standards of parliament. And that was only in the first fortnight. Let's wait and see what happens over the coming weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we actually saw the Prime Minister threaten the Senate. He said, `What audacity of the Senate to move matters into a committee stage,' when the very process by which they are moving into committee stage is the process that you put in place when you were in opposition. What hypocrisy! What cant! Yet you say you want to lift the standards of this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last sitting fortnight we were forced to divide on all of these issues. If the Leader of the House tries to gag our opportunity on these issues tonight, we will resort to the same approach. If they want cooperation they have to extend it. We will not put up with a position in which they assert they will give us a fair go and yet whenever an opportunity arises to cut us down they do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could not move the amendments on the last occasion. We had to move amendments for two reasons: firstly, they did not consult us about the composition of these committees which they have changed; and, secondly, they did not consult the Senate. So they are not only not consulting this side of the House; they are not consulting the other house on joint committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of process is it where you say that you are setting up joint committees, you need cooperation from the other house and this side of the House and yet you do not consult them about it? That is what we are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="977"> annoyed about and it is the reason why we are taking issue with it tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a number of amendments that we wish to move, the thrust of which, in essence, is to challenge the quorum requirements under the new committees. As the committees stand, with a joint committee you can have a quorum of three. But, better than that, you can set up a subcommittee, the quorum of which can be two. Any of those three or two, depending on whether they are constituted as a committee or subcommittee, can make decisions for the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They can have their choice&mdash;they can decide to meet in a telephone box if it is the three&hyphen;person committee, or they can meet walking down the corridor if it is a two&hyphen;person subcommittee. It would be a little cosy meeting of their colleagues. It would not be so cosy in terms of the party room debate that they have been going through over the last 24 hours or so. But the reality is that under the quorum procedures there is no requirement for a non&hyphen;government member, an opposition member, to be present. Yet the Senate standing orders requires such a provision.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You moralise to us about your great consultations with your IR bill. If they are anything like the consultations you have gone on with on the procedures of this House, they are non&hyphen;existent&mdash;and that is a fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, whatever happens to these amendments tonight, they will be amended in the same form in the Senate when these committees get there. Then you will have a stand&hyphen;off in which the Senate says that the quorum requires an opposition member to be present, as it should. Yet this arrogant, non&hyphen;consultative Leader of the House says, `There is no such requirement.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you know how the committee system works because you have served on the committees. I have not served <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the committees but I will do so in the rest of this session. The fact of the matter is that many of my colleagues have, and the whole approach of the committees is to try to get consensus, to get some sort of understanding to find common ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These motions will drive wedges and force a position in which you are not required to consult. You will end up ramming through&mdash;not by weight of numbers, which you clearly have&mdash;some shonky device that says, `Let's refer it to a subcommittee and let me and Snowy walking down the corridor to dinner decide what we will put up to that subcommittee.' It will make a mockery and a nonsense of the committee process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you in the government are serious about arguing that the standards, the form, the role and the responsibility of the House are to be lifted, how can you do it by debasing the very role of the committee structure? Yet that is what these amendments do. We will be moving a series of amendments that give effect to the requirement that the quorum rules insist on at least one opposition member being present when a quorum is held. We believe that this will lend itself to better cooperation on committees, better input, greater preparedness to face up to the issues and will have a better chance of getting consensus.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the amendments. I think the important thing for the House to consider tonight is that what we in the opposition are saying is that all we want is a fair go. We hear from the government a lot of pious propositions, but what the opposition are saying is that we want a reasonable position from which we would be able to contribute to the work of the House. My colleague the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who will follow me in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the debate and who, like me, is a former Speaker of the House, knows about the good work that the committees of this House have done over the years and, one would hope, will do in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem we have had with the government over the last few weeks is that it just wants to tear up most of the previous agreements. The committee system of this House, since it was reformed some years ago, has come down with some very good reports that ministers and the opposition have supported. The committee system has worked as a jewel for this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a long while people considered that the Murphy changes to the Senate system had made the Senate committee system something for the rest of the world to look at. What we tried to do a few years ago was have the House of Representatives committees be as good as, if not better than, that. We set up an integrated system of committees that shadowed what were in those days the larger portfolio groupings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members on both sides took the view that this was a way they could contribute, very properly, to the life of the parliament and the life of the nation. Members on both sides went to the committee system, put aside the animosities that you get in this chamber and said, `What we need to do is to come up with some solutions to issues which both the government and the opposition can agree to.' Ministers in the past have used the parliamentary committee system to address issues that may have been too difficult for the executive government to deal with and too expensive for a commission of inquiry or something like that to deal with. My colleague the member for Cunningham will no doubt expand on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some recollections of being the chairman of what was the first economic committee of this House which was set up by the Fraser government&mdash;the old Committee on Expenditure. It was used by a number of ministers in the Labor government to bring down reports which both sides could agree on and which the government could pick up so that they could get some sensible changes to legislation and to government positions, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="979"> because the committee went out and talked to a whole range of people and solved some of those problems that ministers had found a bit difficult to deal with in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that was one of the best things which the committee system of this House did&mdash;it adopted a bipartisan approach. It said, `Let's try to get on with doing the best for the parliament and the best for Australia.' When we were in government we thought a good way to do that was to involve the opposition in it. We expanded the size of some committees from time to time&mdash;the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade comes to mind. At the time we expanded it we increased the government membership and the opposition membership.</PARA>

We think the way you are going to establish these committees is to gut them of staff. That is what they are going to do&mdash;they are going to do away with the staff.

The government wants to get away from accountability. We have all this pious discussion about how it is accountable, how it is this and how it is that. We have 20 questions without answers, unless the Minister for Finance can read the answers out of his speech notes. What we have is the real system that will look at what the government does. The real accountability system is that we will have fewer opposition members on committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Leader of the House thinks there is no problem with the opposition being involved in the system, I do not know why he does not say, `Well, you can have another member on committees' or `We can allow the quorum system to include a member of the opposition.' Obviously if there were no problem with this, he could accept the amendments of the member for Hotham. But the reality is that this is one of the greatest ramps that has been run through this place.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, I missed the opening remarks of the member for Hotham. I will deal with the position of the Independents, which is that we still have not resolved, as far as we are concerned, a satisfactory method of arriving at agreements in relation to our arrangements. We are obliged, as has been pointed out to us, to operate through the honourable member for Watson, the Chief Opposition Whip. I am not making a reflection on the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly the individual political interests of the Independent members are quite different from those of the opposition party, the Labor Party, and it is not suitable to have our matters or our business dealt with or arranged by the Chief Opposition Whip. Therefore, in responding somewhat to the comments made by the honourable member for Hotham in moving his amendments, I would like to point out that as yet we still have an unsatisfactory situation as far as we are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are still considered, for all intents and purposes, as some sort of appendage to the Labor Party, which is quite clearly wrong. In actual fact we have substantial interests of our own which we want to see represented, and represented in a way that is recognised by the House. Thus far that has not taken place. The Leader of the House (Mr Reith) ought not to take any comfort from that either because thus far he has not done anything about it either. This is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the amendments moved by the Manager of Opposition Business, I would like to say for my part that, as far as the effective workings of committees are concerned, I think it would be detrimental to have a requirement that one of a subcommittee's quorum be an opposition member. Anybody with a modicum of commonsense would realise that that would be a very effective mechanism for stopping the committee system working if that suited the opposition at any particular time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with interest that the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) are sitting on the front bench. I want to make an observation about the difficulties often experienced by members from Western Australia in relation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="983"> to committee work. The member for Fremantle came straight into parliament on the frontbench and she probably has not had any experience with the workings of committees in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most often meetings of committees are organised in the interests of members from the eastern states. Very rarely are the interests of members from Western Australia taken much into consideration. The point I am trying to make is that I can well see the situation where a member flies all the way from Western Australia to a committee meeting in Sydney or Melbourne, which is where they are usually held if they are outside of Canberra, spends half a day travelling, stays overnight, rocks up to the committee meeting in the morning and finds out that, because an opposition member is not there, the subcommittee will not go ahead.</PARA>

It was a bit of luck that we managed to scrape together a quorum so that the business of the committee could go ahead.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of the debate over the business of committees, I point out that very rarely are the interests of the outlying state members taken much into consideration. I am sure that the member for Perth, as a member from Western Australia and one who has had a long interest in trying to ameliorate the problems encountered by members from Western Australia, would support my view that, if you had a mechanism built into the standing orders that would sabotage the effective running of subcommittees of committees, that would not be in the interests of members coming from the outlying states because they could well have the experience, as I almost did, of turning up for a three&hyphen;hour meeting, having travelled virtually all day and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> staying overnight, which is not going to go ahead because it lacks a quorum.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition has a clear tactic. We could have had the opportunity tonight for opposition members to speak to these motions and we were quite happy to do so. I noticed that one of the speakers during the earlier debate said that we had rammed these matters through. The truth is that we put time aside when parliament sat 10 days ago. The opposition set out to spend the whole time in divisions to prevent their own people speaking to the motions so that they could then stand up and say we were undermining our own pledge in respect of parliamentary standards. It is absolutely incredible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So determined are they to make this ridiculous claim that, having said how important the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee structure is, they have just voted against the establishment of a parliamentary committee. The whole basis of their claim is that they do not like the proportions of members on the committees. The fact is that the proportions on the committees are a direct reflection of the numbers in the House&mdash;which are, of course, a direct reflection of the way in which the people voted in the 2 March election. So what they don't like is the election result. They think this is a good basis on which to run a series of divisions. It is absolutely laughable, Madam Deputy Speaker, and as you are such an impartial chairman I have no doubt you will nod knowingly in regard to what I am saying.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not for me to want to try you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I will continue to address all my remarks through the chair. So their first argument is they do not like the election result and they want a change which has never been undertaken in the House. We are just following the precedent. We are doing what every government has done, what every parliament has done, in every election since 1901.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second proposition is they say that when you have a quorum an opposition member must be a member of the quorum. No&hyphen;one has ever proposed that before. They have fabricated this idea and then they come in here and feign concern about parliamentary standards. It is absolutely laughable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad I was sitting down when I heard the honourable member complain about question time. Today we had 20 questions. I have been in and out of the parliament and then I was back in again. Since I was sworn in in February 1985, I can never remember one question time when we had 20 questions given and answered. And they are complaining about question time! The piece de resistance from the opposition was when they said we had threatened the Senate. Yet, for years and years, we have listened to your side call the Senate absolutely everything under the sun, including an unrepresentative swill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You keep talking about parliamentary standards. In fact, your behaviour now is just <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="987"> a carryover of your poor standards in the whole time that you were in government. When you look at this debate, you see that in 1987 the parliament established the committee structure as it now is. That structure had bipartisan support and the motions that have been before the chair are a continuation of that practice and convention in respect of the committees. I have read the debate from back in 1987 when we established the committees. We had 39&half; minutes of constructive discussion about the establishment of the committees and that was, as I say, a turning point with a new committee structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far on this debate, when we sat about 10 days ago we had 1&half; hours set aside, most of which was spent in having divisions. Then tonight we had put aside 1&half; hours or two hours, whatever it was, so that everybody could have their say. I said to the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean), `Everybody can have their say, or you can spend the whole night having gags and divisions. Which one is it going to be?' And what do we have? We have gags and divisions. It is absolutely pathetic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason you are doing this is so that you can go up into the gallery and say that the government is not maintaining parliamentary standards. Over the years I have seen juvenile behaviour. Your problem is that you have a whip whose whole record in government was to abuse the processes, the forms and the conventions of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have now moved this motion so that we can at least make some genuine effort to provide people with an opportunity to speak to this particular set of motions. We are not proceeding with the committee of which the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has been chairman. He is entitled to have his say. But for the moving of this procedural motion, quite frankly, he would not have had that opportunity. By moving this particular procedural motion, at least the House can have half an hour or thereabouts discussing these issues and the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who also wants to speak, can have his say. Your childish pranks at running a filibuster come to naught. I therefore commend this procedural motion to the House.</PARA>

<ROLE>Management of Opposition Business)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.28 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We oppose the suspension of the standing orders. The reasons advanced by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) are completely fatuous. To argue that this House has had the opportunity to debate these issues on the establishment of committees is nonsense. These motions were first introduced into this House at 5 o'clock on the last sitting Thursday. The gag was moved before 5.30&mdash;half an hour of debate to establish eight House of Representatives standing committees. Is that a proper course of action? Does that demonstrate a commitment to the supremacy of the parliament over his executive decision as to what the constitution will be? He tries to come into this place and say there should be ample time for debate, but only 40 minutes was allowed tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in total, in establishing all of these committees we have had a little over an hour of debate. Do you know how long it has taken to actually get the first one carried by voting procedures? More time than enabled us to have a debate. More time was spent on procedures because of your arrogance, because of your ignoring the form of the House and because of your trying to deny the opposition the opportunity to move amendments, and this is what you have got. The fact of the matter is that it is not correct to say that the opposition has voted the committees down. What we have voted down is your ability to conduct secret meetings under the guise of parliamentary committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have introduced procedures into this House whereby a committee can comprise three people or two people. You can have your secret meetings in a telephone box or in the corridor. There is no requirement for anyone in the opposition parties or on the opposition side to comprise that quorum. Yet when we talk about the joint committees where there is a requirement not just to take account of our position on this side of the House, the opposition in the House, what about the Senate? Don't you consider it part of the joint process? Yet it has standing orders&mdash;standing orders that require an opposition member to comprise the quorum.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="988">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a procedure&mdash;and I think the backbench ought to understand this of the government side&mdash;that asserts that it is establishing committee processes here, joint committee processes, which will be voted down in the Senate. If you think that is smart, do it. If you do not think that is wasting time, then you are not understanding the procedures. We will be back here in this chamber&mdash;forget about how long these divisions might take&mdash;debating what the Senate sends back to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is absolute nonsense to assert the supremacy of the House, to say that the executive is really leaving these decisions to the House when, in actual fact, the government is ramming these procedures through and not allowing debate. We on our side have always said that the importance of these committees is paramount. We have said that we want to participate constructively in them. We have said that we want to be available and not squeezed out by secret cabals organising their shoddy little meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard the member for Moore (Mr Filing) talk about how difficult it is for people to get across from Perth. Well, I tell you, brother, you will get not a look in; you will not even be able to book the air ticket by the time they have conducted their meeting down the corridor. They will have convened the thing, closed the shop&mdash;and you still will be at the booking agency trying to get on the plane. That is what they are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that is besotted with the circumstances of its election victory. We recognise that you won the election. We may not like it; that is true in terms of what the Leader of the House says. But the fact is that we recognise it. We have never argued that you should not have majorities on these committees&mdash;never argued that at all. What we have argued though is, if you are going to increase the size of them, why not increase the size to accommodate opposition members as well, not just government members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This cannot be a winner&hyphen;take&hyphen;all situation. This has to be a recognition that there are two sides to this House&mdash;and some argue three. But for the purposes of this debate there are two sides. If you expect cooperation, if you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expect a lifting of the standards of this place, there has to be dialogue entered into with us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House talks about the approach that we are taking here. We do not take this deliberately. We take it in a reactive way, in a way that leaves us no choice because of the stupidity with which you have chosen to bring this forward. These committee issues have been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for some time. But when were they introduced into the House? The Leader of the House introduced them just before question time on Tuesday. He filibustered up until question time was convened so that we could not get our say in before question time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House then came over to me and said, `We need some of the inaugural speeches, the first speeches up; can we get a few with the Address&hyphen;in&hyphen;Reply?' I said, `Sure, we'll cooperate with that.' And we did. We said, `We'll cut a deal on the basis that you give us an extra position, one extra position, to accommodate all non-government members.' We put that proposition in terms of the House of Representatives. But he would not deal. Then he has the gall to say that we are not compromising, that we are not prepared to recognise their mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is: your view is `take it or leave it'. Your approach with this&mdash;the same as it is with the industrial relations bill&mdash;is to pretend consultation, to list all the times you have had discussions with people and to argue that that demonstrates a preparedness to involve, to consult. But you do not mean it. You are going through a sham. You have one view in life, your view, and you are prepared to ram it through at any cost.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is not only the opposition; the other non-government members have been ignored entirely. By default or compliance, the opposition have been a party to that. Perhaps they might consider their position on that some time when they are all getting overawed with democracy. You could be forgiven for thinking that the government's professed commitment to reinvigorating parliamentary practices was merely a euphemism for revenge&mdash;revenge on the parliamentary Labor Party which, I must say, was equally ruthless in using its numbers in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I will say this for the now opposition: I do not recall their having to resort to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gag on one occasion over the last 12 to 18 months. Having reorganised the way this parliament approaches its business, they did not, to the best of my recollection, resort to the gag.

It is an indictment of the government, but the chap at the table who giggles and squiggles his way through this debate deserves the greatest condemnation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not wish to take up time, but I might with a little bit of encouragement from those opposite. It would be indicative of the sense of decency towards the parliamentary processes, which is what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised in the most unequivocal terms on more than one occasion in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perhaps an indication of what is to come that they will allow me to speak for an extra moment or two in this debate. I am speaking in the knowledge that it is going to be cranked off when I sit down, and perhaps one member or other members will have an opportunity to discuss or to contest the gag that is now before the House.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That the following words be added to paragraph (8) of the motion relating to a proposed Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade: ", 2 of whom shall be opposition members".</PARA>
<PARA>This motion goes to the very heart of the issue which we are considering here tonight: quorum requirements for committees which are established. This amendment seeks simply to have two of the six members forming a quorum for this committee to be from the opposition. It is not an unrealistic ask. It is not in the broad scheme of things asking too much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House (Mr Reith) made a number of comments a little earlier in respect of this whole issue of committees, and I would like to add one or two points to those comments he addressed to the House. Firstly, I wish to pick up the point as to why, for example, an amendment which increases the number of opposition members associated with committee work is of great value. Comments were made, and I think at one stage the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) interjected and asked what would the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) know about the workings of committees in this place. I can tell the member for Corangamite that I know a little about that, having for nearly the 12 years I have been here, save the three years I was Speaker, served on many of those committees and having been a Speaker who felt the committee system served this parliament very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I know the honourable member for Corangamite has an interest in committees, because he worked closely with me on a number of committees in recent years. I say to the honourable member that, through committees, we can achieve a reasonable outcome in this parliament. For example, I chaired the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Admin istration and, in my view, this committee demonstrates very clearly the way in which the committee system can assist the parliamentary process. In the course of this committee's inquiries, 14 reports were done on a variety of subjects. For instance, there was a review of the Australian banking industry, which resulted in something like 108 recommendations of which, I think, 105 were adopted by government. There were inquiries into the Australian Customs Service, sports funding and administration&mdash;which still is the basic parameter by which sports funding in this country from the federal government's perspective is planned&mdash;and tax evasion, offshore tax havens and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In every one of those cases, bar one, there was bipartisan support for those reports. The only minor dissenting report came from the then honourable member for Boothby who, for some reason, did not like one of the recommendations we put forward in the banking inquiry. The rest of those 14 committee reports involved important issues: tax evasion, regulation of the Australian banking industry, the Australian Customs Service and the way it supports this country at the barrier, sports funding and so on. All of those issues were approached from a bipartisan perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to throw all of that away, if you are going to throw away everything that has happened in the committee system that has been augmented and supplemented particularly since 1987 to specifically give backbenchers something to do, then you have to support what the government is proposing. But if you want to maintain backbench interest, if you want to maintain genuine support from the opposition so the bipartisan nature of inquiries can be pursued without the nonsense that goes on in a partisan fashion when you are chasing a minister down a rabbit hole or whatever over a specific issue, if you want to make a contribution in this place, then you support the sensible amendment that the opposition is proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Committees work through bipartisan support from government and opposition members. Evidence is taken on the public record. People are asked what they would like to see government do. We all stand up and say what we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="998"> would like to see government do both in this place and out in the broad community. But committees actually do that. If we can get bipartisan support for committee recommendations, would it not make the government's job just a little bit easier? Is it not a worthwhile process, if we have opposition members supporting majority committee reports which are brought down and recommended to the government? But, if the opposition are shut out because quorum requirements are brought in, whereby government members&mdash;and only two of them at that&mdash;can get together in secret, in private, and can have a yarn about some recommendations and then put them forward, does the opposition participate in a fair and reasonable way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all been on committees in this place. We have all&mdash;whether in government or opposition&mdash;had the chance to be involved in contributing to what we think we are supposed to do here. We come to this place to speak on behalf of our constituents, yes. But we also come here to look at ways in which we can make government better, and we can do that in a bipartisan fashion through the committee system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might just say something about the broad thrust of this. I am sorry the clerk has actually ducked out. It would surprise me if the clerk does not have a view about the committee system in this place and has not made that view known to the government of the day. It would surprise me if he did not say to the Leader of the House that setting up committees is a great opportunity for backbenchers, both government and opposition, to participate, provided the committees are resourced properly.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FILING" NAMEID="QT4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the Independents.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And, indeed, the Independent members. But what about the resources? Is the government going to say, `Yes, we will have all these committees and we will increase the numbers of government members on it, but what we are going to do is cut into resources. We are going to take away the people that work in the committees so that you actually do not do anything.' In name only will you have more government members on committees because you have an inflated <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> backbench during this term, and that is only one way you are going to keep them happy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be surprised also if the clerk has not suggested to the Leader of the House and others that they seriously consider this when coming up with some options for the $2 million savings that are going to be imposed on the Department of the House of Representatives, not to mention&mdash;as we are talking about joint committees&mdash;the $2 million also in the Department of the Senate. Have members on the government side&mdash;those that have been here for a while and those who have been on committees&mdash;actually sat down and thought what it means to have the government of the day say to the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate&mdash;forgetting the other departments for the moment; I am only concerned about these because we are talking about committees&mdash;`By the way, you are going to have to find $2 million worth of savings,' at the same time saying to the government and the parliament, `We want to have an enhanced committee system but we are not going to give you the resources'? Where is the logic in that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were looking at ways in which you might save some money here in the Department of the House of Representatives, in the Department of the Senate or in joint committees, the thought could have come to the minds of some people that we do not need as many of these committees that have been proposed now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know why they are there. I am not for a minute suggesting that committees are not worth while because, as I have already stated, they are. And I will stand up in any forum in this country or elsewhere&mdash;and indeed I have&mdash;to say that the committee system of the parliament of Australia is amongst the best in the world because of its participatory nature and what it gives people in this place a chance to do. But the difficulty that you are always going to be faced with is: if you have a large number of people on one side of the parliament, how do you keep them all happy? The simple way is to say, `Let's create a few more committees. Let us send them all over Australia and give them a couple of inquiries. Do not give the resources <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="999"> to the committee secretariat so that you can do it, but let us have a few more committees.' Does that help the $2 million saving option that the House of Representatives is going to have to find?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is not there, the question needs to be asked, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;as I am sure you and your colleague the Speaker will be asking yourselves in the coming weeks&mdash;`Where else can we find those savings?' I am sorry to say that I think it is going to be in services provided to members in this place. I think it is going to fall largely on members' services. It is already going to fall on committee staff; that is as clear as day. There is no doubt about that from this motion proposed by the government tonight on all of these committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where else are these savings going to be made? As I say, I would be very, very surprised if the clerk of this place, who has been around a long time and knows the ins and outs and the workings of this place backwards, did not make some very sound and cogent recommendations to the government about how that might be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did the government listen? No. One of the things we are going to debate here a little later is starting up a Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Why couldn't that have been done in the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade? Why did you have to create another committee? Is it because the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) suddenly missed out on getting a job somewhere, so you have to have a committee for him? That will probably be found out to be the reason behind all this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that do in spreading resources that are already stretched in the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate to meet the needs of members and senators in this place so they can do their job of representing the people of Australia? How is that going to make the committee system any better if you spread the resources thinly and create extra committees? What you end up doing is simply saying, `We have a lot of people over here on the government side. We have to dispense a little bit of largesse around the place. We have to give <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee chairmanships to a few more people so they can rack up a little extra.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is that really what this committee system has come to in this place? I genuinely hope not because, as I said, the committee system in this parliament, since 1987 particularly&mdash;as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) knows&mdash;has served this place well. All those sorts of inquiries over the long time that committees have been conducted in this parliament have been an outstanding success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ministers in this place, past and present, probably do not like the idea of some of these committee inquiries because inquiries suddenly find out a few things that maybe should have been done a bit better. But isn't that what accountability is all about in this place? Isn't that what the people of Australia want of their parliament, for it to be a bit more accountable?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am talking about only one amendment that has been proposed, but this goes to the very heart of our committee system. If we are talking about the bipartisan nature of the committees and about having meaningful inquiries which the government of the day refers to those committees for investigation so that any legislation that might come as a result of those inquiries goes through this place much more smoothly, doesn't it make a lot of sense to try to smooth that passage? Doesn't it make a lot of sense to say that if we can give the quorum requirements some sense of balance and fairness, where the opposition and the Independent members get a fair go, the committee system will operate more effectively in this parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, the Leader of the House does not think so. He has invoked strange sorts of proposals. He is cutting out the role of the opposition and Independent members and their responsibility to participate. It is rather sad because most people in this place who have been here for a time like to believe that the committee system works effectively and makes a valuable contribution. It goes to the issue which the Prime Minister has talked about, the primacy of the parliament over the executive. The committee system in this parliament goes to that sense of primacy&mdash;and it should always do so. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

We also did a very short report on Bosnia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely tragic that, when talking about re&hyphen;establishing this committee, already two of the four subcommittee secretaries have been removed. It was one of my pleasures in the last parliament to convene a meeting of chairmen and deputy chairmen of subcommittees to look at future options. Without the staff those subcommittees will be seriously diminished, will not be as effective and will not make the same sort of contribution. That will be a pity for both the parliament and the Australian people, as they will be the real losers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) has very strong views about why a treaties committee should be established. He might kindly acknowledge that it was my committee, in a bipartisan report, that recommended greater parliamentary scrutiny of treaties. I certainly support that intention of the honourable member for Tangney. But, if you establish specialist parliamentary committees, why not refer treaties to a specialist committee whereby some expertise could be brought to bear? To pick up the point made by the honourable member for Cunningham, such a move to establish a new committee reduces the resources. After all, committees will only be effective to the degree that you resource them. If we are talking about an improved, more accountable parliament, we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1001"> are really talking about a stronger committee system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier that I do not agree that we need as many committees. The committee system has contributed greatly to the functioning of this House; but the committee system is in need of reform. Yet we heard nothing about this from the incoming government, which has established one new committee but has not reviewed the number of committees and their staffing, except to reduce their staffing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the honourable member for Tangney and I disagree about the way committees are strangled and harassed by standing orders that prevent the committees from having far more dialogue with the Australian people. The committee system is evolutionary and we do not want to just leave it as it is. We ought to continually develop and refine it. But here we have the government saying it wants better parliamentary performance, higher standards and greater scrutiny but it wishes to deny us the very mechanism by which these things can be delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said in an earlier contribution that I thought it would be great if the Speaker and the government would look at providing the committees with a new position so that graduates could take up a one&hyphen;year contract. For example, honours graduates from different universities could come to the committees, learn about the committee system, get the benefit of all that experience and make a great contribution to the committee system, with committees utilising their skills. They could then go on to the job of their choice, but credentialled with 12 months experience of working in the parliamentary committee system. This would be one way of trying to maximise the resources available to the committees. But there is absolutely nothing from the government about that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) chaired that same committee at the end, and brought down a report on reforming the funding and administration of the Family Court. Again, I think it is fair to say the Attorney&hyphen;General made a contribution to that. We are looking forward to the government response. I think members on both sides of the House know that family law reform is urgent. It has been through parliamentary committees&mdash;the first one under the chairmanship of Senator Jim McKiernan, and more recently under the chairmanship of the member for Bonython and me&mdash;that we have been able to point out to ministers the need for change and reform. We have done it in a very difficult area but in a very bipartisan way. There was a lot of argy&hyphen;bargy about the recommendations but we were able to come up with a report that we could all live with, a report that we felt made a contribution to change and the reform process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that, when the Attorney&hyphen;General rises to make a contribution to this debate, he will declare himself in favour of the committee system, he will declare himself in favour of adequately resourcing the committee system and that he will declare himself in favour of ensuring that the committees become even more relevant and accessible to the Australian people, so that their concerns and needs can be heard and picked up by this parliament and translated into recommendations for policy change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the government enjoy a very substantial majority as a result of the last election. But I think they need to be mindful of the concerns of opposition members and the way in which opposition members may <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1002"> wish to contribute to the committee system. I cannot conceive of a time in the last parliament when you would wish to have a set of standing orders that allowed you to form subcommittees comprising only government members. I fail to understand why in this parliament the government, knowing full well that a number of the committees have subcommittees, would wish to empower those subcommittees to meet without any opposition member being present. That is exactly what the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has tried to do. Of course, it is exactly what the honourable member for  Cunningham and, earlier in the debate, the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), pointed to, objected to and rectified by way of amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly support these amendments. I still live in the hope, notwithstanding the horrible start of the new government, that it will lift the standards of the parliament by making the parliament more relevant and more accountable. The government has made a dreadful start. I know that the Speaker himself&mdash;I am sure you, too, Mr Deputy Speaker, would support his desire&mdash;wants to achieve all these aims, but you cannot do it in isolation. It does require the cooperation of the government. I hope that, in subsequent debates or in motions moved by the Leader of the House, we will see standing orders that progress this parliament and the committee system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sincerely trust that the cuts that have already been made to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the Public Accounts Committee will be rectified. If not, the people of Australia will conclude that this government does not want committees to be effective, that it does not want to have its actions scrutinised, that it does not want to have policy areas opened up to the people of Australia in the way the Labor government attempted in the last and previous parliaments, and that it does not want to have the parliament itself expressing those views and making recommendations for policy changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not the case that in the last parliament reports favoured the government or were somehow kind to existing ministers. In fact, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I have to be very frank in saying that, certainly in the family law area, I was very disappointed with the half&hyphen;hearted response by the minister at the time. I know I disagreed with some of the government responses to the reports that we brought down in the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, but the nature of the beast is that you are not always going to get your recommendations up first round. At least you are building support&mdash;and, hopefully, bipartisan support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I say that I am grateful, on the fourth attempt, to have made a contribution. I am disappointed with the start that the government has made but, Mr Deputy Speaker, like you and Mr Speaker, I live in hope that the aspirations announced during the election period will come to pass and that we will eventually see different standing orders emanating from the government side.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of comments I would like to make in response to the member for Chifley. One is that I believe, like he does, that the committee system in the previous parliament did some excellent work. The report on the Child Support Agency I think was a very thorough piece of work. I would correct him, however, on his suggestion that I am responsible for a response to it. That falls within the portfolio of the Assistant <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1003"> Treasurer (Senator Short); it is not for me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is somewhat ironic that, despite the alleged commitment of the opposition to the committee system, they have been at great pains to avoid a continuation of the debate on the committee system itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent decades there have been many significant changes in the law and among them is its increasing internationalisation. Treaties are an integral part of this process of globalisation. However, under successive Labor governments there developed a sense of inevitability and an almost indecent haste in the manner in which Australia joined treaties. It was not so much a case of `If you can't beat them, join them' but more a sense of being left behind or losing influence if Australia did not join a major multilateral treaty soon after its adoption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When in opposition, the current government and the Australian community were concerned that adequate scrutiny, both of the obligations under treaties and of their effects on Australia, was being sacrificed in the quest for speedy ratification. The treaty making practices of the previous government were geared <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> towards such expedition. Indeed, the speed with which Australia could become a party to a treaty was promoted as a virtue in itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This quest for speed meant there was an absence of openness and also inadequate parliamentary and community involvement in the treaty process. Comprehensive information about treaties was also hard to come by. When it was made available, it was frequently after Australia became a party to a treaty rather than before. The results were suspicion and misunderstanding about treaties, both in the community and in state and territory governments, and also less than ideal implementation of certain treaties in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that treaties do bring benefits to the Australian community. However, the treaty making process adopted by the previous government acted to undermine rather than promote those benefits. A matter of particular concern to the government was the inadequacy of the parliamentary involvement in the treaty process. The only role of any significance which parliament had previously was in the passage of legislation to implement certain treaties. However, this was a role which was limited by the content of the treaty obligations. It was also limited by the fact that many of the important treaties to which Australia becomes a party do not require implementing legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as though the coalition was alone in calling for greater parliamentary involvement in the treaty process. Justice Michael Kirby, then President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, in a Department of the Senate occasional lecture last year stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some important treaties have been ratified with little parliamentary or public debate. The growing body of treaty law has an increasing impact on Australian law.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr WILLIAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the ILO. He continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It therefore seems legitimate, in some way, now to involve the national parliament in the superintendence of executive action in respect of treaties. The old rule may have been apt for a time when international law was in its infancy. But nowadays, in economic matters as well as those relevant to human rights, the growth of international law is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1005"> extremely significant and growing even more important.</PARA>
<PARA>Reform of the treaty making process and, in particular, strengthening the role of parliament in that process was an integral part of the government's pre&hyphen;election law, justice and foreign affairs policies. The importance which the government places upon these reforms is evidenced by the swiftness of their implementation. The new treaty making process was announced in both houses of parliament on 2 May, the third sitting day of the new parliament. On the same day the government responded in detail to the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trick or treaty? Commonwealth power to make and implement treaties</EMPHASIS> , that is, within five sitting days of the tabling of the report on 29 November 1995&mdash;a pace rarely matched by the honourable members opposite when in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key element of the government's moves to give the parliament a greater role in relation to treaties is the establishment of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, this being the subject of one of the motions under debate. The motion to establish that committee is similar to that which I tabled in the House of Representatives in November last year. It would require the committee to report on matters arising from treaties and related national interest analyses presented to the parliament, any question relating to a treaty or other international instrument referred to the committee by either house of the parliament or a minister and such other matters as may be referred to the committee by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the numbers on the committee from the government and the opposition side, the numbers in the present motion reflect exactly the motion that I moved in opposition. In other words, we do not see any different situation in government from what we saw in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal issue for the joint standing committee will be whether it would be in Australia's interest for it to become a party to a treaty. In order to reach a conclusion on that issue, the committee will need to analyse the implications for Australia of it becoming a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> party to a particular treaty. In so doing, the committee will be assisted by the national interest analysis, which will be tabled with each of the treaties. This national interest analysis is yet another innovation resisted with fervour by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An inquiry into a proposed convention would also provide an opportunity for examination of whether appropriate action had been taken or was being taken in relation to any legislation required to implement the convention. Indeed, the commitment to ensuring legislation to implement treaties is in place prior to taking binding treaty action is another core element of the government's treaty policy. It is a point worthy of elaboration in a few moments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very few people would forget the breathtaking arrogance of the previous government in 1992 in its ratifying ILO convention 158, concerning termination of employment at the initiative of the employer. Very few people would also assert that ratification of that convention was a necessary consequence of the process of globalisation, which I mentioned earlier. Rather, the sole purpose of ratification was to obtain constitutional power in an area which was previously the province of the states. The current government accepts that additional constitutional power may be a consequence of becoming a party to a treaty. However, it does not accept that a decision to become a party to a treaty should be motivated solely by the additional constitutional power thereby gained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ratification of ILO convention 158 is also the most blatant example of the disregard of the previous government for the need to have implementing legislation in place prior to the ratification of a treaty&mdash;that is, the sensible practice that Australia should not become a party to a treaty and thereby accept obligations under that treaty until it has legislation and practice in place to enable it to give effect to the treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basic reason for this practice is that, where legislation&mdash;be it Commonwealth or state&mdash;is necessary to give effect to the provisions of a treaty, it cannot be anticipated that the relevant legislature will pass the legislation. If Australia became a party to a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1006"> treaty on the assumption that certain implementing legislation would be passed and it was not, then Australia would be left in breach of the treaty. This can be particularly embarrassing if there is no provision for withdrawal from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cavalier approach adopted by the previous government to the timing of implementing legislation seemed at odds with the importance which it claimed it placed on compliance with its international obligations. In stark contrast, the Howard government will ensure that the necessary legislation and practice&mdash;be they state or federal&mdash;are in place prior to the taking of the relevant binding treaty action. The national interest analysis will address that question specifically and, as I noted earlier, it is one of the issues which will be considered by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia becomes a party to many treaties each year. The proposed joint standing committee could not conduct full inquiries into all of them. For example, many treaties, such as bilateral air services agreements, investment protection agreements and double taxation agreements, are of the template variety&mdash;that is, the fundamental provisions of each of these agreements remain the same, irrespective of the country with whom they are made. Such treaties are likely to gain bipartisan support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Undoubtedly the joint standing committee will develop procedures for determining whether a more detailed examination of particular treaties is desirable. Nevertheless, the opportunity for the committee to look at every treaty is fundamental to maintaining the integrity of the committee's role and in ensuring adequate scrutiny by this parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee would also provide an opportunity for state and territory governments, industry or community interest groups and individuals to put a point of view in relation to a treaty. Submissions would also normally be invited from relevant government departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and my own department. Hearings of the committee</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>would normally be held in public; however, there would be certain occasions when the matters to be considered by the committee were sensitive. It could be expected that there would be in camera hearings for those sensitive matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) interjects to ask whether there would always be a requirement of a reference to the minister. The answer is no. It is apparent from the motion, if you read the motion, that the committee may of its own motion inquire into treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unanimous recommendations of a bipartisan committee are usually accorded considerable weight by governments. This was certainly true in relation to the government's response to the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee report on treaties which I mentioned earlier. It is expected the same would be true in relation to the recommendations of the proposed Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I reiterate that parliamentary consideration of treaties in the past has been hampered by a lack of information on treaties and by the absence of an opportunity to consider and debate the merits of treaties before Australia took binding treaty action. Given the increasing influence of treaties over matters of concern to the Australian people, these constraints on the participation of parliament were a blight on the democratic process. The recent changes introduced by the government will remove those constraints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tabling of treaties with adequate opportunity for debate prior to ratification, together with consideration of those treaties by a joint treaties committee, the subject of one of these motions, will ensure that the Commonwealth parliament is no longer informed only after the event. It will now have a well-defined and effective role in the treaty making process. I commend that particular motion to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot recall a greater load of pap in this parliament. That highly paid and highly educated people have come up with the idea that somehow the government has suddenly changed the whole game beggars the imagina <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1007"> tion. The fact is that treaties come into the House after they are signed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a load of absolute rubbish this is. The expectation the government has created in the community is that somehow they are going to have treaties discussed in the community and then bring them into parliament. Of course, it is the other way around. The government will sign them first and then tokenistically drop into the parliament and say, `By the way, here they are.' In relation to all that nonsense about traditions and patterns, who established the methodology for treaties and how treaties are treated? Who dealt with that for so long? Not this side of the House. No, not at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That a person who is supposedly held in high esteem in the legal profession can come forward with such a shallow speech really indicates that this government is having trouble finding its feet. I do not know who they have employed. I do not know who writes their speeches. I do not know where they are getting their talent from in terms of their ministerial backup, but they had better go looking again. If that is the best they can do from an Attorney-General, I suggest that their recruitment team have let them down pretty badly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A great disappointment has come from this whole debate during last week and this week. For some years the backbenchers on both sides of this parliament fought and worked very hard to expand our committee system. There was a bipartisan approach to that because we felt it was important and that we had a greater role to play. Many of us have been on a number of committees across a range of areas in a number of parliaments. In those committees we have had members from both sides of the House put forward recommendations to the parliament that were not the policies of any of their parties. That has happened time and again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy about this debate is that the new members of parliament will miss out on the opportunity of having genuine input into public policy making via the parliamentary process. What is being set up here is a shonky system to manipulate the parliamentary process. The committee system is now going to be rorted along political lines and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sovereignty of the committee will be gone. Go back and look at the recommendations of the small business inquiry on capital gains tax as an example. Look through the recommendations of committee after committee which were bipartisan and see how many of them differed time and again with the political positions of the members' parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is being done here will undermine that totally. The committee system is now a creature of the executive. The chair will be appointed by the Prime Minister, for God's sake. No longer will the parties elect their chairs. The Prime Minister&mdash;in other words, the executive&mdash;will appoint the chairs. What has been allowed to happen to the new backbench of the government is they have been rolled over, and they do not even know it. The tragedy is they will miss out on some of the best experiences and some of the most productive work that they could ever do as parliamentarians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am lucky that I have actually been able to do that. I can see that, in the future, that will not be available. Committees are becoming totally politicised. That started in the last few months of the last parliament when legislation was referred to committees that were designed for policy. That has resulted in political committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the numbers, the stacking and the way the quorums work, committees are basically a charade. That really is a tragedy. What we find is that, when we have hearings and discussions around Australia, we hear the same people and we read the same documents. It is remarkable how often we come to similar conclusions, if we are open minded. Creating committees in this climate and in this way means we will not be open minded; we will be closed minded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These committees have been created politically as a creature of the executive, and they will function that way. That last speech absolutely confirms it. That speech was not a speech about the parliament; it was a speech about politics. That is why it was so disgraceful. Creating a committee in that context and for that purpose is purely a political process. The committees that the previous government created, and which we debated in these last <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1008"> few weeks, were created to allow public policy making. A number of times the government of the day did not agree with those committees. So be it, but the record is there, so you can go back and check it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New members should read those reports. They should read the government of the day's response. They should look at what parliamentarians on both sides agreed to and how they differed from their parties. Then you can start to regret that you have allowed yourselves to become manipulated in a way which should not have happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ten years ago we thought that we created a committee system that was a great breakthrough. We actually were resentful of the fact that the Senate could do things we could not do, so we created a worthwhile policy committee structure and, in these last two weeks, we are watching it be destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you are part of it. You are one of the people within those committees. I have been with you on committee hearings. I have agreed with you on matters that both our parties did not agree on. So you know what I am talking about, and so many on the other side do. Why aren't they speaking up? Was all that a sham? Was all that bipartisanship on committees a joke?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I watched the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) laughing and joking his way through the previous business. It is no joke at all to me; it is deadly serious. The best things I have done  in this parliament have been in those committees; the things I am proudest of have been in those committees. Over the years, members on your side have told me the same thing&mdash;that that was their best work. I thought they took it seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can have a revolt on Mabo and on guns&mdash;and I do not doubt that you can have a revolt on chicken meat&mdash;but the most important thing of all is the way in which we process and develop public policy by our committees, and you have rolled over on that. What a disgraceful bunch of wimps. I thought this was going to be a government with some guts and some gusto, but you have rolled over in an area which is yours&mdash;the backbench committee structure. Ministers are not allowed to be on committees. They are owned by the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> backbench. You have let the executive appoint your chairs; you have not done that yourselves. You are letting the executive decide how to run them, and you are creating them in an environment and a climate which is absolutely contrary to their effective functioning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this backbench on the other side are doing is destroying the potentiality for their own fulfilment, production and contribution to national policy making. This is not some party political stunt. Those committees are national public policy committees. When you have a hearing and none of us are there, people who will come are going to see you as a joke. They will see you as politicians, not as policy makers. That is what you are doing: you are making these committees political committees, not policy committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am just warning you, and I will remind you in the years ahead: when serious people come to you with submissions, do not be surprised if they do not take you very seriously. They will recognise you for what you are because of how you have been spawned. You have been spawned in bile; you have been processed in political&mdash;</PARA>

When you come as backbenchers and start complaining on the side about how frustrating it is and how it is not working so well and how life is not as productive as it might have been, just remember what you are doing tonight. You have just lain down and been walked over on the matter of backbench committees by an executive that is organising things to suit the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The less credible these committees are, the more the executive and the bureaucracy will like it, because they do pose a threat. They put a challenge to government and the bureaucracy to perform. But, if they are totally political, there is no challenge at all and no&hyphen;one will take them seriously. That is what you are doing. We saw it in the Senate. We saw many Senate inquiries that were so political they got laughed out of court in the media. We all watched that and we were all angry at what they were doing to the process; but we protected our committees absolutely, and our committees in this chamber are credible in the public mind. We worked hard to keep them <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> credible and did all that work on establishing consensus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening tonight is that the government backbench is lying down and letting the executive take over these committees. Why don't you call them government committees? Why don't you call them cabinet committees? Why not give them another name? Don't pretend that these are owned by the backbench, because they aren't any more; they are owned by the political parties. That is what is being done; the Independents will not matter and we will not matter. I am already hearing about things being referred to them. Don't hold your breath about references from ministers that might be productive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight is actually quite sad and for those who take the system seriously I think tonight is quite a travesty. We have seen tonight, as the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) mentioned earlier, the politics of revenge. In the process of revenge, what we are seeing is destruction. The vengeance that is coming through from the government now is being borne by these committees, which are not part of the problem. They could have been part of the solution, building the credibility of this parliament. That potential has been destroyed tonight and I think many of you will live to regret it. This is just one of many things: revolt on Mabo; revolt on guns; revolt on chicken meat&mdash;but forget the committees because, in your view, they are not very important.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I wanted to make a couple of observations in the debate on specific parts of the motion. In particular, I refer the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) to motion 5 on the proposed Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority. I refer to paragraph (p), which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in carrying out its duties, the committee or any subcommittee, ensure that the operational methods and results of investigations of law enforcement agencies, as far as possible, be protected from disclosure where that would be against the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Having been a member of the joint standing committee for six years in the two previous parliaments, I am a little concerned about the necessity for this provision because it may nobble the committee further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee, as we know, since its inception has had a particular problem in the statutory provisions that created it. That problem happens to be the fact that, in fulfilling its role as the oversight committee of the National Crime Authority, the joint standing committee is at times unable to get the information that it needs to do its job properly. That has been a continual source of concern in the activities of the committee. Paragraph (p) would compound that problem and would make it almost impossible at times for the committee to do its job properly. That is why I am very concerned and interested in hearing any responses that the Leader of the House may care to give on that paragraph.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opportunity for the committee to hear information from the authority around its operational methods and, for instance, specific investigations is already limited by the National Crime Authority Act, which not only created the committee but also limited the information that the committee was able to elicit from the National Crime Authority members.  </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to take up my entire speaking time, but I conclude by saying that in tonight's proceedings the opportunity for considered debate has been considerably limited by the use of the gag. I must admit I am now pleased that we have been able to extend the debate and I acknowledge that fact&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the leader on allowing this debate to go on past 11 o'clock and I think that is a constructive move. I also share the concerns of the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) on the use of the gag. It has loomed large since the commencement of the parliamentary sittings.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the end of the day the opportunity for members to represent their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1011"> constituents is in debate in the chamber. I disagreed with the amendments of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). I thought they would not assist the conduct of the parliamentary committees. But, on the other hand, he is entitled to have them debated. Unfortunately, every time we got to the next provision, the thing was gagged. It was gagged after one hour!</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating it now.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating it now because we have negatived the adjournment. I would be interested, as I said earlier, in learning the reason for the inclusion of this provision. In the last parliament the effectiveness of the joint standing committee, unfortunately, was limited. It is a very important committee. We have seen in recent times attacks on and instances involving the National Crime Authority. These instances have generated much concern in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly there is an expectation in the community that, where you have a joint standing committee that has the oversight of the authority, there should be at least one place where their representatives can do something about it. The problem is that, if we are further constrained by this provision of standing orders, the joint standing committee's effectiveness will be limited. I for one would like to see that explained&mdash;but I would rather see it withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to make the observation that we still are yet to arrive at a satisfactory arrangement for Independent members in debates and, most importantly, in the nomination to committees. We have asked the Speaker and the government to do something about it. The Speaker referred it back to the House&mdash;to the government and the opposition&mdash;but they have failed to do anything about it. We are not opposition members; we are non&hyphen;government members. We have our own rights to represent our interests and constituents' interests as we see fit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is quite inappropriate for us to be considered as some adjunct to the opposition. It is not just a matter for an arrangement between the Chief Opposition Whip and the Chief Government Whip as to how the memberships of those committees be consti tuted; it should be done by arrangement. Certainly, in that case we ought to be consulted and given the opportunity to have our input.</PARA>
