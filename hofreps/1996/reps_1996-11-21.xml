<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill provides a framework for Australia to participate in the international transfer of prisoners. The purpose of the bill is to enable Australians imprisoned overseas and foreign nationals imprisoned in Australia to be returned to their home countries to complete the serving of their sentences. Increases in international air travel and criminal activity have resulted in a rise in the number of persons serving terms of imprisonment in foreign countries. Participation in international prisoner transfers is important for Australia for both domestic and international reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are sound humanitarian and rehabilitative grounds for international prisoner transfers. In addition, such transfers may result in practical benefits in terms of prison administration, as well as relieving some of the pressure on the consular services of Australian missions overseas. It is possible that Australian participation in international prisoner transfers may also result in financial savings for some participating states and territories if there is a net outflow of prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> From the international perspective, a large number of countries are very supportive of prisoner transfer schemes. In recent years, there has been growing pressure for Australia to participate, and Australia has been approached by various countries about this matter. Accordingly, participation in prisoner <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> transfers will enhance and supplement Australia's relations with other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Apart from providing a framework for general transfer of prisoners, the bill will also enable persons who have been convicted by certain international war crimes tribunals to be transferred to Australia to serve their sentences. As honourable members will be aware, two international war crimes tribunals were established in 1993 and 1994 by the United Nations Security Council to deal with war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995 enables Australia to assist and comply with requests from the tribunals, including the arrest and surrender of accused persons to the tribunals, and other assistance such as the taking of evidence in Australia for tribunal purposes. Persons convicted by the tribunals are to serve their sentences in countries designated by the tribunals from a list of countries which have indicated to the Security Council their willingness to accept such prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of countries have already agreed to accept tribunal prisoners, and the President of the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal has sought advice as to Australia's willingness to do so. Australia's acceptance of tribunal prisoners will be subject to the qualification that the prisoners have a connection with Australia. The provisions in the bill enabling transfers from the tribunals will complement the International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>State-Territory cooperation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Clearly, there has been a need to consult closely with the states and territories in the development of this bill. These consultations have taken place through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. As there are no federal prisons, incoming prisoners will need to be housed by prisons controlled by those states and territories which are going to participate in the transfer scheme. Many of the prisoners who will seek to take advantage of the proposed scheme to leave Australia will be serving sentences for state or territory offences. The participating states and territories will need to enact complementary legislation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, the successful participation of Australia in international prisoner transfers will depend to a large measure on cooperation with the state and territory authorities. The states and territories are generally supportive of the scheme. At a recent Standing Committee of Attorneys-General meeting, the participating states and territories endorsed draft Commonwealth and model state-territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Details of bill</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As to the detailed content of the bill, it contains separate provisions for the two different types of prisoners. Parts 3 and 4 deal with general prisoner transfers between Australia and other countries. Part 5 deals with transfers to Australia of tribunal prisoners. Parts 1, 2, 6 and 7 contain general provisions relating to both types of prisoners. The bill provides for all transfers to be considered on a case-by-case basis.</PARA>
<PARA>General prisoner transfers</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I now mention some of the important features of the provisions dealing with general prisoner transfers between Australia and other countries. The bill is drafted in such a way that the transfer scheme is able to apply to all offences without exception. It covers persons who have been convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment or other deprivation of liberty, and includes persons confined in connection with criminal conduct by reason of mental disorder and persons who have been released on parole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A significant requirement is that all transfers must be consensual, requiring the consent of the person to be transferred, the Australian government&mdash;Commonwealth and state-territory where relevant&mdash;and the government of the other country. The bill contains certain prerequisites which must be satisfied before transfers can take place. These include:</PARA>
<PARA>- <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> imprisonment under a final order, whereby neither the sentence of imprisonment nor the relevant conviction is subject to appeal;</PARA>
<PARA>- <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> for transfers to Australia, the person is an Australian citizen or is permitted to travel to, enter and remain in Australia indefinitely pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7174"> and has community ties with a state or territory;</PARA>
<PARA>- <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> dual criminality, whereby the acts or omissions constituting the relevant offence would, if the acts or omissions had occurred in Australia or the other country as appropriate, have constituted an offence in that country; and</PARA>
<PARA>- <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> at least six months of the sentence is remaining to be served.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to these last two conditions, the Attorney&hyphen;General has been given a discretion to waive these requirements in appropriate cases.</PARA>
<PARA>Transfers of Tribunal prisoners</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the provisions dealing with transfers of prisoners from the international war crimes tribunals. There are some differences from the general prisoner transfer scheme. These differences take account of the different nature and objectives of the transfer of tribunal prisoners. The intention is that a tribunal prisoner would not be transferred to Australia unless he or she has some connection with Australia and the Australian government has consented to the transfer. The main differences in relation to tribunal prisoners are that consent from the tribunal prisoner is not a mandatory requirement, and there are no explicit citizenship or migration requirements. On this point, I wish to draw to honourable members' attention that the bill provides that no decision affecting a person who is not an Australian citizen can be made unless the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs consents.</PARA>
<PARA>Sentence enforcement</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A central issue in international prisoner transfers is the question as to how sentences imposed in other countries or the tribunals will be enforced in Australia following transfer. Part 6 of the bill addresses this matter. The bill sets out two different methods for enforcement in Australia of a sentence of imprisonment imposed on a prisoner or tribunal prisoner by a court or tribunal of a transfer country or by a tribunal. These methods are consistent with those set out in the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides that the Attorney-General may direct that the sentence of imprisonment be enforced on the transfer of the prisoner to Australia under the act: without any adaptation or with only such adaptation as is considered necessary to ensure consistency with Australian law&mdash;this is referred to as the continued enforcement method&mdash;or by substituting a different sentence, and this is referred to as the converted enforcement method.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the bill provides for a choice between two different forms of sentence enforcement, the method actually adopted in a particular case will depend on the agreement with the country or the tribunal. For example, if a bilateral treaty with a particular country provides for only one method of sentence enforcement, that method would be used in relation to transfers from that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subject to any agreement to the contrary, I would envisage that Australia would generally use the continued enforcement method. This would involve being bound, so far as possible, by the legal nature and duration of the sentence as determined by the other country, such that a prisoner would bring with him, or her, the sentence from the sending country, minus any time served or remissions earned in the sending country, up to the date of the transfer. The bill contains a discretion for the Attorney-General to make any necessary adaptations to the sentence, although this is subject to the limitation that the sentence to be enforced under either method must not be harsher than the sentence originally imposed. From the date of transfer, the sentence would be generally subject to Australia's law concerning the enforcement of sentences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach adopted in the bill is to treat all incoming prisoners as federal prisoners for administrative convenience and sentence enforcement purposes. It is important to remember that this is not intended to affect the agreed financial obligations as between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. The agreement reached in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is that the states and territories will pay the cost of maintaining incoming prisoners in prison&mdash;unless the prisoners have community ties with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7175"> territories for which the Commonwealth is responsible.</PARA>
<PARA>Application of the legislation and treaty negotiation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation alone will not be sufficient to enable prisoners to be transferred to and from Australia. As I have already mentioned, complementary legislation will need to be enacted by the participating states and territories. In addition, a number of administrative steps will need to be taken&mdash;for example, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has agreed that it may be appropriate to have arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states and territories, defining the relationship between, and the responsibilities of, the Commonwealth and the states and territories in administering the scheme. The bill contains a provision enabling such arrangements to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further requirement is for transfer arrangements to be entered into with other countries. The basis of the bill is that prisoners&mdash;other than tribunal prisoners&mdash;can only be transferred between Australia and `transfer countries'. The bill contains a mechanism by which the act is to be applied to transfer countries. This involves the making of regulations, which may be based on treaty or non-treaty arrangements with other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of countries have already concluded bilateral prisoner transfer treaties. I am advised that some 27 countries are parties to the Council of Europe Convention and that there are also six countries participating in the Commonwealth scheme for the transfer of convicted offenders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Due to cost-effectiveness and scope, it is intended that Australia seek to become party to and implement existing multilateral arrangements such as the Council of Europe Convention and the Commonwealth scheme, and that bilateral treaties be negotiated only with countries which are not parties to a multilateral arrangement to which Australia becomes party, and/or whose preference is for a bilateral treaty or arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA>Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is expected to have little impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> short term. Expenses in relation to transfers to Australia will generally be borne by the participating states and territories. In addition, the bill contains a clause enabling the recovery of the costs and expenses incurred in transferring prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the agreement reached in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, the Commonwealth's costs in relation to general prisoner transfers will include costs of negotiating participation in any appropriate multilateral schemes, bilateral treaties or other transfer arrangements, and the administration of receiving and making requests to other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The costs for the states and territories will include sending escort officers, returning prisoners&mdash;including airfares&mdash;and the cost of maintaining prisoners during the terms of sentences in Australia. The cost arrangements will be different in relation to transfers of tribunal prisoners, since that responsibility arises from international relations and Australia's membership of the United Nations. The Commonwealth will be responsible for the costs associated with transfers from the tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost implications are however not expected to be significant in relation to tribunal prisoners. In relation to general prisoner transfers, there may be significant cost savings to the states and territories if there is a net outflow of prisoners. It is difficult to predict the number of prisoners likely to be moved in and out of Australia once the scheme is operating and, of course, any financial savings will depend upon the actual number of transfers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost implications are therefore unable to be precisely quantified at this stage, but will be examined as part of the agreed evaluation strategy. This will entail a review of the legislation after the scheme has been in place for a period of 12 months to determine the extent to which it has been utilised and to assess the resource implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7176"> The bill is based on strong humanitarian and social considerations, and is the outcome of a cooperative, lengthy and detailed consultation process with the states and territories. I believe the bill will bring significant advan tages at both the domestic and international levels. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA>The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 forms part of a package of two bills which are being introduced today to make amendments to insurance, banking and superannuation legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>General</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 is an omnibus bill that amends 13 separate acts, and repeals one act. The most significant features of this bill are the provisions that enable the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to adopt `international best practice' in relation to the information sharing provisions of the legislation they administer, thereby improving the prudential supervision of banks, superannuation funds and insurers. The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 also makes a number of technical amendments to insurance <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and banking legislation, some of which I will outline below.</PARA>
<PARA>Enhanced information sharing</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 will liberalise the information sharing provisions of legislation administered by the Reserve Bank and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The amendments will improve protection of bank depositors and insurance policyholders by enabling the Reserve Bank and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to move quickly to exchange information to prevent and/or manage a crisis situation arising in a financial conglomerate in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will enable more effective supervision of conglomerates whose constituent institutions are supervised by different agencies&mdash;for example, bank, life office, public offer superannuation fund operating under a single corporate banner. Currently, around 70 per cent of financial system assets are controlled by the 25 largest conglomerates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rapid exchange of information between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, Reserve Bank of Australia and overseas financial sector supervisory&hyphen;regulatory authorities is a key prudential tool in an increasingly globalised financial sector. The proposed information sharing amendments are consistent with international `best practice' in financial regulation. Both the heads of government of the G7 countries and the Joint Forum on Financial Conglomerates&mdash;an international body comprising representatives of bank, insurance and securities supervisors&mdash;stress the importance of information sharing between supervisors of the various entities that make up transnational financial conglomerates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Administrative arrangements will ensure commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence information is suitably protected by way of agreements with domestic and overseas supervisory&hyphen;regulatory agencies. In line with government policy, some of the provisions relating to information sharing are subject to a five&hyphen;year sunset clause. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7177">
<PARA>Technical amendments to insurance and banking legislation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 also makes a number of amendments to insurance and banking legislation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes amendments to the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Liabilities) Act 1993 to extend by two years the deadline by which foreign bank subsidiaries or money market corporations can apply for, and convert to, branch banking status and qualify for the concessional taxation and other treatment provided for under the act. The amendment is necessary because the government decided that it is not reasonable to expect foreign banks to make long&hyphen;term strategic decisions about whether to convert to branch status whilst the Wallis inquiry into the financial system is in progress, and before its outcomes and changes flowing from it are known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also makes amendments to the Insurance Act 1973 that will improve the supervision of insurance companies through the introduction of a new part IVA into the act that improves the approval process for related body assets. These amendments, which are strongly supported by the industry, enable the prudential controls of the Insurance Act 1973 to be extended to companies related to an insurer where the related company and the insurer seek the approval of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner for such an extension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will enable insurers to include a larger range of investments as assets for the purposes of meeting the solvency test under the Insurance Act 1973, without compromising the integrity of the supervisory regime. This new approval process will operate prospectively so that existing approvals will be unaffected by the new regime. It is expected that the extension of supervisory controls to related body assets will only be used on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis where necessary, and they do not apply to assets in prudentially supervised institutions such as banks, life offices, building societies and credit unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the amendments will enhance the security of insurance policyholder interests by removing certain regulatory decisions from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, AAT. This will prevent insolvent or near insolvent companies from using the AAT appeal process to defer the application of regulatory directions designed to protect the interests of existing policyholders, such as orders to freeze assets or cease trading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This exemption from AAT review is consistent with similar exemptions contained in prudential legislation covering the superannuation sector. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission's regulatory powers in this regard will be checked by the need for the commissioner to obtain ministerial consent for decisions that are non&hyphen;reviewable by the AAT. In addition, exemption from AAT review will be subject to a five&hyphen;year sunset clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 also makes minor adjustments to the balance of the respective interests of consumers and insurers under insurance contracts, removes drafting errors and technical difficulties in existing legislation and provides legislative backing to the industry based code of practice for the general insurance industry, and an industry based code of practice for insurance brokers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also includes a number of technical amendments to existing legislation to make the wording of particular provisions more gender&hyphen;neutral, updates provisions that create offences in line with the current practice and criminal law policy of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, deletes obsolete references to Papua New Guinea, and updates definitions by reference to the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1996 forms part of a package of two bills which are being introduced today to make amendments to insurance, banking and superannuation legislation. This bill will increase the statutory upper limit of the annual supervisory levy paid by Australia's 166 general insurers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statutory upper limit is the maximum level at which the general insurance supervisory levy can be set. It is distinct from the actual levy, which is set by regulation taking into account the actual costs incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission in prudential supervision. The statutory upper limit is indexed in line with the consumer price index.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The levy is designed to recover costs incurred in the prudential supervision of the general insurance industry. The levy is applied uniformly, except for seven small insurers, small cooperatives writing specific cover for their members, who pay a significantly reduced levy&mdash;currently $2,500&mdash;in recognition of the lower costs involved in their supervision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The determination of the actual levy in the past has not reflected full cost recovery; it has been based, to a greater degree, on the direct cost of supervision and has not included the full attribution of overheads. The increase in the statutory upper limit of the levy will enable the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to more fully recover costs incurred in the supervision and prudential regulation of the general insurance industry. Changes in the actual levy are implemented by regulation and can be disallowed by the parliament. I commend the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1996 to the House and present an explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill fulfils the promises made by the coalition in its election policy statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better Pay for Better Work</EMPHASIS> . Before the 1993 election, the Australian Labor Party disguised its policy intentions and, after the election, betrayed the confidences of the Australian people. They legislated the most pro&hyphen;union laws ever introduced into Australia. They did so at the insistence of the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contrast with the coalition's legislation could not be more stark. The pre&hyphen;election guarantee we gave workers was that we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7217"> would keep awards and the Industrial Relations Commission and if you entered an agreement you would not be worse off than under the award. Today we make our guarantee the law and present a balanced system not dictated by some special interest group but a system fair for both employers and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our new act is built on: commitments to a more direct relationship between employers and employees with a much reduced role for third party intervention; a fair go for all so that the system is appropriately balanced and delivers benefits for both employees and employers; genuine freedom of association and greater choice of union representation; a more accessible system; and a stronger sense of the rights and responsibilities of parties in the industrial relations system. The government remains committed to these principles. The bill, as amended, implements them. The task is now for employees and employers to use the opportunities the bill offers them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the legislation we have delivered what we said we would deliver. We have delivered an award system which will provide a safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions with benefits beyond it generally being a matter for agreement at the enterprise or workplace level. We have delivered a system in which there will be more effective flexibility for parties in reaching agreements, a genuine choice of agreements, formal and informal, union and non&hyphen;union, individual and collective. That is, we have put in place enabling legislation&mdash;legislation which is designed purposefully to avoid prescription and to enable employers and employees to find a home in the system which suits their particular needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not favour one agreement stream over another. We do not want to corral employers and employees into one end of the system and boast that as a government we have achieved some remarkable success. We simply want to give them the general flexibility of the jurisdiction established by the legislation so that they can get what they want from the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We have also formally introduced into the federal industrial relations system an individ ual agreement stream. This is a long overdue but profoundly significant change in emphasis in the jurisdiction. Not so long ago this would have seemed an inconceivable proposition at the Commonwealth level. It is an initiative that, for political reasons only, has been resisted by those on the other side of the House and by the trade union movement, but the needs of the modern workplace for simplicity, flexibility and closer direct relations between workers and their employers have won out. It is a new agreement stream which minimises third party intervention. It is designed, subject to a safety net, to get workers into jobs without delay, without conflict between award parties and without costly litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many employers and employees Australian workplace agreements will symbolise that it is now safe to come back into the industrial relations system again. As a new option, Australian workplace agreements will change the character of the federal system. The system is no longer exclusively about registered organisations and collective bargaining; it is now about workers and employers and their particular and local needs. The bill's objects reinforce this, along with other amendments to the certified agreement and award streams which seek to emphasise the views of employers and their employees rather than those of tribunals and third parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also delivered genuine freedom of association founded on effective protection against coercion or discrimination based on an individual's membership or non&hyphen;membership of a union. Mr Speaker, I am delighted to say that today we abolished compulsory unionism. We have also delivered changes which will increase choice and accountability in relation to registered organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In making these changes, we invited registered organisations into the world of competition and improved service delivery for their members. Legislated privilege and monopoly rights have a dwindling relevance to modernity. Employers and employees will always have representational needs, and the bill embraces this concept firmly. But, equally, employers and employees deserve a quality <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7218"> return on the financial and personal trust that they place in organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all their declining membership base, the government has given unions their last best chance to square themselves with workers. The bill is not anti&hyphen;union, despite what some union leaders say. The bill provides unions with a shot at building their status as responsible organisations which provide a professional service geared to the contemporary workplace and the contemporary work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have delivered legislation which will ensure that appropriate standards of industrial conduct are observed. There will be a more effective regime to ensure that agreements are honoured. The commission's powers to curtail unlawful industrial action have been strengthened and secondary boycott provisions have been restored. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have recognised the right to take industrial action. We have also ensured that both parties in the industrial system have proper regard for their responsibilities to one another and the wider community. We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round and, in doing so, we have expressed an overwhelming community consensus that the previous Brereton system did nothing more than stifle employment growth and create division in the workplace. This was Labor's legacy, and the government has buried it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this government, harmonisation of federal and state systems of industrial relations is being pursued through complementary legislation and through a cooperative approach to administrative arrangements and service delivery. Again, the government is conscious of the need to gear industrial relations systems at all levels to the needs of the users. Industrial relations systems should not be characterised by institutionalisation of bureaucracy and undue process. Consistent with the forces affecting all areas of government at all levels, the system as a whole should be about delivering services to its users, ensuring their ease of access and providing quick and effective responses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This approach has affected many aspects of the bill, and it is an important force for future change. But it has had a more recent impact <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as well. This week the Victorian government moved legislatively to refer its powers over industrial relations to the Commonwealth. This sends a powerful message about the leadership of the Victorian government. It does, too, provide a vote of confidence in this government's vision of the workplace as embedded in this legislation. It is also an eminently practical decision which will ensure that businesses in Victoria will be able to consolidate their industrial relations strategies under the federal system and boost their efficiency as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small and medium&hyphen;sized businesses will be able to use federal arrangements for Australian workplace agreements or for collective agreements without the need for an award if that is their wish, and without the need to become embroiled in the jurisdictional and constitutional complexities which have dogged their quest for flexibility and productivity. This symbolises the capacity of governments to make real and substantial improvements in the way in which users interface with the industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the bill provides that employees and employers should have the right to choose whether they wish to be covered by an award or agreement in the state or the federal jurisdiction. The amendments to the provisions dealing with federal&hyphen;state coverage maintain this principle. They continue to allow choice between federal awards and state employment agreements provided that the relevant state legislation contains certain protections for employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In opening new options in the agreement stream in the changes to the role of organisations under the bill, in the harmonisation initiatives being undertaken by the government, in wearing down the borders between state and Commonwealth industrial relations jurisdictions, the government is demonstrating that the wider system can genuinely work for the benefit of its users&mdash;that is, that this industrial relations system can and should work in the context of modern standards of service delivery and best practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also believes that the workplace relations system which its legislation establishes is appropriately balanced and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7219"> delivers benefits for both employers and employees. We have had lengthy discussions with the Australian Democrats about the concerns they had in relation to some of the arrangements proposed by the government in its original bill. In these discussions there was a common respect for principle and a common commitment to making the legislation work for all Australians. I congratulate the Democrats on the cooperative and positive approach that they brought to this task, and thank them for the manner in which our discussions and negotiations were conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to rebut the misrepresentation that the government's industrial relations policy is a low wage policy. The aim of the reforms is not to cut wages and conditions, but to promote higher productivity and a more flexible labour market and so provide the opportunity for higher wages and better conditions for workers. This, after all, was where the government staked its ground in its election policy statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better Pay for Better Work</EMPHASIS>, which was so resoundingly affirmed by the Australian people on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pressing need for genuine labour market reform to which this bill gives strong support is highlighted by Australia's dismal productivity performance over the last decade and a half. According to the OECD, between 1979 and 1995 Australia's annual rate of growth in labour productivity averaged a meagre 1.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was below the OECD average and far behind rates of productivity growth recorded in some of the dynamic economies to our north. These years of dismal productivity growth largely coincided with the era of centralised wage fixation. The pick&hyphen;up in our productivity performance to the extent that we have had it in recent years with the introduction of enterprise bargaining, even on Labor's flawed model, goes to show the enormous potential gains which will flow from a genuine program of labour market reform such as ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Only through genuine reform can we secure the productivity improvement that is necessary to underpin continued employment growth and a sustainable rise in living stand ards for all Australians. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> In view of this, the award system will operate as a safety net of minimum wages and conditions. The detailed mechanism for its adjustment is being left within the jurisdiction of the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of factors which the commission will be required to have regard to when it is adjusting the safety net. These include a range of economic considerations: productivity, inflation and unemployment. It will have to consider the needs of the low paid, equal pay and the need to prevent discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will also need to ensure that any alterations to wage relativities between awards are based on skill, responsibility and the conditions under which work is performed. This requirement recognises the importance of relativities between awards for the viability of the award wage system in ensuring its capacity both to maintain the stability and equity of the system and to provide ongoing net protection. The government's legislation does not extend, however, to internal relativities within awards. Indeed, the emphasis which we are proposing, and in particular the focus on the low paid and minimum safety net, may involve some compression of internal relativities. Such compression has occurred in the past when the commission has awarded flat dollar increases in award rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, while stable relativities between awards are important for the workability of the system and for their safety net role, the government anticipates that, over time, there will be increasing diversity in actual pay relationships as a result of the emphasis of the system on agreement making. Wages and conditions need to increasingly reflect local needs and circumstances. Similarly, in future, when maintaining the safety net, regard must be had by the commission when altering wage relativities between awards to the skill, responsibility and the conditions under which work is performed. That is, the bill consigns to the deeper past still the notions of automatic wage flow&hyphen;on between awards and comparative wage justice.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7220">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The focusing of the award system on the provision of minimum terms and conditions of employment will apply to all awards, regardless of their customary status as either minimum rates or paid rates. All awards will be simplified. The same allowable matters and the same process and timing will apply. There will not be new paid rates awards. Over time, and following consultation between the parties, it is expected that existing paid rates structures will be phased out and translated into minimum rates arrangements under the supervision of the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Transitional provisions in the bill work to ensure that overall pay entitlements are not reduced as part of such conversion process. Wages and conditions beyond the minimum safety net will be a matter for the parties themselves to settle through enterprise and workplace agreements. In exceptional circumstances, there is provision for special case arbitration in certain critical dispute situations and in situations where paid rates awards have customarily applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this is only where all efforts to reach an agreement have been exhausted and the exceptional nature of any fixed term arbitration undertaken in these circumstances is reflected in the conditions that apply, including consideration by a full bench of the public interest, how productivity might be improved and the conduct of the negotiating parties. In addition, any resultant award will not generally be able to be varied or to form part of the benchmark for the no disadvantage test for any subsequent bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Strong incentives are maintained in the workplace relations framework generally to focus the system on agreement making rather than recourse to the commission. Even then, conciliation must be exhausted so that any arbitration other than general adjustments to the safety net will be a last resort confined to special and isolated cases. The expectation is that most parties who have been on paid rates awards will be covered by agreements. This is not new, as employees covered by paid rates awards have generally made the transition to enterprise bargaining so that their actual terms and conditions are now determined by agreements, rather than awards.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments to the bill also provide that award minima will act as the benchmark for the tests which are to apply to formalised agreements. In order to be formalised, all agreements will now be required to satisfy a modified version of the existing no disadvantage test. In the light of the move to the vetting of AWAs provided for in the amendments agreed with the Democrats and against the background of the award simplification process, the government believes that the new no disadvantage test provides a practical way of delivering the government's commitments while affording considerable flexibility to the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, the legislation makes it clear that the no disadvantage test is a global one. That is, the test is whether an agreement would result in a reduction in the overall terms and conditions of employees to be covered. The government's intention is that, apart from this overall assessment, flexibility not be constrained. Subject only to the global test, employers and employees are now at liberty to strike genuinely innovative agreements without any contrivances or artificial restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be up to the Employment Advocate or the commission to weigh up the respective elements of the different components of a proposed agreement in deciding whether there was any disadvantage to employees in their overall terms and conditions of employment. Different sorts of considerations might be relevant in different contexts. As such, any term or condition of employment may be negotiated and dealt with by agreement, provided it is consistent with the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's approach to the reform of workplace relations in Australia retains an important role for the commission, whose status and involvement will continue to be integral to the effective working of our system of workplace relations. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The commission's role will be different in a number of important respects under the new legislation as employers and employees increasingly take responsibility for their own industrial relations and agreement <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7221"> making and awards become a safety net of minimum wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will have a particular role in ensuring the establishment and maintenance of the award safety net, encouraging the making of certified agreements, overseeing the conduct of workplace bargaining for certified agreements and ensuring that the parties to such agreements and awards comply with their industrial responsibilities and obligations. It will have responsibility for managing the simplification for the award safety net and for encouraging the spread of and improved access to part&hyphen;time work with pro rata conditions and reasonable predictability of working hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the bill do broaden the commission's role in several respects, but we have focused the commission's role, particularly and importantly for the benefit of the low paid. The government's submission to the commission, foreshadowed last weekend by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), is yet again evidence of our concern for the low paid, both in respect of the wages which they receive and their prospects of both retaining the jobs they have and for the unemployed securing a job in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the commission has a role in intervening beyond the minimum safety net of allowable award matters, the legislation ensures that this is appropriately circumscribed so that the focus of the system on agreement making at the enterprise and workplace levels is maintained. There are a number of criteria that will have to be met before the commission can make such orders. These are intended to ensure that the jurisdiction is confined to exceptional matters and that there is no reasonable prospect of their being settled by agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exceptional matters orders include a requirement that they relate to a single matter and apply to only a single business unless the commission is satisfied that an application is appropriate. Such acceptable matters provisions cannot undermine the award simplification process, or the strong emphasis of the legislation on the role of awards as setting minimum wages and conditions overall, while actual wage determination is principally <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> managed through formal or informal agreements made at the workplace level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have often referred to the consultative process which began before the election last March and has led to the legislation which will be concluded today. It was a process which included employers, employer organisations, unions, the ACTU, governments&mdash;state and territory&mdash;women's organisations and churches, and ethnic community and welfare groups. We have benefited considerably from their comments and suggestions&mdash;we have taken many on board&mdash;and the government is grateful for their effort and involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, some individual organisations and people who took part in that process do stand out in terms of the depth, consistency and strength of their ongoing contribution to the development of the bill. It is appropriate today that their names go on the record. In particular, I wish to acknowledge the contributions of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Bryan Noakes and Reg Hamilton provided very constructive and important support throughout the process. The ACTU were very involved through the committee on industrial legislation. I particularly acknowledge the work done by Tim Pallas and John Cairns in that respect. Our thanks go to the Metal Trades Industry Association, the Australian Retailers Association, the National Farmers Federation and the Labour Council of New South Wales, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Brendan Macarthy, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Michael Angwin, Professor Charles Mulvey, Paul Houlihan and Dr Chris Jessup QC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also grateful to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for continuing to provide us with consistently high quality legislative drafting against very short deadlines. I also thank the Department of Industrial Relations, which has throughout the process demonstrated its professionalism, capacity for authoritative technical advice and openness to innovative approaches to policy and institutional reforms and for, above all, its singular ability to provide a quality service to the government of the day.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7222">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also particularly want to acknowledge the work done by my ministerial staff in the process prior to the election and throughout a very long eight months. To Peter Richards, my chief of staff; to Jonathan Hamberger, who worked for me once before as an adviser on industrial relations and who is a specialist par excellence in this field, and to Nick Hordern, who worked with me both as a policy adviser and as a media adviser all through the process&mdash;my special and grateful thanks. Thanks also go to my other ministerial staff who provided great support and worked many hours to see the successful conclusion of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The task for the reformist is not over. The policy debate must go on. For business and for employers and employees the pressing task is to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the new laws. The government, in its role as an employer, needs to address its own human resources strategy. We also need to encourage better practices in key industries like the waterfront, construction and meat processing industries and other industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I place on record my thanks to the Prime Minister and to my colleagues for the support that they have given me in this process. Lastly, I thank the Australian people for the confidence with which they trusted us to present this bill and to see its successful carriage today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.18 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commence in the tone that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) concluded&mdash;it might be the only thing about which we agree&mdash;and to thank some people for their contribution to the debate which led to us dealing with these amendments today. I particularly thank Senator Sherry and the Labor senators for their excellent and diligent work throughout a very complex process of dealing with these and many other amendments which were not successful in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the clerks in the House and the Senate for their great assistance to the opposition in a very complex task of drafting, which they did very effectively and conscientiously. On behalf of all my Labor colleagues here and in the Senate, I thank David Fredericks <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for the work he did in assisting us in the drafting of these amendments and in the processing and management of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition recognises what is, for it, an unpleasant political reality that these amendments mean that this flawed and unfair bill has been passed by the Senate with many of its worst features intact and its original criticisms still valid. Our original criticisms were very lengthy. I made a half&hyphen;hour speech, we moved 300 amendments and many of our colleagues spoke, so I will not repeat all that. But our concerns came down to three core principles. Our concerns were that this bill undermined the Industrial Relations Commission, it undermined the award system and it undermined the rights of workers to organise. All these three concerns continue, slightly modified in some instances. But, even after these amendments, those concerns are still valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industrial Relations Commission, for example, has lost its general jurisdiction to arbitrate to settle industrial disputes. The significance of that change to industrial relations in Australia and many aspects of our economy and society in future is a remarkable thing which I think most Australians are not aware of. That has gone, despite the assurance of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that the Industrial Relations Commission would keep its powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For every worker working in Australia now, the award system, which has underpinned and been the vehicle for advancement of workers' wages and conditions for generations, has played some, if not the total, role in determining wages and working conditions. They are now stripped back as a result of these amendments to 20 allowable matters rather than merely 18&mdash;but the balance still disappears in 18 months. The clock has started ticking for so many fundamental award conditions for Australian workers, despite the Prime Minister's guarantee that no worker would lose their award conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right to organise is still at risk, most particularly due to, simply summarised, the massive increases in penalties and punishments and the easier access to these sanctions rather than the use of the conciliation and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7223"> arbitration process to which Australians have become accustomed and which has been part of the cooperative process leading to, in recent years, a record low level of industrial disputes. This is, unfortunately, already showing signs of increasing under the industrial relations management of this government, even before we run into the problems that this bill might generate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the strongest and the best organised workers will win their lost conditions back. Some already have a guarantee to that effect. But for others&mdash;those who need the award protections most, those who need the Industrial Relations Commission most, those who need the support of the collective organisations that represent them most&mdash;these provisions will be gone forever. Many workers, many workplaces, will be back to 20 basic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Think of the circumstances in which the workers find themselves when trying to negotiate to win these conditions back. The person with whom they are negotiating knows that if no agreement is reached the conditions disappear. There is no imperative on the employer to agree at all. Many reasonable employers will. But the point of it is that the fundamental protections that these awards provide are against the activities of unreasonable employers, and they are the ones who are empowered by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much for the rock solid guarantee that no worker would be worse off. Not that that should be a surprise, of course, because we have already established quite clearly that under the government's submission to the Industrial Relations Commission, to which the minister referred in his speech, low paid workers will be $1,000 a year worse off than they would have been under the proposals of the previous Labor government. So much for the fact that no worker would be worse off. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does that leave us after the passage of the workplace relations bill? It still leaves us with a fundamentally flawed bill. It still leaves us with an unfair bill. It still leaves us with a bill that undermines the three pillars of Australian industrial relations which have protected Australian workers. It leaves us with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Prime Minister's promises to workers during the election campaign lying in a crumpled heap, just next to those from the budget and the other broken promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking forward, where do we go to from here? Strenuous as our opposition to this bill continues to be, it will become the law quite soon. Despite our continuing opposition, that will occur. How are we to look forward to measure the success or failure of this bill? We have found people running away very hard from the idea of what criteria should be set to measure the success of this bill. We have had a few comments about what should not be used. Let me make some suggestions of criteria, apart from the Prime Minister's two promises that no worker would be worse off and no worker would lose their award conditions. What are other broader social and economic criteria?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will there be fewer industrial disputes over this three&hyphen;year term under this regime than there were in the last three years under the old regime? Each time I raise this, the media likes to interpret it as some sort of forecast of industrial war. I am not predicting industrial Armageddon. The signs at the moment are not encouraging about what is going to happen in terms of the number of industrial disputes in Australia, but there is still time&mdash;even under this bill&mdash;for the government to adopt a cooperative approach that would not lead to a major increase in industrial disputes. The signs are not very optimistic, either about the current trends or about this bill, but let us wait and see and measure this bill against that criterion first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps more importantly, will there be more jobs created in this parliamentary term under this regime than there were in the last term of the parliament? Particularly, will there be more jobs created in small business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the social criterion of fairness, will the distribution of wage outcomes and benefits be fairer after this bill than it was before it? Will the gap between high and low incomes narrow or widen? Will the gap between male and female incomes narrow or widen? The sign are not good, but let us see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7224"> We have had great emphasis on how this will boost productivity. Will labour produc tivity increase faster after this bill than the current trend rate of 1.75 per cent per annum? I think that is unlikely, but let us see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the broader economic objectives with regard to continuing growth, will the overall wage outcomes be more consistent with the low inflation, low interest rate environment than the outcomes under the present system? It may be that over time other criteria will be set. But it seems to me that is not a bad starting point against which to measure the success of this proposed new industrial relations regime. At least these criteria of success look for positive outcomes. I note that the minister has recently raised some criteria that are essentially negative&mdash;criteria that he will not use. For example, he said he would not be measuring the success of the legislation by simply counting the number of employees covered by AWAs. That is a bit of an irony, because we remember the same person constantly saying that enterprise flexibility agreements were clearly a failure because they had not been used in any significant numbers. It is interesting to ask why the minister is retreating from applying the same standard to his new Australian workplace agreement stream, and we will look to see how many people take up these proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also asked the minister previously in the parliament to give us an assurance, because of the great job benefits he sees in this bill, that the government will create more than 500,000 jobs in small business in this term. He has not yet given that assurance. We continue to seek it. We will monitor with interest the outcomes in that regard. I think it is highly unlikely that it is a goal that can be achieved; nevertheless, it is a very significant criterion for every Australian family, for every Australian unemployed worker, for all those in employment who are concerned about their employment security. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The principle concern is, at its core, even after these inadequate, unsatisfactory amendments, this is a bill which fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the labour market. It continues to be predicated on the assumption of equality of bargaining power in the workplace between employers and em ployees. That assumption is so fundamentally flawed&mdash;so obviously flawed to anyone who has been on a workplace floor for more than five minutes, or spoken to workers rather than spoken at them, who has listened to workers&mdash;that it is hard to believe that you could build an edifice on such a flawed structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the fundamental flaws of that structure that permeate every element of this bill. It is what inevitably means, however one measures the intentions of those who initiated the bill or those who negotiated the amendments, that the outcome of this process must be fundamentally flawed and can be only an unfair outcome because of the absolute failure to recognise that aspect of the labour market and the need for elements of this legislation to cope with the consequences of that fundamental difference in bargaining power in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is those problems and that circumstance that pervades this bill and means that it has the regressive social consequences about which we are so apprehensive without having the capacity to deliver the economic benefits which the government seeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, looking prospectively, going beyond the immediate concerns, this bill absolutely fails to address, and by its inactivity will exacerbate, the biggest issue in workplaces today. It is none of the things the minister has spoken about. When you go into workplaces and talk to workers, when you look at the surveys that the Department of Industrial Relations itself does&mdash;and I suspect when you look at the market research the Liberal Party does&mdash;the biggest issue for Australian workers today is the increased stress and insecurity in their workplaces. Workers say they are having to work harder, having to work longer and are feeling less secure because circumstances continue to change under their feet every day. They find themselves negotiating away conditions that they value to preserve living standards that they need. They feel that they cannot see in the future the security to which they have aspired. There is a significant emergence of bargaining fatigue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even those who have done very well under enterprise bargaining&mdash;and that is not all&mdash;are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7225"> flagging under the pressure of being called upon to do it again and again. Under this bill, they are called upon to enter into an extra round of enterprise bargaining merely to win back conditions that are currently guaranteed to them under their award. I can assure the House&mdash;particularly the government members&mdash;that I have not found a worker who is looking forward to a round of enterprise bargaining to win back their award conditions that the government has arbitrarily taken away from them by this legislation. The Democrats have conspired in having taken those away from them, with only the most meagre&mdash;but welcome&mdash;modifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill fails to address the most profound issue affecting workers in their workplaces today&mdash;the issue of stress and insecurity. By its inadvertence and by its increased emphasis on the nature of the negotiations at the workplace, the increased need for enterprise bargaining and workplace bargaining, that insecurity and that stress will be increased. All the evidence from Victoria and Western Australia, where there has been increased emphasis in this way on individual contracts and on the nature of bargaining fundamentally underpinning Australian workplace agreements, has been that the stress, the insecurity, the pressure and the working hours for workers under those agreements have gone up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to the third point about the future. This bill fundamentally ignores the emerging issue of working hours and the fair distribution of work in our society. With the changes being made, we are finding that working hours for those in work are going up while more and more Australians are either seeking work or seeking increased hours of work. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> As with the minister, I will make sure this is my last extension. I thank the House for its agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we are debating the amendments that the government has moved and the bill as a consequence, I might continue to talk about that. It might cause you concern but I might do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very serious issue emerging which all governments should be addressing and which people with social concern need to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> give consideration to and which the Labor Party in opposition will be developing policies about as a response and to put to the people. It is this issue of the fair distribution of work, the fact that those in work are working longer hours while more and more Australians are either seeking work or seeking more hours of work. It is a profound issue, it is an important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this bill does nothing about it, all the trends measured in the response to individual workplace agreements of the type reflected in this legislation lead to increased working hours. The Western Australian experience makes that clear. The Victorian experience makes that clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An objective observer would need to accept that the political management of the process of negotiation with the Democrats has been adroit. It is not necessarily a political plus for the government in the long term. Any objective observer would say it has been a political plus for the Minister for Industrial Relations inside the government, particularly in his competition with the Treasurer (Mr Costello). You would have to say there is one achievement out of these amendments. They have enhanced the relative status of the Minister for Industrial Relations vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis the Treasurer and anything that sets back the Treasurer's political career has to have something going for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, you can see the advantage to Mr Reith within the Liberal Party. It might have been smart politics but it is very bad industrial relations. That, I remind the minister, is actually his job. I know his principle preoccupation is his position within the government but his job is to improve industrial relations in Australia and with this bill, even after these amendments which do marginally improve the bill that went through the House, he still failed to deliver on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7226"> I look forward to the opportunity, having reluctantly to accept the reality that this will become the law in this country, to reviewing its progress against the five benchmarks I have set down and the Prime Minister's two promises&mdash;the rock solid guarantee. You would have thought a rock solid guarantee might have been a core promise but, obvious ly, it was a non&hyphen;core promise. You would have thought the commitment that no worker would lose their award conditions might have been a core promise but, obviously, it was a non&hyphen;core promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not support accepting these amendments. While we recognise that they make the bill better than that which passed the House of Representatives, they do not go anywhere near far enough to improve this bill to make it an acceptable package for us. They leave us with a bill that is socially regressive, industrially disruptive and economically irrelevant. For those reasons, we will not be supporting the motion to accept these amendments and my colleagues will be seeking to support me in expressing the depth of our opposition to the bill which is emerging as a result of the Senate's amendments.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA>So there is the evidence proof positive that they have virtually doubled the number of divisions this year. Going back to the figures which are inclusive to 1987, the opposition parties are now the all-time record holders. They are the all-time callers of divisions. They hold the all-time record. They hold the record for the sittings at which five or more divisions occurred over that period. They are nudging the record of sittings at which at least one division occurred as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the number of divisions, those opposite have already got the record&mdash;that is, 177 as at the printing of this report. I will not say any more. I have taken only two or three minutes to make the point. Quite frankly, it is absolutely ridiculous that the opposition's tactics are simply denying its own people the opportunity to speak. We were quite happy, and as evidence we have set this for 11.15. We would have been happy to agree with you, which would have obviated the necessity for divisions. But, simply because you want to parade yourself as a potential leader&mdash;how aggressive you are in opposition and what a great job you are doing as Manager of Opposition Business&mdash;for these infantile reasons, we are about to have a strong and forceful speech from the Manager of Opposition <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7227"> Business, who will announce to the world that democracy today has been trampled upon, that freedom of speech has been limited and that the government has been totally unreasonable.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is indeed an historic occasion. It has been some 10 years, perhaps 12 altogether, since the initial divide in the industrial relations debate in this country. Members will recall that, for decade after decade, largely both sides of politics supported the centralised command driven model of industrial relations. Both sides of politics supported national wage cases. Both sides of politics supported a system where employers and employees were kept apart from each other in negotiations about their conditions of employment and indeed about their wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was in 1984 that my side of politics finally started to set a divide in the political debate in Australia. In setting that divide, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7228"> increasingly, my side of politics has seen a need to move to a more modern and open system, to devolve industrial relations back to the parties where it really matters&mdash;that is, the parties at the individual work circumstance that happens to exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill we are discussing today goes a long way towards achieving that objective. It is another step in the train of devolution of responsibility from central arbitral bodies back to the central players, the real players&mdash;that is, the work force and the management in all the businesses around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I noticed today as I looked at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> is that it is 21 November 1996. I recall that it was on 21 April 1993 that the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, went to an Institute of Company Directors meeting in Melbourne and made two basic propositions. He said, firstly, that the award system was too complex, that it was too full of minutiae and that the awards ought to be simplified. He said that the awards should be brought down to basic core conditions as a safety net for conditions of employment in Australia. He did not say anything about having a single national minimum wage, like the United States. What he said was that awards should be simplified and brought back to core conditions. I have to say that this legislation now accomplishes what the then Prime Minister on 21 April 1993 said should happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major point that Paul Keating made in that address to the Institute of Company Directors was that, where workplaces were largely non-unionised&mdash;and I have to say that is the bulk of workplaces in our country; certainly 75 per cent, and perhaps more, of the private sector workplaces in Australia are non-unionised&mdash;there should be an opportunity for those employees and their employers to negotiate agreements outside the formalised industrial relations system, leaving aside the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and leaving aside the formal arbitral process. But he also said that there should be some minimum standard set of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conditions described by the award to underpin that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Literally, this legislation brings to fruition what the then Prime Minister, the then leader of the Labor Party&mdash;the party which now sits in opposition&mdash;wanted to accomplish. It seems to me an unbelievable dichotomy that the Labor Party sits there and argues hour after hour, point after point, against these basic propositions that its then leader, its Prime Minister, proposed to the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall that the present member for Kingsford-Smith, Laurie Brereton, wanted to implement what Paul Keating said should happen but Laurie Brereton was prevented by the union leaders from continuing down that path. We have picked up the option based on our policy differential, which we started in 1984 and which has continued since that day, to try to change the system, to make a more cooperative workplace culture, to make Australia more productive, to make our industry more efficient and to make more jobs for Australians. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly this morning on a matter which I think has received far too little attention from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and indeed from the Democrats. I was most disappointed to see the Democrats in the Senate agreeing to conditions which will see the position of women in our society deteriorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the minister blusters about this, because it is a point of great sensitivity, but there is now an enormous amount of evidence showing that women under many circumstances, even of enterprise bargaining, are the losers. They lose wages and they lose flexibility and hours. It is a matter that requires very considerable attention from the community because what is proposed in this legislation, and what will now be enacted, is a set of circumstances which makes the difficulties that women already face pale into insignificance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is fond of talking about their valuing of families. They have made much of the fact that in their view this legislation assists those people, mainly women, who have dual responsibilities&mdash;that is, not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7229"> only in the workplace but at home. They talk about family friendly arrangements, but the evidence to date suggests that the opposite is occurring in this country and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In New Zealand, for example, it is very clear that under these workplace agreements, which resemble what has been agreed with the Democrats here, women are the ones most likely to trade off hours, which makes it more difficult for them to meet family responsibilities. Unlike men in that community, it was found that women do not get any increased wage, so they are actually losing the flexibility and losing the hours.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of concerns about the trends that were evident in New Zealand and concerns amongst women here on our side of politics&mdash;including our minister of the day&mdash;that there might be some deterioration in women's positions under enterprise bargaining, and certainly under workplace agreements, a flexible working hours and women's project was undertaken under the Sex Discrimination Act. The work that was done there shows very clearly what has been shown elsewhere. In investigating the range of changes made to working time arrangements in enterprise agreements, the effects on women's lives of demands for increasing flexibility and hours were very clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women even now have been trading off hours and conditions in a way that is not true of men. That has a lot to do with the way women's work is constructed. They are more likely to be in non-unionised areas of work, they are more likely to work in isolation and they are less likely to have the protection of awards. In other words, they are already subject to the winds that you would now have blow over the entire Australian community. They find it very difficult in many cases to negotiate and to get the sorts of improvements that are supposed to flow from these individual agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, in Western Australia, where you have had workplace agreements now for some time, there has been some improvement in men's wages: they have traded them off against hours and other flexibility. But, in the case of women, they have traded off the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hours, they have reduced flexibility and there is more shift work and weekend work&mdash;without increases in pay. Women's wages in Western Australia are now well below the national average whereas men's wages are above it. In other words, the dispersion and the difference are growing under the sort of system that has now been embraced by the government and, I must say to my great disappointment, by the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats would have us believe that they are very sympathetic to women in our community. They make much of the fact that theirs is a largely female party, both in its representation and in its membership. Yet they have, by negotiation with the government, clearly delivered to the women of Australia a significant deterioration in working conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very clear that not only the work undertaken under the flexible working hours and women's project but also the 1995 report of the Industrial Relations Commission on enterprise bargaining, which was recently released after a long delay, show a large amount of information that confirms what I have been saying. Unfortunately, this report will now come out once every two years&mdash;that is a compromise, I suppose&mdash;instead of the three years that was proposed. What you see in these agreements is that women's hours of work are discussed&mdash;some 65 per cent of agreements and 74 per cent of private agreements in particular. And what are they doing? They are trading off flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you ask women what they want in the workplace they say that they would prefer predictability: they would prefer to work Monday to Friday, nine to five. Yet what is happening here is that they are being forced to work less predictable hours in areas where they are asked to work increasing hours, and they are not getting the wage increases right now.

You went out there and ran your fear campaign&mdash;everyone would be working for $3 a day&mdash;and the people out there rejected you, because they saw that it was absolutely necessary for their convenience, for their interests and for the future of their children that our labour arrangements in Australia change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You heard President Clinton here yesterday. He came to us with a simple message: Australia is no island, and Australia cannot operate in the international labour markets by giving pay increases just because we want them. Whether we like it or not, that is stealing from our children. You kid yourselves that you can legislate wage increases when in fact the marketplace says, `We'll pick up our capital goods. We'll go to another country.' You will leave the children of this great  nation with nowhere to go. That is what you are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You stand up here and talk about wages in other countries, and I know that they are extremely low. I also know that those people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are extremely unproductive. It would take a lot for those on $3 a day to deliver the same outcome that some Australian worker will deliver on twelve bucks an hour. That is the reality. We can be competitive. But, unless that $12 has a direct relationship to productivity, nobody in Australia will be able to afford to pay it, because nobody will buy their goods at the end cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are past that point. If you read the papers today, there is our party trying to be a little more conservative on our international trade dealings in terms of protection, and the academics are out saying, `Don't. Go for it.' You people did a wonderful thing for the working class. You are the ones&mdash;first under Whitlam, then under Keating&mdash;who chopped the hell out of protection and then told Australian employers to stick with the regulated labour market. What did they do? They said, `Thank very much, we're leaving.' Unfortunately, you didn't have the law to nail their feet to the antiquated work practices and workshops&mdash;that is what you didn't have&mdash;and they left. Pick up your shirt. What has it got written on the back? `Speedo. Made in China.' A great Australian name. That is what you have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this legislation is to re-establish the rights of Australian working people to be well paid for good work. If we do not do it, the world is going to laugh us out of existence. You can go on living in fairyland but, if you have some commitment to the children, any wage increase that is not tied to productivity is like your $80 billion of borrowing: it is stealing from your kids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If workers get wage increases that cannot be justified by productivity, they are just further disadvantaging their own children&mdash;and I think a very large number of the workers now know it. That is why the people in Lindsay told you to go bowl your hoop. If you do not wake up to that and to a few of the other fundamental issues, the present 40 members are going to be 20&mdash;we will not mind that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, the reality is that since the 1980s every pay rise that a worker has obtained has been based on productivity. Indeed, a lot of the blue&hyphen;collar assault on the Labor Party was their perception that every time they wanted a wage increase they had to sweat blood for it. The $8 pay increase that the government are talking about flowing on to some classes of wage earners would go to areas where the workers have not been able to achieve pay rises, mainly because the recessed state of the industry has not enabled them to bargain in the context of productivity improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, by and large, in those industries that have been substantially non-unionised where productivity improvements have not occurred. In all other sectors a pay rise has to be based on specific productivity increases. I have been involved in countless numbers of cases where it has been very difficult to convince the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that the required percentage of productivity improvements have occurred. It is quite wrong to say that wage rates today do not reflect productivity increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The other area I want to focus on is the misnomer to suggest&mdash;as has been suggested in answer to questions&mdash;that unemployment will be solved because of stricter and tighter unfair dismissal provisions contained in the legislation. That just will not occur. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reality is that, as the annual report of the Industrial Relations Court indicates, fewer than two per cent of involuntary terminations come before the court as unfair dismissal cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the impact that that safety net has&mdash;and this is a real safety net because it enables workers who have been unfairly dismissed to preserve not only their own interests but also those of their family&mdash;30 per cent of those unfairly dismissed and who have brought cases are over the age of 40. We know how increasingly difficult it is for them to obtain employment. Of the unfair dismissals, 42 per cent come from those whose wages fall between $20,000 and $35,000 a year. This is the classic battler wage group. They are going to be disadvantaged by not having access to the provisions. Also, 56 per cent of those workers are without post-school qualifications. The unfair dismissal provisions have been the actual safety net for the battlers, for those who have been downtrodden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony of this bill is that the tighter restrictions will probably mean that the unionised work force will have better unfair dismissal provisions because they will be able to rely on the general industrial dispute provisions, as has been demonstrated in the Vista Paper Products case, the Ranger Uranium case and the Boyne Smelter case. Where workplaces are unionised, they will be able to create industrial disputes&mdash;albeit they will have to escalate that to the stage of a `critical dispute' under these provisions. But, ironically, it is those unionised work forces that will have access to better unfair dismissal provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the poor old non&hyphen;unionised battler&mdash;to use the now cliched expression of the government&mdash;who will really be prejudiced by the removal of the unfair dismissal provisions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to participate in this very historic debate here today, even though it is only for a short while. However, it goes back to 1986 when the minister at the table, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), the Hon. Neil Brown and I developed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7232"> the embryo of the current industrial relations policy. I also acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith). He also participated in those early debates to develop a freer and more flexible industrial relations system. It is 10 years almost to the day that those original and very thoughtful ideas were put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also pay tribute to the minister at the table for his contribution during that 10-year period when we argued with the then government. The proof of the success of our particular propositions in opposition is that the Labor government agreed with a more flexible enterprise agreement but, unfortunately, they could not get away from the shackles of the union movement. I also put on the public record the excellent work that the minister at the table did during the election campaign, where the Labor government did everything in their power to misrepresent what the opposition at that time were proposing. The minister got through the campaign, faithfully put our proposition and then has converted that to a legislative program that is here before the House on this very historic occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see the situation where the enterprise agreements are now true enterprise agreements between the employer and the employee under the normal contractual arrangement, not by a third party, the Industrial Relations Commission, interfering with that sensitive and personal relationship between management and the work force. The minister has done an outstanding job in preparing the detailed schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also put on the record the cooperation of the Australian Democrats in allowing the government to get a main plank of their election platform through the Senate. It has now returned to the House on this very historic occasion. We see the situation where the unfair dismissals law has been chucked out. Most members on the other side of the parliament would understand what a good thing that is. They understood it was not working and was causing them considerable difficulty. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Employment Advocate will make sure that those employees who want some assistance can get it. They will be able to use the services of the Employment Advocate to ensure that any agreement they reach with their employer is correct and reflects their aspirations in the workplace, and make sure that any employer does not victimise employees, as has been the allegation of the opposition at this stage. The 45D secondary boycott provision is another aspect that was removed by the Labor government in the hope that the industrial thuggery of the union movement could be used from time to time.</PARA>

I had a particular case in the electorate of Robertson when the wool scourers were stood over by the union movement because of a demarcation dispute. This was an indictment of the union movement and industrial relations in Australia in the 1990s. That was an example we had in the last six months. It is no good the member for Cunningham suggesting that was not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying this is a very historic occasion for this parliament. We had the American President here yesterday and today we have the return of these amendments from the Senate. They will be passed by this House and they were passed by the Senate. This industrial relations legislation will be enshrined as a tribute to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who put a great amount of effort into developing the general philosophy, assisted by the minister at the table and a number of us who supported both the Prime Minister and the minister in developing that framework. We have a very good legislative package which reflects that philosophical position. I am sure all workers in Australia and all managements will be much better off. The prosperity that will emanate from this over the next 100 years will ensure that this historic piece of legislation forms an important part of the Howard government&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS> </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no question that the workplace relations act, when it is finally brought into play, will make the work environment much harder for women. The smirk from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) just makes it clear that he knows that, too. It is going to mean the expansion of individual contracts which will make things a lot harder for people in very disadvantaged positions. What it is going to mean is increased difficulty in accessing federal awards, despite our Victorian Premier's much publicised handover of his industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation actually makes it much harder for workers in the private sector to access federal awards. I would say that this is particularly the case for women workers employed in small business, the place where this government thinks this legislation is going to have such a great impact. It certainly will not have a great impact on the conditions of women working in those places where there is no award protection. For hairdressers and waitresses, and in all those places where women are working, there is going to be much less emphasis on award protection generally. Of course, in those places where we already have poor award protection it is only going to get a lot worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole point of an award and safety net structure is to protect the vulnerable. We have heard a lot about that from the government talking about protecting the vulnerable. What this legislation does to the vulnerable is make their protection a lot less widespread. It is going to make the protection for women much more difficult. It is obviously going to reduce their safety net protection. We are going to have a lot more of the most vulnerable people hurt as a result of this legislation because it makes accessing award structures a lot more difficult. The safety net structures that previously existed for the low paid and semi&hyphen;skilled workers have been their only protection. That is going to be a lot worse now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing the continuing restructure of work and, as a result of this legislation, there will be more of an increase in the numbers of people working casually and part time. I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would argue that this legislation simply lays the groundwork for increased exploitation of these workers. What this government says is that it wants to increase the level of flexibility for part&hyphen;time workers, something that for many women is very important. But what is going to happen as a result of this legislation is that flexibility will be entirely employer driven. It will be up to the employer to say when he or she wants the women to come to work on a part&hyphen;time basis. How is that going to fit in with women's child&hyphen;care responsibilities? Those people are going to find themselves with increased child&hyphen;care costs, both as the result of this government's changes to child care and as a result of the reductions in capacity to pay that will come about because of the exploitation of low paid women. It will make the position of women considerably worse. It is something that we will continue to campaign against.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet)  to the Prime Minister) (11.27 a.m.)&mdash;I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill will give legislative effect to an agreement entered into by the Commonwealth government with the state of Victoria to return windfall tax associated with the announced settlement of a long running dispute between the Victorian gas utilities, Gascor and Genvic and their gas suppliers, Esso and BHP. The dispute concerned the ability of the producers to pass on to the Victorian utilities the impact of the Commonwealth's petroleum resource rent tax, PRRT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has long supported a negotiated settlement to the dispute as being in the best interest of both parties. The agreement reached between the parties involves, among other issues, the Victorian government making a payment to the producers of just over $1 billion to resolve the dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key element underpinning the agreement between the producers and the Victorian government was the understanding that windfall tax arising from the $1 billion would be paid to Victoria through a payment to Gascor. The settlement would not go ahead without this arrangement being put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Taxation Office has determined that the settlement payment made to the producers is subject to both company tax and PRRT. This will involve a payment to the Commonwealth of an amount of tax of around $625 million. The Commonwealth has determined that approximately $555 million of that amount reflects windfall tax. That is, approximately $70 million, representing tax payable on amounts previously unpaid by the gas utilities, but not relating to PRRT, will be retained by the Commonwealth and applied to the budget deficit.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7235">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The genesis of this dispute dates back to the extension of the petroleum resource rent tax regime to the Bass Strait, through the enactment of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. The act provided that PRRT was to apply on profits recovered from the Bass Strait permit area on or after 1 July 1990, replacing the existing excise and royalty regime. It was expected that the change in taxation arrangements to one based on taxable profits from a petroleum project rather than on production levels would encourage increased activity in the area. This in fact proved to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was recognised at the time that the transition to a new taxation regime could cause changes to Victorian gas prices, with possible disruptive consequences for industry and domestic consumers. The then government provided the Victorian government with a special grant of $30 million for each of the first two years of application of the PRRT to minimise these transitional pressures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, what was not known by the Commonwealth at the time was that clauses in long-term gas supply agreements between the Victorian gas utilities and Esso&hyphen;BHP would give rise to a dispute about the ability of the producers to pass on the impact of the PRRT to the utilities. This dispute has been the subject of arbitration over a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be recognised that it has always been the intention that the PRRT should be a tax on above normal profits&mdash;that is, profits over and above project expenditure and a threshold rate of return&mdash;associated with offshore projects and should not necessarily flow through to gas prices. Given the unintended nature of the pass-on dispute, and in order to facilitate its settlement, the Commonwealth has indicated that it should not seek to benefit financially from this settlement. Hence this bill is intended to provide a mechanism to return the windfall tax flowing from the settlement. This should be seen as a fair and reasonable outcome for all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The short time frame for consideration of this issue by the parliament is unavoidable, given the sensitive nature of the complex negotiations. The settlement has been struc tured so that a simultaneous exchange of cheques between Gascor, Esso&hyphen;BHP and the Commonwealth will be made on the payment day. However, if the payment to Victoria is not able to be made on the contracted day, the Commonwealth has agreed to pay to Victoria an additional amount reflecting interest accruing up to the actual payment date. The agreement also puts in place a mechanism to ensure that, should future events mean that the assessed tax payable on the settlement amount is changed, this will be reflected in a corresponding flow of funds between the parties. It is designed to ensure the Commonwealth would be no better or worse off under these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resolution of this dispute in a manner acceptable to all parties is to be welcomed. Passage of this special appropriation bill will facilitate the settlement process. It is also expected that the resolution of this dispute will facilitate the opening up of gas markets in Victoria to the benefit of gas consumers. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains an explanation of the provisions of the bill. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(11.33 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is prepared to cooperate with the government in ensuring the speedy passage of the Payment of Tax Receipts (Victoria) Bill which is, as has been said in the government's second reading speech, necessary to enable formal settlement to take place next week of the long&hyphen;running dispute over the impact of the petroleum resource rent tax between the Victorian Bass Strait gas producers, Esso&hyphen;BHP and the Victorian gas utilities. As Minister for Resources and Energy when the old concept of RRT was first mooted, I have to confess to a certain nostalgia about the kinds of issues that we are now dealing with today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7236"> When PRRT was applied to gas by the Labor government in 1990, replacing the existing excise and royalty regime, it was anticipated that a profit rather than a produc tion based tax would be a significant encourager of new exploration and production activity, and such has proved to be the case. It was a very sensible policy initiative, manifestly. It was all very much to the advantage of Victorian consumers, both domestic and industrial, in particular the petrochemical industries which are crucial to the states and, indeed, the national economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trouble, nonetheless, was lurking, we discovered rather swiftly, with the introduction of this regime in the form of a dispute over the meaning of certain clauses in the long&hyphen;term contracts which had existed between the producers and the utilities. The issue, as has been said, was whether producers could pass on to the utilities the impact of the PRRT: who had to bear the cost of the liability for the difference between the old royalty regime and the new resource rent tax regime?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was always intended, as the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) has just said&mdash;and I note that it is the parliamentary secretary and not the Treasurer (Mr Costello) here, but I understand he has been detained; he would need to have a pretty good excuse for not being here on a piece of legislation as important as this&mdash;that the PRRT be imposed in effect on abnormal profits and not borne by consumers. So the question has been where&mdash;not in the consumption end of the process&mdash;in the production and distribution chain the obligation to pay the tax actually lay, whether it could be passed on from the producers to the utilities or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That issue has now been effectively resolved by agreement of the Victorian government to pay on behalf of the utilities a sum of around $1 billion to the producers to cover both past and future PRRT liability. While this only amounts to about a third of the claim that has been made by the producers, which amounts to closer to $3 billion, the settlement clearly reflects the commercial judgment of both sides as to where the risk of final outcome actually lay if the issue went to final arbitration and litigation. Certainly the opposition does not seek to second&hyphen;guess that particular judgment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of BHP&hyphen;Esso now receiving a $1 billion settlement from Victoria is to expose this amount to tax liability in RRT and company tax so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. An estimated $555 million of this has been agreed, as has been said, to be a windfall gain by the Commonwealth in the sense that this amount would not have been paid by anyone had it not been for this particular settlement. It certainly would not be payable at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government, when in office, had anticipated in discussions with Victoria that such a windfall gain might accrue. We had agreed, in order specifically to encourage a settlement of this kind being reached, that any such windfall gain be in fact paid back to Victoria, subject, of course, to detailed assessment as to the amount of it, in order to again facilitate, encourage and enable the settlement. That situation that was anticipated when we were in government has now come about and it is manifestly in everyone's interests that this formal settlement now proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If settlement of the matter in dispute had not occurred, it is clear that there would be potentially very long further delays as the matter was fought out between the producers and the utilities. I notice that the Victorian Treasurer has said that the dispute may have been protracted for as many as another 10 years. Manifestly, that was in nobody's interest, in particular because a key impact of that, a key result of it, would have been to delay by that duration the very considerably overdue gas reform process&mdash;in particular, in the Victorian context, the removal of Gascor's monopoly of distribution rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That gas reform process was of course very strongly supported by the Labor government. It is a process which we believe can and will result in lower gas prices and certainly will have a very positive impact upon industry as a result. The gas reform process of course involves much more than simply Victorian participation in now more open supply arrangements. What we are talking about is the establishment of a national gas market as part, in fact, of the national competition policy <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7237"> reform process that was initiated by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, it will be recalled, the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, agreed to the principle of free and fair trade in gas between the states. This will allow greater competition between producers and lower prices, as I have already said, for domestic and business consumers of gas; it will enable third parties to access pipelines and compete for the right to sell gas to consumers; and it will allow greater use of gas in electricity generation, which will produce both economic and environmental benefits. The press release by the Treasurer indicates properly that the market for gas in Victoria will now be substantially liberalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this is a note of caution that I just want to introduce at this point: it is acknowledged in that release that a number of residual anti&hyphen;competitive elements will remain in the revised arrangements between Gascor and the producers. We are told that these anti&hyphen;competitive elements will be provided with a so-called section 51(1) exception by the Victorian government. We are concerned, I have to say, that very little information has been provided, so far anyway, to justify the use of that section 51(1) provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer's press release states that the ACCC, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and the National Competition Council were briefed on the residual anti&hyphen;competitive effects of the revised arrangements. However, we have no information on how the competition bodies view the arrangements and whether they believe that these residual arrangements are in fact justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They may be justified in all the circumstances, but they may not be. We simply do not have the information available to make a considered judgment on this issue. I hope that some early opportunity will be taken by the government&mdash;perhaps in reply if the parliamentary secretary is in a position to do so&mdash;to indicate what precisely the state of play is in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I wish to make is this: the second reading speech makes clear that, in addition to the Commonwealth's windfall gain <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> directly related to the RRT issue, the settlement has also resulted in another windfall gain of some $70 million representing tax payable on amounts previously unpaid by the gas utilities, but not in fact relating to PRRT. That $70 million, we are told, the Commonwealth is going to keep and apply to general deficit reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will not be surprised to know that we in opposition have a great many suggestions as to how that windfall $70 million which the government is going to keep and not give back to Victoria might in fact be very usefully spent. Today in the Senate, we are intending to request a number of amendments to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and (No. 2) which spell out, in loving and elaborate detail in fact, many of the areas in which some of that $70 million might be spent very usefully indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by making the suggestion, in all good faith to the government, that it could do no better than to spend at least $55 million of that windfall $70 million on extending, for at least another year, the Commonwealth dental program, which is, I hope the government will finally come to acknowledge, the most indefensible, the most literally shocking, of all the rather ugly budget decisions to cut expenditure, particularly in welfare delivery areas, that are contained in this year's budget. If you are sitting on another $70 million as a result of this overdue exercise, this very welcome exercise by the Victorian government, the utilities and the producers, I hope that something useful will be done with the additional windfall gain you have thus received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7238"> Having said all that, this is a very good thing that this settlement has been finally achieved. The consequences of it go much beyond the mere settlement of this particular outstanding issue that will now open up the scope for the rapid implementation, we all hope, of the national gas market, a new competitive situation applying in Victoria, New South Wales and elsewhere, much to the benefit of consumers and much to the benefit in particular of energy dependent industry. It is something that will be to the great advantage accordingly not only to the Victorian government but to the whole national econ omy. On that basis, I indicate the opposition's support for this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the comments of the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), it is worth noting that he mentioned the Commonwealth dental program. That program was an initiative that was announced by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in the 1993 election campaign. It was initially planned to reduce the waiting lists that were existing in the state dental schemes. For 93 years Australia had not had a Commonwealth dental scheme. In fact, for 10 years of the previous Labor government there was no Commonwealth involvement in the dental area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Payment of Tax Receipts (Victoria) Bill is formalising for the Commonwealth what has been a very elegant solution in solving a dispute which has lasted for five years and which relates back to contracts that were determined in the late 1960s. It involves a simultaneous exchange of cheques between three different entities. Gascor, the utility for gas in Victoria, has resolved its longstanding dispute with Esso and BHP. As a result of that, it will be making to BHP and Esso a lump sum settlement payment of $1.022 billion, which will be assessable for rent tax and company tax. BHP and Esso, which will be assessed for that tax, will pay $625 million in tax to the Commonwealth. Most of that will be windfall tax we were not expecting, but the $70 million which is not part of the windfall will be used to reduce the budget deficit. The Commonwealth will be paying $555 million to Victoria, passing on the windfall tax it has received from Esso and BHP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contracts, established for production in Bass Strait, were between Esso and BHP and the Victorian state utilities, the then SEC and the Gas and Fuel Corporation but the now Generation Victoria and Gascor respectively. Those contracts said that Esso and BHP were required to sell to only the Victorian state utilities and that no other suppliers could provide gas to Gascor and Generation Victoria. These were just two restrictions that resulted from the contracts established in the late 1960s. That has led to a large surplus of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gas in the Bass Strait area. BHP and Esso estimate they could produce something like three times more gas than they currently are, but there has never been any incentive because all they were doing was producing for Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those contracts had a life of 35 years, and they were established in 1969. At that time, Victoria and the producers, Esso and BHP, decided that indirect taxes levied on supply and production could be passed on to the buyers: the utilities of Victoria. The monopoly that has existed with Gascor, the entity previously known as the Gas and Fuel Corporation, and Esso and BHP has really given them little incentive to develop the gas fields in Bass Strait, because they could supply gas to only Victoria&mdash;and Victoria is a mature market. The prices in those contracts were established prior to the two oil shocks of the 1970s. They were established in 1969 and fixed for 35 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Holt mentioned, in 1990 the previous Labor government decided to abolish the complex excise and royalty regimes that had existed in the area of gas production and to substitute them with a petrol resource rent tax, which taxed profits on offshore oil and gas production at about 40 per cent. Since 1990, BHP and Esso have been paying that tax, although the contract did mention the contract initially signed so that they could pass it on to the state government utilities. They have been sending the bills to Victoria, and this is what the dispute has been all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7239"> The settlement is, at just over $1 billion, roughly the size of the bills unpaid for resource rent tax. When we take into account the difference between the lump sum payment and the amount the Commonwealth will appropriate to Victoria through this bill, the settlement will cost Victoria about $425 million. But it removes what the Auditor&hyphen;General of Victoria has estimated as a $3 billion future exposure for the lifetime of this contract, based on their requirements under the initial contracts. Alan Stockdale, the Treasurer of Victoria, has said that the settlement of this dispute will not affect current gas prices because Gascor and Generation Vic toria will be increasing their buyings rather than passing the $425 million on to consumers. Net liabilities of those utilities will increase from $600 million to approximately $1 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for the great difference between the contract price, which was 27c per gigajoule, and the market price, which was $4.14 per gigajoule, is that the contract price was established in contracts set up prior to the energy crises of the 1970s. The Victorian government has pocketed the difference. The new contracts to be drawn up between BHP and Esso and the state government of Victoria will run from 2001 to 2009. They will be changed a lot more often; there will not be any 35&hyphen;year contracts in the future. Also, those contracts will be market based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> headed `What a Gas! Everyone Wins!' describes this as a `breakthrough' for thousands of Australian businesses being crippled by high energy costs. This solution has removed the last major obstruction to the creation of just one gas market in south&hyphen;eastern Australia. What it will do is decrease the gas prices paid by consumers and by businesses in New South Wales. It will also be able to create new investment. For example, BHP has proposed building a pipeline from Longford to Sydney. Previously, the situation with the intrastate monopolies has meant that was not viable. It will now be viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another proposal that has been floated is one linking the Victorian and New South Wales grids with a pipeline between Albury and Wagga Wagga. The solution will allow the Victorian government to move the gas industry to a more competitive structure. For the Commonwealth government, there are benefits as well. The restrictions that this removes will open up the gasfields and will lead to an increase in resource rent tax over the next 10 years. In fact, it has been estimated that this could bring in an additional $300 million in income per year from the resource rent tax, just due to the expansion that is possible in the Bass Strait oilfields.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria have all been regulated, intrastate monopolies. The Santos&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> led group has been supplying Cooper Basin gas to South Australia and New South Wales, and BHP and Esso have been supplying gas to Victoria. The solution will enable Victoria to meet its commitments, agreed to at the COAG meeting, to establish a competitive national gas market. Those commitments have been dependent upon Victoria achieving a resolution to this dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contracts which were established in the late 1960s will now be reformed and will remove the restrictions on Esso&hyphen;BHP selling gas to end consumers in Victoria. They will also remove the obligation on Gascor to take gas exclusively from Esso&hyphen;BHP to supply all of Victoria which is connected with the Longford pipeline. They also remove restrictions on Esso&hyphen;BHP to build pipelines in Victoria and also to market gas in the other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While initially this will not see a great change&mdash;I imagine that Esso&hyphen;BHP will still largely be supplying gas to Victoria, and the Cooper Basin group will still supply gas to New South Wales and South Australia&mdash;in the long term we will see a more competitive situation which will allow an expansion of gas production in Australia and in the long term this solution should lead to lower gas prices for consumers and businesses. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (11.55 a.m.)&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to thank the opposition for its cooperation in regard to the Payment of Tax Receipts (Victoria) Bill 1996.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senate amendment No. 2 appears to have the effect of making a reduction in the number of taxpayers who will obtain the benefit of the increase in the tax&hyphen;free threshold which is central to the family tax assistance initiative.

This is because of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution which provides that the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The overriding consideration, in my view, is the matter of principle and respect for and regard to the terms of the constitution. I acknowledge that in the circumstances it will be difficult for the House to reach a conclu sive understanding of this matter.

It will also be difficult for any satisfactory dialogue to take place between the houses on the specific matter of the purported amendments to this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think what the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) wants to do is sweep the constitutional provisions under the carpet without telling the opposition beforehand, without giving the opposition the decency and the courtesy of notice of this constitutional question. The first I had heard of it, as shadow minister taking the bill, was when the Deputy Speaker read out a short statement. Then one of the clerks handed me the relevant motion that the parliamentary secretary then stood up and moved</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is sufficient for the parliamentary secretary to stand up and say, `We support the words and judgment of the Speaker in this matter, but we think there is a public interest consideration which is so pressing that the House now needs to deal with the bill as a matter of urgency, forgetting all about the constitutional questions.' If the parliamentary secretary supports the statement of the Speaker, does he support the sentence that was read out: `There is significant doubt as to whether the Senate may proceed in such instances by way of amendment'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought it would be very important for the parliament to deal with a significant doubt that has been raised by the Speaker and not just say in part 2 of the motion, now moved by the parliamentary secretary, that there is some public interest demand for the early enactment of the legislation. It is not the view of the opposition that there is a public interest demand for the early enactment of the legislation; the view of the opposition is there should be proper regard for process. The proper regard for process would be to have a parliamentary debate about the provisions of paragraph 3 of section 53 of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks (Mr Melham), who fortunately is at the table, chaired a parliamentary inquiry and delivered an outstanding report on the provisions of paragraph 3 of section 53. Why was he not notified of the terms of this debate now before the parliament and the motion moved by the parliamentary secretary? I believe it is the height of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indecency and it is the height of parliamentary malpractice to not give the opposition notification of something as important as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time after time on these tax matters it is the parliamentary secretary who is wheeled in to read out notes provided to him by public servants. We have never once seen the Commonwealth Treasurer (Mr Costello) deal with a taxation bill. We never see Mr Costello in this House on taxation legislation. This is the same government which said they would make the powers of the parliament supreme over the executive. If the parliament is supreme over the executive, why do we not see the executive minister who has responsibility for taxation instead of the parliamentary secretary? He is not the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer; he is the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister. As such, he has no direct responsibility for taxation matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition wishes to record that objection. It should be the Treasurer handling this matter, not a parliamentary secretary divorced totally from any responsibility on taxation matters. It should also be recorded that the government should have had the decency and the courtesy to notify the opposition of this major issue concerning paragraph 3 of section 53 of the Australian constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government members, most of all a minister, should not scoff at the idea that the constitution is important. This is the side of parliament that is always lecturing Australians about the importance of upholding the constitution&mdash;constitutional tradition. The constitutional tradition on paragraph 3 of section 53 is that it is an important part of our legal framework and something that should not be swept under the carpet in the motion that has now been put by the parliamentary secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition, as I understand it, is not in a position to divide on a matter like this because we understand the weight of government numbers. We also understand that the government would have far better cooperation on these matters if it displayed base courtesy in letting the opposition know that an opinion had been provided to the Speaker which cast `significant doubt as to whether the Senate <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7242"> may proceed in such instances by way of amendment'. I am very disappointed that the government is not displaying any courtesy or seeking any cooperation from the opposition on this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very disappointed that we did not have the Speaker himself in the chamber. Where is the Speaker? He should be in that chair providing his opinion on paragraph 3 of section 53 rather than handing a note to a Deputy Speaker who is on roster and who is obliged to read out the opinion of the Speaker.</PARA>

If he has a statement to make to this House, if it is a statement headed on the written document `Statement by Speaker' and if it is a statement that relates to an unresolved part of the constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia&mdash;paragraph 3 of section 53&mdash;the Speaker should discharge his responsibilities by coming into this House and giving us the statement that stands in his name. He should also be available for questioning by members about the legal advice that has been made available to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not sufficient for a government which said it would be boosting the powers in respect of this parliament to treat us in such a shabby way. The Speaker should be in that chair, the Treasurer should be in that chair and we should have the right&mdash;indeed, we do have the right&mdash;to question the Speaker about the legal opinion that has been made available to him, especially when so recently, just last year, the member for Banks chaired an extensive parliamentary inquiry into the terms and conditions of paragraph 3 of section 53 of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note again the `significant doubt as to whether the Senate may proceed in such instances by way of amendment'. It is suggested here the motion be moved by a minister. It has not been moved by a minister; it has been moved by a parliamentary secretary with no responsibility for the matter now before the House. I doubt very much whether <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there is public interest demand for the early enactment of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was going to mention in the substance of the Senate amendments a whole range of concerns the opposition has about the administrative efficiency, or rather inefficiency, of the way in which the government is now handling the so-called family tax initiative. A whole raft of matters need to be sorted out in the administration of that particular bill&mdash;the compliance costs to employers, the availability of information for the family tax initiative coming into force on 1 January, the confusion as to the arrangements of families where the parents have separated but still have dependent children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the truth be known, on the family tax initiative the government have created for themselves a legislative and administrative nightmare. They have now realised that. They have got some advice from the public servants, who know it is a nightmare, who know that this is the worst possible way to administer a family tax benefit. They have tried to get it up as fast as they could through the Senate, a questionable amendment moved by the Senate, knowing full well that there would be an important constitutional doubt cast over that process when it came back to this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pretty shabby stuff all round, shabby in the type of people who are here in the House to handle the matter: we do not have the Treasurer&mdash;we have a parliamentary secretary; we did not have the Speaker reading out his own statement&mdash;we had a Deputy Speaker who was obliged to read it out on his behalf. We do not have access to ask questions to the Speaker. We do not have access to the legal advice upon which the Speaker has made this statement. We do not have an explanation from the government as to why, knowing these things, knowing the doubt about paragraph 3 of section 53 of the constitution, they still persisted with moving Senate amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why doesn't the government follow due process and recommit the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill before the House of Representatives so that the amendments can be moved here first and foremost? This is just one symbol and one <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7243"> sign of the way in which the government has created an administrative nightmare for itself in the handling of this family tax initiative. The proper procedure is not, as the Speaker said, to cast `significant doubt as to whether the Senate may proceed in such instances by way of amendment'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proper procedure is to recommit the bill to the House of Representatives. If the government did that, there would be no question whatsoever about the terms and conditions of the third paragraph of section 53. This is a serious matter. The House should note with due gravity that we are now considering an amendment by the Senate that we are going to deal with in return by way of a request&mdash;when the Speaker himself has cast doubt on whether it is available to the House to do those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This really is a terrible moment in terms of process and a terrible moment for a government which promised the people of Australia that it would uphold the powers&mdash;indeed, boost the powers&mdash;of the House of Representatives ahead of an executive government. Executive government has made the mistake, Parliamentary Secretary Miles. You probably do not have an awareness of these things because the Treasurer is not here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Executive government has made the mistake in the drafting of the bill. It has made the mistake in the way in which it is to be administered. It has had to scramble up to the Senate, knowing full well that these provisions really should not have been placed before the Senate but should have been recommitted to the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the government is calling on the opposition to just sit here smiling as they bodgie up the process. They are bodgying up the process with a statement read out casting significant doubt on the process. And they expect the opposition to regard their motion&mdash;which said there is some public demand for the early enactment of the legislation&mdash;as accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no public demand for the early enactment of the legislation. There is public demand for due process. There is public demand for treating the House of Representatives with proper respect. And there is public <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> demand for getting the administrative terms of the family tax initiative correct, not having to do it through some bodgied up process knowing full well that it would be doubtful as to how the House of Representatives could deal with any Senate amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a terrible moment for the House. I again record the opposition's concern that it has been asked to deal with these matters without consultation, without prior notice and without the proper tenets of due process.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is significant doubt as to whether the Senate may proceed in such instances by way of amendment.

Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, it gives me some sense of satisfaction that you should have been involved in such an important message from the Speaker about the powers of the House in respect of money bills but, like the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham)&mdash;without wishing to reflect on you&mdash;it would have been nice if the Speaker was in the chamber for such an important message.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are talking about the respective powers of the Senate and the House, I am a little embarrassed that I have perhaps previously considered some of the Senate's powers as too much and, as a government backbench member, very frustrating. In opposition you learn to understand some of the benefits the Senate has in consideration of legislation&mdash;its ability to actually extract the detail behind legislation. I would in no way wish to reflect on the powers of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I do believe the message from the Speaker is a very important one. As both shadow ministers on the opposition side have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7245"> stated, there is no disagreement on either side of the House on the interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. It is pleasing that that should be the case. The Senate doesn't have the power to affect the tax burden on ordinary people, yet your message alerts us to the fact that the schedule of amendments made by the Senate has this very direct consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The parliamentary secretary has been very courteous to me&mdash;and I am grateful&mdash;in allowing me to make a small contribution. Again, I make the point that, if this House is to function and the prerogatives of the House are to be maintained, it is really important that courtesy be extended to the opposition, particularly to the shadow minister, in foreshadowing that this bill would be coming up and the likelihood of the Speaker making such an important statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is unfortunate that on these bills we, as a House, do not have a proper opportunity to address the constitutional issue that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have placed before us in the statement you read out on behalf of the Speaker. I sincerely hope&mdash;this being a sitting Thursday in the last week of a parliamentary sitting&mdash;that at some future date the government may consider that the issue is of sufficient importance and gravity for there to be an appropriate parliamentary debate about section 53 of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members on both sides of the House are very concerned at all times to ensure that the constitution is followed. Indeed, the government has a track record of insisting on this, more so than perhaps us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of summary, it is a pity that proper courtesies were not extended to the opposition on this matter and that the Speaker himself was not able to be present in the chamber, given the importance of the Speaker's message that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, read out. Last but not least, I hope there will be a future opportunity where the support of all honourable members about the constitution in this instance can be brought to a head and debated and an appropriate message sent to the Senate.

I understand the comments from one or two people in the opposition on the way in which this matter has been dealt with by the government. First of all, can I make it very clear that we are following exactly the same procedure as the former government followed with us in regard to this matter. So, in getting the forewarning, we are dealing with the Speaker's statement in the same way this matter was dealt with previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) that, if he wants further information on the legal basis for this, he might refer to the speeches by his current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the then Assistant Treasurer, the former member for Canning, Mr Gear, so that he might be more acquainted with the way in which the previous government dealt with it. I am just saying that this government is following precedent. There is nothing unusual about it. There is quite a bit of fuss being made by the member for Werriwa about this. I just want to put it on the record that we are following the same sort of procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The member for Werriwa also made the comment that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was not in here and was not having carriage of the matter. Neither is the shadow Treasurer in here taking carriage of it. That is okay. All I am saying is that I have responsibility for carriage of this bill through the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the public interest, I would think that the Australian people out there who have been told that they are going to get some tax cuts would have a great deal of interest in family taxation cuts of $1 billion. There is certainly public interest amongst families right throughout this country looking for a $1 billion cut, looking for $1 billion back in their pockets on 1 January. They know this is coming.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition understands the situation to be one where the government has maladministered its own legislation and is now seeking the Senate to bail it out by way of amendment, an amendment that many people in this House believe the Senate does not have the right to move, let alone to seek to impose upon the House of Representatives. The proper way of handling this matter would have been either for the government to recommit the bill to the House of Representatives or for the Senate to make a request and nothing more than a request; not for the Senate to exercise powers that many in the House believe are beyond its jurisdiction and charter, constitutionally and morally. It is very important for the House to recognise those points. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is very concerned that the government is using incorrect practice, using false powers of the Senate, to try to tidy up the administrative nightmare of its own legislation. We all know that this family tax initiative was not framed by reasoned, diligent and rational policy makers; it was framed by a Liberal Party focus group which was told, `John Howard will give you a big fistful of dollars in this election campaign. How would you like it paid to you?' That focus group said, `We do not really regard ourselves as welfare recipients, so we do not want it in terms of a Social Security cheque that might arrive every month, like the basic family payment.' They said, `Why don't you pay it through the tax system?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the person organising the focus group, with Andrew Robb taking notes on the other side of the one&hyphen;way glass, said, `What if we do it through a change to the tax free threshold instead of a rebate which would be the most efficient way to pay the benefit&mdash;a rebate at the end of the financial year?' The taxpayers said, `We like the idea of getting the benefit on an ongoing basis through PAYE deductions rather than an end of year rebate.' So that is how the Liberal Party devised its family tax initiative. It was poll driven; it was focus group driven; it was research driven. But something happened to this policy on the way to the forum. They handed it over to the bureaucrats in the federal Public Service who said that it may well be research driven but it is not administratively sound.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7248">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first amendment will include the income of a taxpayer's spouse and the family income where the spouse is under a legal disability and the spouse's only income is the share of income from a trust.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the most inefficient way to administer this provision. This amendment would not be necessary if the government had paid this family tax initiative by way of an end of year tax rebate or if the government had decided to pay this tax initiative by a weighted adjustment to the basic family payments. So there is no doubt that the government has got itself into trouble on the amendment now before the House. It is in trouble because it did not follow good public policy principles, it did not follow sound administrative practice; it followed the findings of a focus group. It followed the findings of a survey group, conducted and paid for by the Liberal Party, to find the most electorally popular way to present a fistful of dollars at the 1996 election and gain public support. That is why the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) is in so much trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask him to explain the meaning of the amendment presented by Senator Kemp. In particular, what is the meaning of `legal disability' that the government brings to this matter? This is a way the opposition can scrutinise your provisions. The House is not even aware of what you mean by `legal disability' and `the spouse's only income is the share of income from a trust'. So not even the parliamentary secretary is able to explain the provisions now before the House. They have got themselves into a terrible mess in the administration of this matter. That is why I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after that be deleted with a view to substituting the following words: the amendments be referred to a conference between the House of Representatives and the Senate where they can address the problems with amendment No. 1 and all the other administrative inefficiencies of the family tax initiative.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been speaking to the statement that the Speaker gave the House on Senate amendment No. 2, which is now before the House. It appears to have the effect of making a reduction in the number of taxpayers who will obtain the benefit of the increase in the tax free threshold which is central to the family tax assistance initiatives. I was asking the question: why is the government at this late stage taking away its much touted and much vaunted family tax initiative from a body of Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer as to why the government has had to use the false powers of the Senate to carry an amendment now before the House is that there are a whole range of administrative inefficiencies concerning the family tax initiative of which this amendment is but one. The amendment, for instance, is related to the fact that employers now have to notify the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7253"> Tax Office of a change in the PAYE deductions for each employee. Therefore, there is a huge increase in compliance costs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also raises the question: how will people know? How will people know of their eligibility for the family tax initiative by 1 January if the government is not telling them? Most people expect these things to be paid as a rebate at the end of the financial year. There is a problem in the spread of information. There will be a group of Australians who just will not know of their eligibility on 1 January.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another problem. What happens if both parents claim simultaneously for the family tax initiative? This is the problem with a tax system based on individuals, yet the benefit is being paid to families. There will have to be a huge data matching exercise within the Tax Office to try to deal with the problem of double dipping. This particular set of amendments illustrates the problem the government has in the prevention of double dipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a further problem. What happens where the benefit is being paid even though the parents are living apart? Apparently, parents will have to keep a logbook. We will have the extraordinary circumstance of parents keeping a logbook on the amount of time that they have care of and are paying for dependants vis-a-vis the amount of time the dependants spend with the former partner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a range of inefficiencies that is adding to compliance costs for employers. Those inefficiencies are causing distress in the community. They will lead to the absurd situation of parents having to keep a logbook on the amount of custody that they have for one of their children if the parents are separated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to take up too much time of the House. I just wanted to make a couple of comments about this amendment before it was closed off. The point that I wanted to make again was that I think constitutionally the better way of handling these requested amendments, as they are in a sense technical adjustments of the original bill, was for the government to have reintroduced the bill in the House of Representatives and then again forwarded it on to the Senate. That was the better constitutional way to handle these matters to facilitate these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a sense, I had to respond to the challenge of the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) when he said, `The breadth of these amendments actually touches the families of Australia.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Cunningham. He is an astute judge in these matters. I cannot say that I am aware of any of my constituents' spouses being such beneficiaries. I cannot think of one.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to misrepresent the situation when I say that not one person in my electorate will benefit from these measures. In fact, they are not designed to benefit from these measures.

They are certainly not in the wealthy brigade who can spend thousands of dollars rearranging their tax affairs to pay a minimal amount of tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is pleased to support this amendment to the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill. We note that the first two amendments were taking away eligibility for the family tax initiative, contrary to government election promises. This is an amendment which, as was outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), seeks to confer eligibility on parents who have separated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of this provision, however, it is worth repeating that the opposition does not regard the Senate as having a legitimate authority or power to move an amendment; it should have come to us by way of a request. But now it is here, and now that it has been put by the parliamentary secretary, it is appropriate to raise the whole raft of administrative difficulties that the government has with the family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a provision that relates to parents when they separate. It is worth noting that the situation where two or more people jointly maintain a dependant and those people do not reside together was to be dealt with in the proposed section 20L of the bill, which provides that the child will only be considered to be a dependant for the days when the taxpayer has care of the child for the night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that, for members who are worried about privacy and the basic rights of citizens to privacy, this is a new infringement that the government is imposing upon the citizens of Australia in an attempt to force them to keep a logbook to determine for taxation purposes whether or not their dependent child stayed for the night. And not only that, the government is further breaching privacy by forcing parents to keep a logbook for the amount of time that they have dependent children within their care. The administrative efficiency of it is a total nightmare; the administrative arrangements are a total nightmare. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7255">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me raise a hypothetical situation to illustrate what will happen. Say one parent starts out the PAYE period with 70 per cent of the care of the dependent child and the other parent, separated, 30 per cent. Because the government is paying this through PAYE deductions rather than through a rebate, if the 70/30 ratio changes at any time, the employer will have to be notified, and will subsequently have to change the PAYE deduction to reflect, say, a change to 50/50. Imagine the administrative nightmare and the inconvenience and the breach of privacy for people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, they have to keep a log as to how many nights the dependent child spent with them. These arrangements are always flexible and fluid. If the arrangements change and go from 70/30 to 50/50 they have to present a log to their employer to say that the child is now half in their care instead of 70 per cent; they have to ask the employer to alter the PAYE deduction for the purpose of the family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government clearly had not thought any of these things through before it brought the family tax initiative legislation into the House. I note the concern that is echoed on the faces of the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) now that the penny has dropped. The penny has dropped that their much vaunted family tax initiative is an administrative nightmare. What you are setting up in the name of family values is a tax logbook on separated parents: when they have the care of a dependant in their house for the night&mdash;not for the day, necessarily, just for the night&mdash;they need to put it on the night log. If those arrangements change from PAYE period to PAYE period, they have to tell their employer of that and he will notify the Taxation Office through a change to the PAYE deduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an extraordinarily draconian provision for a government to impose. It is a nightmare for people in terms of their right to privacy. Why should employers know the arrangements that their employees have with regard to dependent children? Why should they have the right to know how many nights their separated employees have dependent children in their houses? Why do they have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that right to know? Why, even, does the Taxation Office have that right to know? The answer is: because the government engaged in the folly of not paying this as a rebate or a cash transfer. They decided to pay it by virtue of their electoral research and by virtue of their focus group findings. They decided to pay it as a PAYE deduction. That has led to a whole series of administrative inefficiencies and privacy concerns that this parliament should note.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for McPherson looks as though he is about to jump to his feet. He is one of the executive members of the Lyons Forum. He is one of the creators of this family tax initiative. Let him explain to separated parents in Australia why they need to keep a taxation logbook every night they have a dependent child in their house. Let him explain why employers should have access to that information. Let him explain why the tax office should.

That is when he did not agree with the amendments, because they in fact did what he could hardly argue against, and that is ensure that these benefits were properly targeted. What he is trying to argue now is that somehow targeting is an issue. It has always been an issue for both houses of this parliament that we are concerned about benefits being properly targeted, and yet the argument that he now puts forward in some sense is that it should not be so.

This is a tax rebate and the member for Werriwa was correct in suggesting it could be delivered at the end of the year, but the obvious point of that is that that would not give the maximum advantage. The point of doing it through the PAYE system is to make sure the families benefited from it immediately, so on the first payday after 1 January all of the families in Australia that are eligible for this $1 billion tax cut will get it in their tax packets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to hear that it is voluntary. What do we do about a dispute? What do we do in a situation where both of the separated parents are claiming substantive care of the dependent child? They are both claiming, say, 80 or 90 per cent of the dependent care of the child. How does the tax office deal with that situation if we are not to have some form of record like a logbook? I would have thought what the parliamentary secretary has done to the taxation system is to encourage everyone to claim as much as they feel inclined to claim. If they want to claim 80 and 80, 160, why not? The government will pay 160 per cent benefit. Is that the case? If the government is to police this properly, certainly it needs to have some form of administrative system in place. I would be very surprised indeed if the parliamentary secretary's assurance holds that there will be no breach of privacy as that administrative system is put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As he mentioned, this final amendment on the bill deals with the question of double dipping. So the nightmare of the family tax initiative and its administration gets worse. Not only are there the compliance costs for employers of constantly changing their PAYE deductions, not only is there the breach of privacy for separated parents as their employer and the tax office know the arrangements that they have struck in their private life&mdash;the nightmare on Lyons Street gets even worse. The nightmare on Lyons Street gets even worse because the Lyons Forum has now run into the problem of how to prevent double dipping. It probably is very difficult in these circumstances to prevent a situation where both parents will claim for the family tax initiative. This is a problem of a taxation system in Australia based on individual income yet the benefit being paid to family units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7257"> If both parents claim, what is the government going to do about it? What is the government going to do about double dipping other than this amendment here, the sole purpose of which is to beg people to volun teer the tax file number of their spouse as they lodge their application for the family tax initiative?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is begging people to do the right thing but people are not obliged to lodge the tax file number of their spouse as they themselves apply for the family tax initiative. This creates a very interesting situation as to what the Taxation Office will do to try to prevent double dipping. I would have thought it would generate a huge data matching exercise for the Taxation Office. The ATO will now have to match the data from spouse to spouse right across Australia. I know that the Lyons Forum is all about keeping people together in holy wedlock but they are going to be doing it through the tax office by matching people up against each other with their tax file number.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue on the final amendment is one of double dipping. The government has created a nightmare for the Taxation Office. There are additional compliance costs on employers. So much for the recommendations of your small business report which was going to lower compliance costs on small business. Each small business in Australia will now have to alter PAYE tax deductions on a weekly or monthly basis because there has been a change in the household care of dependent children that then flows on to the family tax initiative. We not only have a breach of privacy, we have the problem of how the Taxation Office stops double dipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no compulsion on people to provide the tax file number of their spouse. That is only voluntary, and if people do not volunteer there will have to be a huge data matching exercise thereby adding to the costs of running Australia's taxation system.

They are trying to police the situation with their own flawed family tax initiative to stop double dipping when the sensible thing to do would be to allocate those resources to the real purpose of tax policing in Australia, to catch the big corporate crooks, the tax fraud at the big end of town. Instead, resources will be spent looking through the bedroom windows of Australians through the introduction of this logbook to see what arrangements they are making with their dependent children.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7258">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Braddon (Mr Miles) earned a reputation in this parliament for wanting the Tasmanian police to look through the bedroom windows of consenting adults on the question of the sex laws and, true to form, he now wants the Taxation Office to be looking through the bedroom windows of Australians to work out whether or not their dependent child is there, whether or not the logbook is correct and whether or not double dipping is taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that the government really should have accepted the Labor Party's proposal at the beginning of this debate to have a conference between the House and the Senate to look at the gross administrative inefficiencies of the family tax initiative and see how its administration is unravelling day after day after day. Do something positive about lowering compliance costs for small business. Do something positive about protecting the privacy of Australian citizens. Do something positive about an effective means to stop the potential for double dipping on the family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has rejected those things and it is to its lasting shame that it could not find a better way. It is the old message in public life: good policy stands on its own; good policy leads to sound administration. The government engaged in base electoral research to work out the way in which Australian families would want the family tax initiative paid. As Mr Howard offered his fistful of dollars, the researchers said, `Pay it through the tax system with PAYE deductions.' In terms of administration, that focus group was wrong, the Lyons Forum was wrong, and the government was wrong.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw the statement. I just note that the person concerned was not offended. I was addressing the question of the minister's responsibilities, or lack of them, because it is relevant to this debate on Cus <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> toms and the responsibilities which he is pursuing, as well as the stated aims when he took over this portfolio as to what he was going to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned one of the things that he said he is not responsible for when he was caught up with conflict of interest. I mention another. On a previous occasion I pointed to his involvement in petrol retailing, again through his private company, again through his directorship of it, at the same time advocating policy measures that would put money back into the pockets of petrol retailers. When we pointed this out to him, he said he was not responsible for that either. Even though he was minister for consumer affairs, he was not responsible for petrol retailing. He was acting for some other minister in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could say that is a reasonable defence, but it is not what he was saying before the meeting or after it. He went to the meeting. The question of the temperature control of petrol was on the agenda of the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs meeting. It was the reason he issued a press release on the matter under his title as minister for consumer affairs, and those press statements discussed the impact of the measure on consumers. Though he saw no need at the meeting itself to declare that he was representing another minister, it was his defence in this House when he got nailed. So I am pleased to say that we have got a minister who is responsible for doing something in his portfolio, because he has denied any involvement in other activities that we have nailed him on previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also go to the question of his responsibility for the diesel fuel rebate. The minister, through his directorship and control of Prosser Automotive Engineers Pty Ltd, does deal in diesel fuel and he has got responsibility for administering the act that sets the rates and conditions under which the diesel fuel rebate can be obtained. Yet, when this conflict of interest was pointed out, he said there was no conflict of interest here either because his companies are not eligible to claim the diesel fuel rebate. This is hardly the point. While diesel users claim the rebate, those who deal in diesel benefit from the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7261"> rebate's retention, and that is still an issue on which the minister has not been prepared to address this House or his Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see he has finally turned up in the House. He was not here to defend his bill. He has never defended himself, except for the blood and the toil and the teary&hyphen;eyed speech, and he still will not come into this place and explain the blatant conflicts of interest inherent in his continued activities: diesel fuel rebate, construction, consumer affairs&mdash;you name them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, what is really involved in this is not the issue of whether there is evidence that the minister has deliberately sought to profit; it is the question of the appearance of the conflict of interest. The appearance occurs over and over again with this minister. So it is pleasing to find today that the minister is responsible for something, because he has been denying all along that he is responsible for the things that he has got caught on. I thought that you were obtaining your money under false pretences, Minister, because every time we identified issues that you are in conflict with, you said, `No, I'm not responsible for that. No, I don't deal with that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that he has actually got responsibility for something, and it has to deal with the Customs Service. I am sure that people who work in the Customs Service would have hoped that he ducked this issue too, because, when you look at the issues that he has involved himself in there&mdash;a $70 million cut over the next four years to the service, 105 jobs gone in Victoria, 65 in New South Wales, 60 in the ACT, 25 in Queensland, 20 in Western Australia, and the complete ending of airport shiftwork&mdash;they would wish he had not been involved in this either.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, my question is also addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. I ask: is the minister aware of comments that private health insurance premium changes announced by two funds yesterday are `massive', and that the changes to health fund products are hiding premium increases? How reliable, Minister, are these assertions? Is it not the case that the overwhelming factor in the need for necessary private health insurance premium changes is the lingering effect of 13 years of Labor government administration?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="7262" SPEAKER="Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP" NAMEID="8E4" ELECTORATE="Chisholm" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Health and Family Services" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. He obviously has hit the point right on the head because the fact is that what we are experiencing now is the result of what the funds experienced over <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the 1995&hyphen;96 financial year. Funds right across Australia had a pretty tough time then, and they are having a tough time now because the make&hyphen;up of their membership base is changing. People who are over 65 are making up a greater proportion of people who have private health insurance. I say 65 because that is the age at which people generally draw more than a dollar having put a dollar in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in fact something that has happened progressively over a number of years. The trouble that the Labor Party has is that they basically do not like private health insurance. This was put very well in August by the former health minister, Graham Richardson, who said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I steered a package through the cabinet but resigned before I could sell it to the caucus. Practically the whole package died when I left the Labor Party because the Labor Party has always been a bit biased against private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, you only have to look at their record. We hear the Labor Party bleating about premium increases, but between 1986 and 1988 they went up 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Opposition members interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What did you do about it? Nothing. You sat on your hands and you rubber&hyphen;stamped every premium increase. And then, between 1991 and 1992, in the financial year, they went up by 17 per cent. So what you did was you hit the old, you hit the frail, you hit the 700,000 people who had incomes under $20,000 a year who still were clinging on to their private health insurance. And you did it because you are a bit biased against private health insurance. It was purely ideologically driven.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And how did you do it? You did it very simply. You abolished the federal government's contribution to the reinsurance bill between 1983 and 1989, and you whacked $100 million onto the cost of premiums of private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You reduced the Commonwealth bed&hyphen;day subsidy in September 1986 and you whacked another $135 million onto the cost of private health insurance. You then reduced the Medicare rebate for in&hyphen;hospital services from 85 per cent to 75 per cent and you whacked that onto private health insurance premiums. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7263"> According to Access Economics, that added, in today's dollars, $846 million onto the cost of private health insurance premiums. That means premiums today are 39 per cent higher than they would have been had you not taken those decisions. Now we see the crocodile tears, we hear the bleating, we hear the gnashing of the teeth, the tearing at the heartstrings, but basically you have always been a bit biased against private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to these recent increases, yesterday Medibank Private and MBF announced that there would be premium increases. I approved the increase for MBF on Tuesday. I approved the increase for Medibank Private on Wednesday. When I say `approved', I said that I had no grounds to disallow them. The fact is that, even if you look at those two premium increases, if you average all premiums over recent times, the average increase is a little bit more than six per cent. That is no different from the average increase between March and August. That compares to 12 per cent per year average that you let go through. If you have a look at between 1983 and 1996, you will see that the Labor ministers for health never once intervened. You gave it the tick, you gave it the rubber stamp and you let a 40 per cent increase in two years between 1986 and 1988 go through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would prefer that there were no increases at all. At least with these two premium increases, I have been able to  intervene. I have asked Medibank Private and MBF to go back and re&hyphen;work their figures. I have asked them to look at their assumptions again, and they did. Not only have the premium increases that have come in been less than what they would have been otherwise&mdash;something you never did because you are a bit biased against private health insurance&mdash;but also they have been deferred, and that is good news for private health insurance. It is good news for the contributors. At least I am having a go. You never had the guts to.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. Of course, I have addressed the prudential requirements which were taken into account by the minister for health and detailed to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Prime Minister and me. But the real point is this: what strategy did Labor have to try to stem the decline or turn it around? Nothing. Thirteen years of nothing. No movement. In comes a coalition government and as matter of priority it sits down and says, `Let's put the incentive in place to reverse the decline.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only did this coalition government give incentives to low income earners; this coalition government had the guts to do something that Labor never would: in the budget it gave an incentive for the high income earner to take out private health insurance. We also know, by the way, that the Labor Party would have liked to have done it but, because Paul Keating refused to take out private health insurance, your whole government was stymied on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how ill does it fit in your mouths to be complaining about premium increases? If Labor had been in government, the premiums increases would have continued with no offsetting government response. Now we have an offsetting government response to stem the decline, to turn it around. This is the response which was required by leadership, and that is why we undertook it.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are going forward and implementing that policy. While the focus has been on the government's package, no&hyphen;one should let escape the fact that, whilst we were putting down our policy for industrial relations, the Labor Party was having its policy dictated to it by the ACTU as it was putting down it policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we now know&mdash;and it may seem a long way off but it should not be forgotten&mdash;is that, when we get to the next election, the only party that can upset the continuing implementation of the genuine reform that we have commenced, the only party that can put an alternative, is the Labor Party. I will tell you what their alternative is, because they have been moving these amendments. Their alternative policy for the next election is to scrap sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act to give their mates in the trade union movement a privileged position. You won't believe it, but their policy now is also to bring back Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal law. It makes you the laughing stock of Australian politics for this to be your position. You have moved those amendments in the upper house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are opposed to award simplification, so that means you want awards to be more prescriptive than ever. You want to tie up business with red tape in a way they have never been tied before and from which we are unshackling them in this legislation. You want to put a cap on damages for your mates in the trade union movement&mdash;another classic immunity for your mates in the trade union movement. You would destroy the jobs of young people by abolishing junior wage rates. Finally, we were fascinated that, at the behest of your trade union mates, in the Senate you opposed our disamalgamation provisions&mdash;that I can understand&mdash;and you then opposed altogether any prospect of disamalgamation for any unionists. That can only mean, of course, that if you are ever re&hyphen;elected you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7267"> would give the green light again to the super union process which has been a complete failure for rank and file trade unionists.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate on behalf of the Commonwealth that the settlement of the long running dispute over liability for petroleum resource rent tax on Bass Strait gas production between Victoria, the gas utilities and their suppliers is a great milestone in relation to a long running dispute which has held up much needed reform in the gas industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resolution of the dispute has major economic benefits. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today said `What a gas! Everyone wins!' I indicate that this outcome was negotiated between me and the Victorian Treasurer in relation to the tax aspects over the last two weeks in relation to intensive negotiations. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7268"> would like to thank him, as he has thanked me, for the way in which our teams of officials worked together to resolve this dispute under very difficult circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The essence of the dispute was over the imposition of the resource rent tax. The outcome of the dispute is that approximately $1 billion will be paid to the producers, producing about $620 million in windfall tax to the Commonwealth, $550 million of which will be passed back to the state of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the only part of the settlement. That pass back required an appropriation which the opposition cooperated in passing through the parliament this morning. I thank them for their contribution and I thank them for the cooperation that they showed in relation to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the good thing about this is that it now opens the way for more competition in the gas industry, for new pipelines to be built, for other regulatory barriers to be removed, to join a single market between New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland, and to have the ending of monopoly arrangements where one supplier and one producer had monopoly in a particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hotter competition and more choice will make sure that there are opportunities for consumers, both domestic and industrial, to get cheaper gas. This will help our international competitiveness. This will mean that it will give benefits to Australian business and Australian producers and it will give opportunities to the businesses that rely on gas for their energy supplies to reduce costs. This is a win&hyphen;win&hyphen;win situation&mdash;win for Victoria, win for Esso&hyphen;BHP, win for the Commonwealth but, most of all, a win for business and a win for consumers.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. He is a member who has been very concerned about disadvantaged young people in his electorate and has spoken <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to me on many occasions about them. It is, therefore, entirely understandable that he is interested in the new initiatives of the government to increase opportunities for young people to train for real jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, as a result of the training policies that were put in place by the previous government, employers have been faced over the last 13 years with very substantial bureaucratic hurdles when they have wanted to employ an apprentice or a trainee. The fact that their policies have been dictated largely by the ACTU has meant that many small and medium sized businesses have been very hesitant to take on trainees because they do not want to invite a trade union into a previously non-unionised workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to greatly simplifying the training system and opening opportunities for young people. One of the important initiatives in this regard is going to be the introduction of one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shops, which will streamline the process for employers of hiring an apprentice or a trainee and ensure that employers have ready access to our new flexible and simplified national training arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shops will have under one roof a number of services currently offered by a range of agencies both Commonwealth and state. They will provide a streamlined service in relation to both state and Commonwealth training regulations. They will also help businesses to process new flexible training arrangements and establish accredited on-the-job training and quality off-the-job training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that one of the reasons why the member for Leichhardt has asked me this question is that Australia's first one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shop will be established shortly in his electorate in Cairns. It is an unprecedented agreement between the federal government and the Queensland government to establish three of these one&hyphen;stop shops over the next few months. The Cairns pilot will be a partnership between the CES and the Queensland department of training. It will be sponsored by the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry and it will have a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7271"> board of management comprising industry and government representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government is also negotiating with other state and territory governments to establish further one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shops throughout Australia. The significance of this is that the government has once again delivered on the promise it made during the election campaign to provide training for young people which leads on to real jobs and to ensure that the training arrangements in this country are not those dictated by the ACTU but are those which meet the needs of business, large and small, for training which leads on to greater productivity, greater profitability and more jobs.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the answers to the question are yes, yes, no. But in relation to the speech that was given by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I would like to say a few things. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was obviously floundering and is, obviously, as I have said, not in command of any economic policy on behalf of the opposition. He gets up here and regularly gives us a little economic commentary on figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like his economic commentary which said that our policy could never bring down credit card rates, four days before it did. Like his commentary when he came in here saying that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the monthly unemployment figures would wipe the smile off the face of the government, when jobs increased by 25,000. Like the statement when he came in here and said that consumer confidence was flat, when it leapt eight points off the back of a half a point cut in official interest rates. Whatever he says is going down is going up. Whatever he says is going up is going down. His head is spinning until he comes to a dead end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the company profits, the fact is that company profits rose by 0.3 per cent in the September quarter. They rose. It is true that there was a big decline in the June quarter, but that was before any measures on any basis that the government had put in place could have taken any effect. In relation to the measures we have put in place, of course cuts in official interest rates will kick in next year.</PARA>

We expect the supply and demand to be coming back more into equivalence, and we expect a pick up in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are putting in place changes in relation to interest rates. We have put in place changes in relation to capital gains tax. We are putting in place changes in relation to the provisional tax uplift factor. We are putting in place changes in relation to family tax incentives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we hear from the opposition, as the Minister for Industrial Relations said, is a position from right back when they were in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7272"> the unreconstructed days of Breretonism in relation to industrial relations, from the unreconstructed days of Creanism, and from the doubly unreconstructed days of Fergusonism. That was back in the dinosaur age. When we had our friends in the gallery before, I thought we could have sent the opposition around to talk to them about perestroika. That might have made some difference in relation to your attitude on industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we put in place the measures that are going to turn things around. Of course the biggest thing in relation to the budget was to turn around the legacy of deficit and debt. There is only one way to grow this economy on a sustained basis&mdash;that is, by addressing the two failures of Labor that gave us speed limits in relation to the current account deficit and in relation to inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the measures that you in opposition are opposing. I do not know whether it has dawned on you yet, but you are opposing the measures that can put the Australian economy onto a path of sustainable growth. You, the Labor Party, are opposing them.

On coming to government, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy put some priority action into our structure of the meat industry in Australia.

This is a particular worry because surgeons are just as important in major regional centres as general practitioners are in more remote centres. One of the difficulties has been that surgical training has been largely confined to large city hospitals and there has been no separate rural training program for surgeons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to say that, somewhat due to the work of the member for Murray, I have had a number of meetings now with the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. The college is proposing a new, separate rural training program for surgeons. This is very exciting because it offers the prospect that, for the first time, a young doctor on graduation could go to a country area and do all their training in the country rather than having to go to big city hospitals if they want to specialise. It would mean that, in Victoria, someone could go to Geelong, Shepparton, Moe or Warrnambool, they could sit the first part surgical exam there and then be eligible to be chosen for the surgical training program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The college of surgeons is proposing a new training program that specifically trains people in the needs of rural surgery. Rural surgery is different from city surgery in two respects: one is that rural surgeons need to be trained in obstetrics and the second is that rural surgeons get much more accident and emergency work than a normal general surgeon would. The proposal is to increase surgical training from four years to five years and to have two terms rotating through accident and emergency and through obstetrics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very exciting. It offers the prospect of surgical training over and above existing numbers. It offers the prospect of a specific rural surgical training scheme with the mentoring, with the resources and with the special skills that rural surgeons can provide.

The Prime Minister will be attending that conference in order to press the momentum for trade liberalisation within APEC and globally&mdash;the matter he discussed with President Clinton yesterday. The Prime Minister proposed at a meeting in Sydney on 1 August that APEC examine the idea of free trade in primary energy before APEC's 2010 and 2020 target dates, and perhaps by the year 2000. This was because the reliable and efficient provision of energy was fundamental to economic growth in the region. It was estimated that removing tariff measures by 2000 in primary energy would increase APEC's real GDP by around $4.5 billion annually. As a major energy exporter, Australia would stand to share in these benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The history of the register of lobbyists goes back quite some time. It was established by the Hawke government following the Combe-Ivanov affair. It applied only to a narrow class of lobbyists defined as `a person or company who, for financial or other advantage, represented a client in dealings with government ministers or officials', but, frankly, it was a toothless tiger and its provisions were really unenforceable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some evidence that the requirements of the scheme were just not being adhered to. In 1993, 1994 and 1995, only eight inquiries were made with the register of lobbyists. There has also been quite a bit of criticism that the register was not available for public scrutiny and that the scheme was an unnecessary hindrance to the business sector. I believe that the need for the register has been overtaken by general changes to the government processes, particularly in light of the active roles taken by the ministers of this government to ensure that their relevant community and business interests are consulted in the decision making process. There will be a revision to the guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility. It is to be amended next year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday, the member for Oxley asked me a question in my role as Minister representing the Minister for Social Security in this House about the provision of special benefits for newly arrived migrants. I am now able to provide some additional information that might help on that subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Newly arrived migrants who have been in Australia for fewer than 26 weeks and are therefore unable to receive unemployment payments may be eligible for a special benefit if they meet the strict hardship and income tests for that payment. Since 1 April 1996, the hardship test has included the requirement that new migrants must have suffered a significant change in circumstances for reasons beyond their control since arriving in Australia. As at September 1996, 227 migrants were receiving special benefit, because the existing 26-week newly arrived residents waiting period precluded them from jobsearch, newstart, youth training or sickness allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not possible to provide a figure on the value of the special benefit paid to new migrants. Special benefit is paid at a discretionary rate which cannot exceed the maximum rate of newstart allowance, which is currently paid at $320.20 per fortnight for a single person over 21 years. Special benefit is reduced by $1 for each dollar of income earned. The rate is also reduced for any in kind support; for example, if the person receives free board and/or lodging.</PARA></QUESTION></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the House. On Sunday of last week Senator Liam Naughten, the President of the Irish Senate, tragically died in a car accident in Ireland. Senator Naughten was aged 52 and was elected firstly to the House of Representatives in Ireland in 1981.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was known throughout this period in parliament as being a very fair man. He came from the west coast of Ireland. He had a great interest as a farmer in all matters relating to the land. My own family, who still have very small&mdash;I assure all honourable members on the other side&mdash;holdings on the west coast of Ireland, benefited from the representation that the deceased senator made on behalf of the farmers of Ireland.

But we always left in what has been the time&hyphen;honoured point in the week when backbench members on both sides of the House represent to the parliament in traditional form the grievances of the people in their electorates.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further point that I would draw the House's attention to is that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, was only advised last evening, well after the address by President Clinton, that this matter was urgent in that it required to meet the deadline of today. This is despite the fact the issue was on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> in the Senate on 11 October.</PARA>

I hope he is coming into the chamber for the debate because we always like to hear his contributions, and we would like him to respond to some of the points that we are going to raise today about the way this government has turned health policy into a complete shambles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to remember that this is the minister who claimed that he was absolutely on top of everything, that he was on top of every detail and every scrap of information in his portfolio responsibilities. But this is the minister who said that he was not aware of the MBF press release. In fact, we saw it being handed to him during question time. He claims to be on top of everything but he has to have someone hand him a copy of the MBF press release. Then he cannot even quote from it accurately without misleading the parliament. Then he admits that he has approved increases of up to 15 per cent for this health fund, but he does not know who will be affected. It must be very difficult to be absolutely on top of everything, but to not know about the press release announcing it, to not know whether he has misled the parliament or to not know what the arrangements are for that particular health fund, the fact is that health policy under this government and health policy under this minister is a shambles.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the two largest private health funds increasing their premiums by up to 15 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent, we have federal funding for public hospitals being cut back yet again, and today is the third national day of action by young doctors who are on strike or who are protesting about this government's unfair and retrospective legislation on Medicare provider numbers. So that is the reason we raise this matter of public importance today. That is the reason we are trying to give the minister a chance to come and defend himself in the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can only hope that the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) is going to take up the challenge for the honourable member and perhaps speak in defence of his close colleague Dr Wooldridge, the person whom we all know he would like to replace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me start with the issue of health insurance. For the 13 years when they were in opposition, they always had only two policies for health: the first policy was to abolish Medicare and the second policy was to give rebates for health insurance. They were the only two ideas you had in opposition: abolish Medicare and give tax rebates for private health insurance. After a couple of election losses, they had to ditch the first promise of the claim that they were going to abolish Medicare. In the background of course, as we all know, decision after decision in this budget undermines Medicare. Publicly, they are saying that they have ditched that first philosophy. They have ditched the claim that they are going to abolish Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing, the only thing, they were left with at the 1996 election was this great idea of giving tax breaks for private health insurance. That was going to be the miracle solution to every problem that we have in the health service today. It was going to increase the number of people who would take out private health insurance. It was going to reduce the pressure on our public hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we find is that, not even six months before the tax rebate starts to get paid, most of that rebate has been swallowed up in higher premiums. They have spent $1.7 billion and they have got nothing for it. There is nothing to show for it. There certainly is not an increase in the number of people who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7283"> have taken out private health insurance and there is no evidence at all that there is any pressure being taken off our public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first mistake that this government and this minister made was that, when they decided to provide this tax break of $1.7 billion to the industry, they did not seek any assurances from the private health funds that they would moderate their premium increases. You would have thought that if the government really believed that this tax rebate would solve all the problems in health insurance from 1 July next year, they would have brought in all the health funds, sat them down at the table and asked them for some form of assurance that they would not be jacking up their premiums to steal back that health rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What in fact happened? They announced in the budget that they are locked into giving out this $1.7 billion tax break, yet they had no assurances at all from the industry. Imagine if the government believed that it was good for the nation to buy more steel and offered anyone who bought steel a tax rebate. Imagine if they offered us $1.7 billion worth of tax rebates if we bought more steel stakes and more sheet steel.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HOLLIS" NAMEID="DH4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the member representing Illawarra is a strong supporter of such a policy. The point is: before you give BHP and all the people involved in the steel industry a $1.7 billion tax break, wouldn't you pick up the phone and ring BHP and ask John Prescott if he would agree to moderate his prices for steel so that he would not try to snatch back the $1.7 billion?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what has happened. The government could not be bothered to sit down with the health funds to get some assurances from them about what would happen with increases. What we have seen as a result is that funds are snatching back the benefits that have flowed from this tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we find is that every time these increases take place the government goes into panic mode. Back in August, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who has to be seen to be doing something, decided that in future he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would personally consider, vet and ultimately approve every application for increase.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the member for Hunter was hopeful that that might make a difference. But what have we seen? Back in August the Prime Minister blamed a junior official in the Department of Health and Family Services for approving six per cent increases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening now? The Prime Minister is approving 12 per cent or 15 per cent increases. So it is okay for the Prime Minister to attack a junior official in the department of health for approving six per cent increases, but when the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the minister for health approve increases of double the size there is no blame associated with him. He was forced to do it. But it was okay for the Prime Minister to attack a junior official in the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the House that, back in August when the Prime Minister intervened, he announced an inquiry which is currently being undertaken by the Productivity Commission. It will report in February. The Prime Minister was asked what would happen to further applications that might be lodged by funds before next February. The Prime Minister's response was, `Well, we'll be disappointed if any funds apply.' He said, `The government would look askance at any applications.' So there is the signal. According to the Prime Minister, not only would they be tough on any future application, but they would also discourage anyone from lodging any more applications between now and February. That is what he said in August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has actually happened? The government's own health fund, Medibank Private, has been approved quite a substantial increase. They say that that is an average of almost 13 per cent, with increases of up to 15 per cent. When the government's own health fund ignores the Prime Minister's plea, that is pretty bad. But when the Prime Minister ignores his own plea for restraint then that is even worse. When the Prime Minister, John Howard, ignores John Howard's request for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7284"> moderation on health insurance increases, something is very wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for health summed it up accurately a month or so ago when he appeared on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>. In a moment of honesty, he admitted that this was as much about perceptions as it was about reality. That was the admission that the Prime Minister's intervention back in August was nothing but a publicity stunt. The Prime Minister's intervention in August has actually seen, since he has been personally responsible for health insurance fund increases, a doubling of the size of the applications, a doubling of the size of the increases. It was nothing but an attempt to manipulate perceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Question time today was very interesting. We had the minister appear on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program this morning for a few minutes and make three mistakes. He got caught out here today at question time. The first mistake he made was that he claimed that the government had in some way beaten down MBF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did MBF say in their press release, which was released, by coincidence, yesterday&mdash;virtually while the President of the United States was addressing this chamber? The MBF announced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A notification of contribution rate changes as originally submitted by the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia (MBF), which represents the health funding needs of more than 1.3 million Australians, has been approved by the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA>This was as originally submitted by MBF and approved by the government. There is obviously someone not telling the truth here. Is it MBF or is it the Minister for Health and Family Services?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also remind the minister that he said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> this morning that the average increase for MBF is 6.5 per cent. When we ask him whether he stands by that, whether he is prepared to mislead this House the way he misled the listeners of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> this morning&mdash;not deliberately, I am sure&mdash;he repeats part of a quote. He quoted quite selectively the rise in contribution rates of 6.5 per cent across the fund's membership overall, but what he did not tell honourable members is that the rest of the sentence said that we get that figure of 6.5 per cent by shoving 300,000 contributors into <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> excess policies. It is like saying that, yes, the price of a Commodore has gone up 15 per cent but you can get a Barina at a cheaper price. If you take up a product which is of lesser value or with a larger excess, of course you would expect the price to be cheaper. That is the way this minister has misled this House and the listeners of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He might be back in the cone of silence, but the point I want to make is that this $1.7 billion tax break is being swallowed up by increases in premiums that this government is approving. To pay for that $1.7 bill <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7285"> ion tax break for private health insurance, what has happened? The  government have cut federal funding for public hospitals by $800 million, they have abolished the Commonwealth dental health program&mdash;that is $400 million worth&mdash;and they have increased the cost of essential pharmaceuticals by $500 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is what has paid for this tax break for the industry: less money for public hospitals, less money for essential dental services and an increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals. That is what the government has had to do&mdash;not because of some deficit but because it had not funded its election promises. With the government having spent that $1.7 billion for no benefit whatsoever, we now have to ask ourselves: to improve the quality of health care of Australians, wouldn't it have been better to have spent that $1.7 billion in improving public hospitals by giving them extra money?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure the House that, whatever decisions this government might wish to take in relation to this area, the minister has been exposed this afternoon for misleading this House. He must be the only person in Australia who thinks it is good news when Australia's two largest health funds increase their rates by up to 15 per cent, he must be the only person in Australia who thinks that in some way we can provide better health care to Australians by cutting federal funding for public hospitals and he must be the only Liberal minister for health who has so quickly managed to have gotten so many doctors and so many organisations offside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is no wonder that the minister is not prepared to appear in the House to defend his reputation. We can assure him that the questions will continue and that we will ensure that he continues to be accountable for this shambles of a health policy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been interesting to listen to the shadow spokesman for health, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee). He has been handed what could be considered a dream portfolio in opposition. Health is a dream portfolio. And do honourable members know what? He is going to blow it. He is blowing it because he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> does not understand it. It is an enormously complex area. The demands in health are great and competitive. It is very interesting that he was there for most of the past 13 years of the failed Keating and Hawke governments. During that period, private health cover membership dropped from 65 per cent to 33.6 per cent of Australians, and it was actually the direct actions of the Hawke and Keating governments which contributed during that period to a 39 per cent increase in health premiums.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell has mentioned three areas in this MPI. He has dealt with private health insurance and has looked at the funding of public hospitals and the restriction of provider numbers for medical students and current interns. I will deal with each of those in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to see the ALP now coming in here as the defenders of private health insurance. It is very interesting to see the ALP now coming in here concerned about the fact that all these people who hold private health insurance will have their incentives supposedly gobbled up by the premium increases.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TK6">Dr SOUTHCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about the battlers? This is directed at low and middle income earners. It is very important to separate the issue of private health insurance incentives which are being offered to low and middle earners from the issue of insurance premium rises. They are separate issues. As the opposition spokesman for health understands very well, during the Hawke and Keating governments 174 requests for premium increases were made by health funds. How many did they reject? Not one. They did not reject one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) has not stayed to hear my contribution, but her former boss, Brian Howe, when he was health minister during 1991-92&mdash;he is a fellow traveller of the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese)&mdash;oversaw a 17 per cent increase on average in private health funds. That was at about the same time that he managed to walk into a broom closet at the end of a press <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7286"> conference during the dying days of the Hawke government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been estimated that a two per cent drop in private health cover costs this nation the equivalent of 325,000 bed days. That is also the equivalent of two teaching hospitals. As I said before, the Hawke and Keating governments oversaw a decline in private health insurance of the order of 30 per cent. That is the equivalent of 30 teaching hospitals around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the member for Dobell, the ALP's spokesman on health, has not even bothered to stay and listen to this debate. He is not even concerned about the real issues which face Australians in the health area. We are interested in addressing the issue of cost shifting, which is a rort and which he defends. We are interested in preventive health measures. We are interested in giving people some relief for holding private health cover and trying to increase those rates of private health cover so that there is not such an incredible demand on the public system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor contributed to that decline in private health insurance by such initiatives as changing the Medicare rebate from 85 to 75 per cent. They removed the reinsurance pool and they totally neglected to address the issue of cost shifting. In fact, back in August, the shadow minister did not even understand what cost shifting was. He had no idea that it was so complex. The ALP also removed the Commonwealth bed day subsidy. All of those actions by the previous government contributed to a 39 per cent increase in premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About five million Australians will be eligible for private health insurance tax incentives. It is important to emphasise, especially to those 700,000 Australians whose incomes are below $20,000 but who have been holding private insurance, that this incentive will be available as a tax rebate, but it will also be available as an equivalent amount by way of a reduced premium cost for those who do not pay enough tax. So for pensioners and others who are earning less than $20,000 a year and who hold private health insurance, it does not matter if they do not pay tax, they will be eligible; they will just pay a reduced premium.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be remembered that Labor had a few health ministers during its period in office. Carmen Lawrence's health legislation did nothing to address the haemorrhaging that was going on in private health insurance. Looking at the issue of cost shifting, if the shadow minister is concerned about cost shifting, which we have addressed, he is in a sense defending a rort. There are plenty of visible signs of this rort. In a Melbourne public hospital, there is a bulk&hyphen;billing Medicare clinic which specialises in things like plaster cast removal. That is a direct shifting of cost from what should be a state responsibility to the Commonwealth government. In another Melbourne hospital, there are 62 privatised outpatient clinics. This is all quite contrary to the Medicare agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Health ministers agreed at their June 1995 meeting in Alice Springs to recover annually the growth that was occurring in cost shifting in that period. That is all we have done. The member for Dobell refers to decreases in funding to public hospitals. It relates to addressing this whole issue of cost shifting. I would like to refer to a few quotes. Here is one:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as the Labor Party had always been a bit biased against private health insurance. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was said by a former health minister in the Keating government, Graham Richardson. It is interesting to note that Paul Keating, in the 1993 election campaign, said that people did not need private health insurance, that Medicare would be enough. Richardson went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was never comfortable with the thought of wealthy people elbowing battlers out of queues in public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the situation that occurred under the Labor government. The member for Grayndler talks about battlers. While he was never a fellow traveller of Graham Richardson, Graham Richardson went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even the thought that the Liberals are prepared to make the rich pay more when the Labor Party would not is enough to scare the hell out of me.</PARA>
<PARA>If they are so concerned about private health insurance and people not being in the system, why is it that they never addressed this issue? Richardson went on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7287">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there were those in the party who thought any suggestion that public hospitals were not being adequately funded amounted either to cowardice in being unable to face up to funding cuts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that would be members of the Right like the member for Dobell&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or treason for daring to suggest anything could be wrong with Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA>That would be members of the Left like the member for Grayndler. Finally, I would like to speak on the issue of the restriction of Medicare provider numbers. There is no doubt this was a tough decision. It was tough on interns and it was tough on current medical students. It was based on the premise that each doctor who goes onto the Medicare benefits schedule adds something like $175,000 to $225,000 through consultations, pharmaceuticals, radiology and pathology services. The OECD has estimated that at least 55 per cent of health care costs are supply driven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a difficult decision. We have looked at a number of areas. We are actually addressing the area of reducing medical school intakes. We are making it more difficult for overseas trained doctors to practise in Australia by imposing a 10&hyphen;year moratorium on those doctors practising. That will apply after 1 January 1997. In a previous speech on the bill which related to this issue, the ALP spokesman for health said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Party certainly understands the importance of seeking to manage the medical work force. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He is so right there, because it is very interesting to look at what has been said on this issue by health ministers in the previous government. First of all, before this proposal had even been floated, this year in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Doctor</EMPHASIS> , Brian Howe said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Restricting provider numbers should be considered to limit the general practice workforce.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . perhaps provider numbers could control the numbers of GPs.</PARA>
<PARA>What did the health minister after him, Graham Richardson, say about it? In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>  of October 1996 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope Michael Wooldridge, the Federal Minister for Health, stands his ground and limits Medicare <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provider numbers for new medical graduates from November.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMA was told in 1993 that restrictions on Medicare provider numbers were inevitable. I told the AMA that this would happen, regardless of who governed Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Last of all, the senior general practice adviser of the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), the last health minister in the Keating government, confirmed that they had sought legal advice which indicated that it was possible to restrict access to provider numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well for the ALP to come in here and say that this is a terrible thing the government is doing. We know it is a tough thing. All members on this side of this House know that it is a tough thing. The problem has been that, in order to keep Medicare going, we had to address some of the uncontrolled increases in cost that have occurred in Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, I believe that most medical graduates will be able to get work after this measure is introduced. There will be 400 places for general practitioners and, as of next year, there will be 760 specialty posts available. The increase in specialty posts has been due to an expansion in positions in ENT, orthopaedics, anaesthetics and urology. There will also be positions for 20 doctors to go into medical administration and 20 doctors to go into medical research. Next year, rather than 400 general practice training positions, it will be 420. This year, overseas trained doctors had 89 places. When you put that altogether, the number of Australian graduates being approximately 1,200 and 89 overseas trained doctors getting places, it means that almost every Australian graduate&mdash;and not all of them will want to go on to practise medicine&mdash;will be able to get a training position which will allow them to be better trained before they go onto the Medicare scheme.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I intend to begin by addressing the massive cuts to public hospital funding announced this week, cuts which back up the cuts that were announced in the budget. These cuts are an attack on the Medicare system and public hospitals. They have a bad impact on doctors, nurses and health care workers. But, most importantly, at the end of the day they will have a devastating impact on patients in the public hospital system. There are $75 million worth of cuts&mdash;$34 million in New South Wales, $24 million in Victoria, $9 million in Western Australia, $5 million in Queensland and $3 million in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amounts, in conjunction with the budget cuts, to the largest federal cut to public hospitals since the beginning of Medicare. There has been no consultation with governments about this latest round, just letters to the state health departments letting them know that the cuts would start from this week&mdash;cuts that will mean, in a state such as New South Wales, something in the order of $700,000 out of the system per week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He changed his mind. He went to the election and he made a series of promises.

That is why the Minister for Health and Family Services is not even bothering to be in this House to defend his handling of this portfolio. He is embarrassed by the performance of this government on health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These latest cuts to health are just more in a series that the coalition has introduced since the election, further proof that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services do not consider providing Australians with a decent, fair and accessible health system is important. These are more cutbacks to a system that is already suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are cutbacks in federal funding for public hospitals of $800 million, cutbacks to the dental health program of $400 million and cutbacks to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme of $500 million. And what does that add up to? To $1.7 billion, exactly the handout that is being given to the private insurers in their so&hyphen;called scheme. On top of that, we are also seeing cutbacks to special purpose programs, like specialist health programs for women and men, mental health programs&mdash;cutbacks right across the board. These cuts will have massive impacts on the health care system in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give an indication of that impact, let us take a look at what the latest round of cuts will mean in a state like New South Wales, a state where the Minister for Health, Dr Refshauge, has not rolled over. He has been defending the public health system. Indeed, in the next financial year, funding in the New South Wales system will be increased by $632 million. In spite of the cuts coming from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7289"> this federal government, there will be a $632 million increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In real terms, this latest round will mean that over 900 medical and nursing employees will face the loss of their jobs, with another 160 support staff positions to go. Some 400 hospital beds will be closed and an incredible 17,000 fewer patients will be able to be treated in the public hospital system causing severely increased delays for elective surgery and longer delays in emergency departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mates of the government over here in the New South Wales parliament are talking about increasing the funding in the health system in New South Wales at the same time as the federal government is making further cuts. It is quite clear that the public health system in this country needs increased funding, not massive reductions. That is why the Carr government in New South Wales has done that, in spite of the role of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is rather ironic that we have a health minister here who is perhaps the only doctor in the country who thinks that it is acceptable for public hospitals to get less funds. It is abundantly clear to anyone who has ever set foot in a public hospital emergency department that the health professionals and support staff are already working incredibly hard, under immense pressure, to provide a quality service to their patients. Members will recall yesterday's comments of the Australian of the Year, Dr John Yu. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public hospitals, hospitals like mine, look after the Australian battler.</PARA>
<PARA>Remember them&mdash;the Australian battlers? He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Private hospitals look after people who can look after themselves, but we worry about those who can't.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the Australian of the Year talking about children and about the latest round of cuts from this uncaring, selfish government. Staff at his hospital, the Sydney Children's Hospital at Westmead, work so hard because they are helping families in need. It is a shame that the coalition is not working as hard as they are on supporting those workers and improving the system they work in. Given a choice of Dr Yu on the one hand and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the minister for health on the other, I know whose side I am on. I am on the side of the Australian battlers, just like Dr John Yu.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem for this government is that they cannot get over their obsessive hatred of the public sector. It does not matter whether it be public housing, the federal Public Service, the ABC or federally funded child care because, if it is public, they will try to decimate it. At the same time, the coalition seem to be pretty generous to their mates in the private sector. The shadow minister has pointed that out today with their approval of the 15 per cent rise in fees for MBF and Medibank Private, the government's own fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These increases will hit the three million contributors in these funds very hard indeed. It makes a mockery of the coalition's election promises on tax rebates for private health insurance when millions of Australians would have lost more than half of that rebate already in premium increases. And that is just since March! They do not get the rebate until July next year, but they have already lost it. The last round of premium increases in August have already been hurting people in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the minister say? He says, `It's not 15 per cent. They can just downgrade the sort of insurance they take out.' And he accuses us of being the attackers of private health insurance! He says, `You can just downgrade. Go for the cheaper model.' What is that if not an attack on those who take out private health insurance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rather pathetic replacement&mdash;the substitute for a minister over there&mdash;raised a question of the former minister Graham Richardson and his proposal. He did propose a levy on higher income earners, but he said that you had to put the money back into the public health system. You had to do it&mdash;something that you people have not done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude with this: I have battlers in my electorate coming to see me. I had a phone call from a constituent called Rita Holden today, a pensioner in Marrickville, talking about the hardships that these increases would bring. They are the sort of people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7290"> this will impact, not the holders of unit trusts that we see over there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time that these increases were being announced, the President of the United States was addressing this chamber. How ironic, given that Hillary Clinton asked for a briefing on the public health system in Australia&mdash;the best in the Western world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor came to power in 1983. At that time, membership in private health insurance in Australia was 63.7 per cent of the population. In Western Australia, membership was 62.2 per cent of the population. In March this year, when Labor lost and after they had presided over this travesty, membership in Australia was down to 33.9 per cent and, in Western Australia, it was down to 36.8 per cent.</PARA>

If Geoff Gallop is elected Premier of Western Australia, he will treat the health system with the same neglect that the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell honourable members that it is only in recent times that I have got over shuddering at the title of `Minister for Health'. It is only since the present Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, has taken over that role that I have had some confidence in a minister for health. When the member for Fremantle was in that position, my flesh would crawl every time you mentioned the title `Minister for Health'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is a woman who was the Premier of Western Australia but who sold the state down the gurgler through the WA Inc. years and who was a disgrace as the minister for health. She was a disgrace to the women of Western Australia. She sold western women short, and I cannot imagine how opposition members can sit there with her still on their frontbench. Most people would be too ashamed and would not have the gall to have her in any position whatsoever. Having spoken privately to Labor members of this parliament, I know that she is a complete embarrassment to you. The sooner she goes the better for Labor, Western Australia and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government in Western Australia, when Geoff Gallop and Carmen Lawrence were in power, did nothing to encourage the federal Labor government to stop the flow of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7291"> members out of private health insurance. They did nothing. They assisted in the destruction of our health system and they pretty damn well destroyed it totally.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fall in membership of private health insurance threatens the stability of the entire health care system. Despite that, Labor sat back and did absolutely nothing about it. They provided no encouragement for people to stay in private health insurance. To have the then Prime Minister of the country bragging about the fact that he was not in private health insurance used to just absolutely amaze me, but of course the man was loaded. With his piggeries and what have you, he could afford to get himself into the luxury hospitals whenever he wanted to. Labor sat back and did nothing through all those years. They came in here bleating about a premium increase when they did nothing over the 174 premium increases.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pain inflicted on the health of millions of Australians resulting from private health fund premiums rising by up to 15 per cent. . .</PARA>
<PARA>What about the pain of the 174 increases inflicted by your mob when you were sending the health system down the gurgler? What a gall. The 174 increases. What did you do about that? What did you do about the decline in the number of members going into private health insurance? You did nothing. Absolutely nothing. It is forever to your shame that you did absolutely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time that you opposite understood that the health system that we preside over is not perfect, but we are going to be doing our best to fix up the mess that you left. I think the Australian people told you exactly what they thought of the way you had managed Australia by the way they voted in March. In Lindsay&mdash;isn't it glorious to see Jackie Kelly back?&mdash;the Australian people underlined what they thought of your management of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's public hospital system is in overload. We need to encourage as many people as possible to ensure that they have access to the full range of health care services, both public and private, and we are doing that. We are doing what Labor was too politically bankrupt to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of things I would like to mention. One is the health ministers under Labor. Let us look at them&mdash;and what a rogues' gallery, if you don't mind. Neal Blewett: he started Medicare, but made no provisions for a balanced health care system by encouraging people to remain in private health insurance. Brian Howe: he did nothing, but when he retired&mdash;it is amazing how you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7292"> lot get brave when you retire&mdash;he said that he should have done something. Graham Richardson: he did nothing but, during the election, he said, `Something should have been done.' He had plenty of time to do something, but he did nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And as for the member for Fremantle, Carmen Lawrence. My God, this embarrassment of Australian politics. One of the reasons why I think politicians have a rotten reputation is the member for Fremantle. She probably forgot what she was the minister for. She is a disgrace to the Australian parliament. She should never have been a minister. She should never have been the health minister. I will quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 15 November last year.

<PARA>This motion is intended to grant a request conveyed to the House in the letter tabled by the Speaker on Tuesday. The letter is from Arthur Robinson &amp; Hedderwicks, solicitors, and seeks permission of the House to adduce in evidence certain extracts from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . The request concerns a speech on the Racial Hatred Bill 1994.

These are the proceedings listed in the notice of motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion itself does not address the substantive issue of privilege itself. That is a matter governed by the law as expounded in section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. The well-known immunity of parliamentary proceedings from being impeached or questioned in court is inherited from article 9 of the Bill of Rights; however, subsection 16(5) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act does in fact state that neither the 1987 act nor the Bill of Rights is taken to prevent the admission of parliamentary records in connection <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with a matter arising under section 57 of the constitution or the interpretation of an act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there is some judicial authority for the view that the permission of the House is not required on the procedural question of actual production of the parliamentary records, as distinct from the substantive question of the use to which they can be put, the House has never formally abandoned the position that permission should be sought&mdash;hence, today's motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of precedents for permission being granted.

<TIME.STAMP>(4.28 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had commenced my remarks about the Import Processing Charges Bill 1996 before question time intervened. I was dealing with the responsibilities of the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) for Customs. I was making the observation that, apart from this bill, putting up charges for the use of customs as well as increasing red tape for small business was against the background of some very significant cuts to the Customs Service, thereby restricting its ability to perform its duties. Those cuts total $70 million over the next four years, the loss of 105 jobs in Victoria, 65 in New South Wales, 60 in the ACT, 25 in Queensland and 24 in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that, on the one hand, is saying it will increase employment but, on the other, is taking deliberate steps that indeed cut it back. The government has also introduced a complete ending of all airport shift work. This is a very interesting decision by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs in relation to his own department, because it comes from a minister who, before he was the minister and when in opposition, told his colleagues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any budgetary cuts to [customs inspection and clearance procedures] would slow down the clearance of goods, holding up businesses, and result in a lesser frequency of inspections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Budget cuts would also result in a decline in the number of audits undertaken and hence revenue raised . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any decline in the intelligence activities will impact on Customs' law enforcement activities and, in particular, their success.</PARA>
<PARA>You have not only the impact in terms of businesses wanting to get access to their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> goods and that being held up but also the minister admitting before he implemented these decisions that they would hamper the ability of the Customs Service to carry out its own activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The minister has also presided over a $400 million cut to the diesel fuel rebate. Presumably, this cut came about because they claimed there were $400 million of rorters in the scheme. What the government claimed in advance of the diesel fuel rebate decision, in saying that they had kept their election promise, was they would not cut the rebate except in cases of abuse of the system. The minister is really saying to the farmers and the miners of this country, `We kept the diesel fuel rebate but, really, it is $400 million less. The reason it is $400 million less is that you are rorting the scheme.' This is the stock defence by the government to a lot of the cuts that they have imposed. Rather than enter the dialogue and the debate about these things, they simply assert the fact that there has been a rort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Turning to the minister's responsibility in the small business side of his portfolio, the minister recently released the Charlie Bell review of small business red tape. This was another of the election promises of the government. Interestingly enough, when this report was released, it was not tabled in this parliament. So we have not been able to gain access to copies of this report in the normal way that one would expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) had his office ring the minister's office to get a copy of the report. The person ringing on behalf of the member for Shortland was asked which party the member was from. When they said it was for the ALP, they were told, `You've got to go to the government bookshop.' In other words, what we have here is a government that is so into openness, accountability, improved understanding and improved information that it will only release its report to its mates&mdash;having accused us of being in the mates' brigade&mdash;and, so far as the Labor Party is concerned, we have to pay for the privilege. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7295">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is hardly what you would call an even-handed approach in government, but it is the way in which the minister operates in relation to his portfolio. I think it is in keeping with the way in which he operates his private businesses about which we have already demonstrated there are so many appearances of conflict of interest that they have become legion. Yet his view on all of these things is to deny either responsibility or conflict, or both, and say that so far as he is concerned he will keep it all to himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Charlie Bell review was about finding ways of meeting the Prime Minister's commitment to cut small business red tape by 50 per cent over the term of the government, which was a promise reconfirmed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as recently as last month. The Charlie Bell report has, in effect, set a benchmark for this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know the government itself does not like setting benchmarks. It will not set a target for the unemployed, it will not set a target for employment growth, it will not reaffirm targets in important areas of economic activity; but it is prepared, in election promise terms, to set a target of cutting red tape by 50 per cent. Let us understand the importance of that: targets for people do not matter but targets for paper do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we ask, `What does the 50 per cent target reduction mean?' they sort of go mute. They say, `We have got a commitment of 50 per cent over the term of the government.' What is revealing in this report is the ability to measure and benchmark that target. It stated in the report that the average small business spends four hours a week on government red tape&mdash;translated, the promise is to cut red tape to two hours. Labor will be keeping a close eye on whether the government does in fact keep to that promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I see that the minister is not even here in the House. He was not in the House when this debate was on just before question time and he is still not here. No doubt he is looking after the affairs of his private companies. They are more important than the matters before parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has made a dreadful start in cutting red tape. As these bills show, one of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the minister's first acts is to increase tax. Remember the promises made before the election, `No increase in taxes under a Liberal government.' Read my lips, honest John: no increase in taxes. This is what this bill does. Don't you think that a charge imposed on businesses that have to use the services to get their goods constitutes a charge or a tax? That is what he has put up. He runs around the country promising to cut red tape and not put taxes up; yet this is a bill that increases taxes as well as increasing the red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package comprises three bills which the Deputy Speaker has indicated we are dealing with cognately. They give legislative authority for the measures announced in the budget to introduce full cost recovery for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service. It involves the imposition of 13 fees and charges&mdash;in other words, taxes. This is a broken promise&mdash;obviously not a core promise&mdash;and this is a government committed to helping small business. The new taxes will apply from 1 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the bills will not be opposed by Labor because they do expand the user&hyphen;pays arrangements for Customs begun when we were in office. They apply only to imports and they are levied either on the importer or the shipper. But the opposition does have some major concerns with the impact the bills will have on small businesses and in some regions. We will therefore be moving a series of amendments in the Senate to protect the people whose livelihoods are threatened by aspects of these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, Labor is concerned that the bills will lead to extra costs for imports of materials used in manufacturing here in Australia at a time when business incentive measures are being stripped away all through the budget. What the charges will do is also have a greater impact on regional ports where Customs have closed their offices and may impact negatively on regional ports such as Geelong. The measures will also increase small business red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims they have consulted widely with industry on the introduction of these charges. This appears mainly to have occurred within the confines of the Customs <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7296"> National Consultative Committee. The intention of Labor is therefore to move amendments as I will outline. The first is a four&hyphen;year phase&hyphen;in period for the reduction threshold at which the import entry charge is levied from $1,000 to $250. As it stands now in the proposal, the reduction in the threshold may have a substantial impact on small importers who supply niche markets with specialised product from overseas and to low volume importers, typically small business. The immediate imposition of the lower threshold could drive such firms out of business by imposing the extra $22.80 charge for electronic entries or $44.55 for manual entries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we will be moving an amendment for a four&hyphen;year phase&hyphen;in period for the new fees. This is particularly important for fees on manual entry which are to be levied at a much higher level than the fees on electronic entry. What this does is threaten disproportionately small businesses which do not have access to the electronic facilities or which lack the expertise to utilise the service. While Customs' advice is that they plan to increase access to electronic entering by installing computers at Customs shopfronts, airports, international mail exchanges and customs houses, where many small commercial importers currently lodge their manual claims, these facilities will not be in place on 1 January when the high fees are proposed to be applicable. It therefore seems reasonable that a phase&hyphen;in period apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, in respect of the licensing charge for section 17B premises, we will seek to introduce a two&hyphen;tiered fee based on the turnover of the individual premises. This will help protect premises and jobs based in regional Australia where the turnover may be lower but the service is no less important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So whilst not opposing the overall thrust of this bill we do want to highlight the concerns that we have. The first is with the way the minister has been administering his portfolio&mdash;the very fact that he is still not in the chamber is evidence of his neglect and the contempt in which he holds this important piece of work. The second is with the fact that we see inherent in this bill a breach yet again of election commitments on two <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fronts&mdash;first, that it does involve an increase in taxes on small businesses and, second, that it adds to the paperwork that businesses will have to undertake&mdash;and the third is in relation to the specific detail of the bill. We think the decision to implement and move completely to full cost recovery on 1 January is not appropriate. For that reason we will be supporting amendments which seek to provide a phase&hyphen;in for the measures sought.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) for 20 minutes of his half hour spoke about the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser). He devoted only his last 10 minutes to the Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. In my remarks I will devote my total time to remarks on the bill. This bill is one of the three bills designed to implement cost recovery for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service. The three bills in this legislative package provide for the imposition and collection of 13 charges and fees on import related services. The 13 imposts are located in three pieces of legislation, two new charges bills&mdash;the Import Processing Charges Bill and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill&mdash;as well as the Customs Amendment Bill. These bills will result in full cost recovery for commercial customs activities directly and indirectly required to process imports. This was among the measures announced by the government in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1 January 1997 the Australian Customs Service will apply full cost recovery for all commercial customs activities directly and indirectly required to process imports. The services to be covered by the new charges are cargo reporting, both sea and air, import entry processing&mdash;sea, air and post&mdash;and licensing of approved places for the examination of goods. This measure forecasts a net budget impact of $45.9 million per annum. This represents $66.5 million less the $18.5 million currently collected for the use of IT facilities. To coincide with this measure, Customs has taken the opportunity to streamline refund procedures and associated cost recovery, and adjust current charges for out of hours work <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7297"> or work by customs officers in locations where they do not usually work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Charges have been determined from a detailed activity based costing of customs services. The costing methodology has been reviewed by external auditors. The charges are limited to the calculated costs of delivering the functions and will be reviewed annually to ensure that they reflect only the costing structure. Costs to process import transactions by Customs will be examined annually and any material changes will be reflected in an annual review of the charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before outlining the industry impact of these changes, I would like to draw attention to the industry consultation which took place after the budget. After the budget announcement, members of the Customs National Consultative Committee, the CNCC, were briefed at a special meeting about the nature of the proposed charges. This committee comprises representatives from the Australian Air Transport Association, the Australian Chamber of Shipping, the Australian Federation of International Forwarders, the Customs Brokers Council of Australia&mdash;CBCA&mdash;the International Air Couriers Association, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Law Council of Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their feedback resulted in some changes being made to the charges for entry processing and the methods of collection. This committee met again in September where the charges were once more the subject of discussion. Meetings have been held with various sectors of the importing community, such as the air express couriers and the cargo terminal operators, in regard to establishing the most efficient collection methods for the charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In meeting with a variety of industry sectors, Customs was made aware of some difficulties that the collection of cargo reporting fees and screening fees would impose on cargo terminal operators and shipping companies for manual reporting charges and on air express couriers for screening charges. Special arrangements may be entered into for the collection of the charges, including periodic settlement arrangements to coincide with the operating environment and billing cycles <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> experienced by many of the firms in the importing community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to meetings, Customs has conducted a series of industry briefing sessions in all state and territory capital cities and in several regional centres. These sessions have provided an opportunity for Customs to explain details about the charges and how they will be collected. At the same time, the sessions provided a valuable forum for feedback from all sectors of the importing community, much of which has influenced the implementation decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact on the industry is as follows: 103,000 importers generated around 2.2 million customs entries in 1995, containing 7.2 million entry lines; based on 1995 data, 95 per cent of importers have entries averaging less than 10 lines per entry; 65 per cent of importers bring in four or fewer entries&mdash;averaging 3.5 lines or less per year&mdash;and would incur total costs of approximately $100 per annum; 99 importers generated 1,500 or more entries each, together accounting for around 15 per cent of all entries; four of these importers generated over 10,000 entries, the largest importer bringing in just over 14,000 entries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Customs' annual funding will be reduced by an amount equivalent to that raised through cost recovery. This measure therefore aligns the cost of processing imports with that sector of the community&mdash;that is, the importers&mdash;which generates customs work, rather than spreading the costs across all taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure is consistent with the general thrust of government policy, which increasingly sees a closer alignment of costs with sectors of the community that benefit from the provision of public services. The user&hyphen;pays system is already used in relation to the recovery of the costs of processing passengers at international airports, through the passenger movement charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Customs currently recovers part of the costs of its electronic systems through charges levied on importers for import entries. This proposal sees an extension of a current cost recovery regime. The extension of the current charging arrangements relates only to commercial import processing. It does not cover <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7298"> activity associated with Customs' community protection function relating to the detection and interception of prohibited imports and drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises Customs' important role in this area and in this budget has provided funds to Customs to significantly increase the use of sophisticated technology to maintain and enhance its community protection capability. Nor will charges apply to the processing of export transactions. The exemption of exports from the new user&hyphen;pays system is a recognition of the key role export industries will play in improving Australia's trade balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Customs Service has played a leading role in the development of electronic systems which have enhanced its capacity to facilitate the efficient movement and quick release of cargo. This ultimately benefits the Australian community. The charging regime established reflects the efficiencies of electronic data reporting and will continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the cargo management strategy&mdash;an exposure draft which was released in August 1996&mdash;identifies opportunities for enhanced information mechanisms for information exchange between Customs and industry. Within the five&hyphen;year reach of that strategy, the key elements are: continued recognition of the importance of existing computer systems; to adopt enabling technology which simulates integration of those systems and allows more flexible reporting of information; to permit rationalisation of information needs and reduce duplication and redundancy; and to adopt new technologies which allow more sophisticated manipulation of information for risk management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end result will be a seamless and flexible system which will simplify information management for all clients and cater for future requirements. The delivery of these types of efficiencies will have a bearing on the ultimate costs to provide Customs' services to its client base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the cost recovery implementation, significant inroads have been achieved in creating flexible systems both for liability assessment and payment. This is consistent with the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thrust of the cargo management strategy. For example, settlement arrangements for manual reporting charges have been made more flexible. As a result of consultation with the cargo terminal operators, the legislation now allows for the CEO of Customs to agree to terms for settlement&mdash;potentially monthly&mdash;for some cargo reporters, rather than payment at the time of reporting. In recognition of the need to maximise electronic processing of information and to not disadvantage those operators that lodge electronic reports with Customs, Customs has undertaken IT enhancements that will result in the retention of electronic data and minimisation of reporting costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After an approach by the air express couriers, an arrangement for payment of the screen free charge has been agreed by Customs. This arrangement is represented by the payment of a reporting levy against formal entries lodged by those companies entering into the arrangement. For those companies that do not wish to participate in the alternative settlement scheme, monthly settlement will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost recovery implementation has enabled Customs to address a series of longstanding anomalies in its administration. An example is that for several years the air courier industry has criticised an inequity existing between entry requirements for air cargo imports and importation by post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Specifically, commercial air cargo imports valuing $250 or more have required an entry, whereas requirements for entries in the postal environment are for imports valuing $1,000 or more. The new arrangements see this anomaly disappear with a requirement for the lodgement of an entry for all commercial cargo over $250 in value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summing up, I would like to refer briefly to the background behind the budget decision to apply cost recovery for commercial customs activities relating to the processing of imports. As we in this House are aware, the government was faced with a huge task to turn around the Australian economy. The decision to introduce cost recovery to the Customs import process is in line with the government's general acceptance of the user&hyphen;pays principle.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7299">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new charge will have a beneficial side effect&mdash;it will attribute direct costs of the import clearance process to goods imported, thereby removing the burden for funding this process from the community generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the cost recovery is to do with commercial activity, it is also true that the import clearance process accomplishes far more than just collection of statistics and revenue. The entire customs process supplies importers with a mechanism which provides awareness of, and monitors compliance with, Australian safety standards, labelling and other consumer protection laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there is an obvious cost in preventing imported goods being used inadvertently or deliberately as a method of bringing in illicit drugs and other contraband. Goods manufactured in Australia do not present the same risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the deliberate exemption of the export process from the user&hyphen;pays regime, as I mentioned earlier, is also extremely important in the context of Australia's future. It is a recognition of the key role export industries will play in improving Australia's trade balance, creating more jobs and reducing the deficit&mdash;a task this government has made its highest priority. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here is another ill&hyphen;thought out bill that has some serious ramifications for small business throughout Australia. It is something that has been thrown together. Based on the last speaker's comments, everything has to be met to meet some deficit reduction while small business suffers. Whether it is R&amp;D research or any sort of level of assistance to business, the government's attitude appears to be that we can go without businesses in Australia as long as we have the deficit right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I wish to address the changes to the charges levied for small business to clear customs. Some changes are to streamline processing by adding an electronic link to allow faster clearances. But new charges are being levied on the processing of the cargo reports, import entry processing and the licensing of the approved place for the examination of goods. Customs are trying to cut the costs of process ing to `ensure that costs recovered do not exceed costs calculated to process import transactions'. They reckon the charges are limited to the calculated costs of delivering functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like either the minister or someone on that side to tell me why a small importer who brings in on each consignment an average of between $300 and $400 worth of goods by post suddenly will be hit with a charge of at least $42.65 customs and sometimes up to $80 just for the privilege of having to take longer to clear his goods because the customs officer has been moved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular small business, situated in a country area in northern Tasmania, imports goods from England, Scotland, Ireland and Canada from suppliers who previously could not make their goods available here due to the distance of the markets. Their import orders are not large because of the market size and the variety of interests of their customers. Currently, when goods arrive they undertake an informal customs clearance which takes no more than about five minutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this clearance, they inform Customs of the value of the goods, the sales tax and duty payable and the cost in Australian dollars. This is then faxed to Customs in Hobart and the goods are dispatched. All these consignments are worth under $1,000 and are imported by post. The amendments moved by the government have put a stop to informal customs clearances. Their user&hyphen;pays, cost recovery scheme will now involve a $44.55 charge for manual lodgment. This particular business will have to travel to Launceston to lodge it in person. It is going to cost for the lodgment and it is going to cost the small business money in travel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The alternative offered is that they can use electronic lodgment at a cost of $29.65. However, the advice on this was that they would need a customs agent to process transactions to qualify for this reduced fee. The agent has been charging this business $60 per consignment before they started doing the informal customs clearance themselves. From past experience, they believed that this fee would rise with the more formal clearances and licensing fees. They could be charged a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7300"> fee of $80 by a customs agent plus the electronic lodgment charge of $29.65. They quite rightly point out that, on a consignment of $300, these charges will make the business unprofitable. Although some charges might be applicable for large consignments, the very nature of this particular business prevents them from placing larger orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They said that they do not consider that a consignment of 15 books, usually worth $300, warrants a charge of $44.55 to process. This is not the sort of charge they can absorb into the cost price of the article. The cost of customs to this particular small business is 15 per cent of the transaction. There is no way any small business can cope with that sort of cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should have looked at ways of reducing the book work involved before proceeding with this legislation. There has been no attempt to discriminate between $1,000 orders and $300 orders. The scheme in the past worked quickly&mdash;the duty was paid where and when it should be. The time taken for the processing by the customs officer was minimal&mdash;maybe five minutes&mdash;and it could be done by fax, which cut down on travelling time. To change this to the cumbersome fee collection regime which is being suggested here without some minimum cut off for the value of the goods coming in&mdash;for example, $1,000&mdash;seems to be bureaucracy gone mad. Why change a scheme that works well, collects its money and costs little to implement? Has Mr Hilmer put his nose in here too?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Change to so-called `streamline elements of two existing fees' in this case is change for change sake rather than change to achieve efficiency. The government has obviously decided to cut people out of the Customs Service and is using the user&hyphen;pays principle to justify the cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also seeks to charge depots a licence fee of $5,000. I have sought advice on this from customs agents in Tasmania. Some have said that this will result in organisations being unable to afford to operate. Certainly, the smaller ones would have great difficulty. The customs department has informed me that there are 22 depots in Tasmania and they are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> currently served by 46 customs agents. The government wants to cut the number of agents, so it makes the depots unprofitable and they will close down. Only the big ones will continue to operate. Small business will be the loser. Small business is hit again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister should be sticking up for small business, not imposing more charges on it. He comes in and answers questions in question time by saying that the government is in the process of minimising costs to small business. This bill is going to impose more costs on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department mentioned that a lot of the costs will be eliminated once electronic systems are in place at the main airports and post offices. I suggest we put some of those bureaucrats into the middle of Tasmania, in outback New South Wales or in Far North Queensland for a few months and see how they get on. It takes me a minimum of three days to get a letter from Canberra into my office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of these isolated areas barely have telephones or decent television reception, let alone lines to allow such things as electronic data transfer. This means people have to drive to their nearest major airport. For people on the west coast of Tasmania that means travelling for 3&half; hours, and for most of the other people in my electorate of Lyons it means travelling for two hours. The Public Service is supposed to be a public service to help the private sector drive our economy. All this government seems to want to do is put obstacles in its way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The governments's intention to sell Telstra, its inability to get Optus and Telstra together to do the cabling&mdash;the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who represents the Minister for Communications and the Arts, gave some waffle on how this was somebody else's fault; he did not make any contribution to this debate&mdash;mean that the country and regional areas have no hope of being connected to anything, certainly not without paying a considerable amount of money in future. So much for the big argument of helping people in country areas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7301">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in the beginning, this bill is badly thought out. It will have all sorts of implications if it is carried in its present form. Some minor but critical amendments should be made to make all the difference to the small business sector. There is a strong argument to leave any major changes to charging on depots until the electronic transfer is available outside the major city areas. This should not take long if the commitment to do it is there. There should still be an ability to clear goods to the value of $1,000 through the informal clearance declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government should address these points before the bill goes too much further and before we end up in a disastrous situation for many small operators throughout Australia. There is no doubt that there are some major problems within this bill. They need to be addressed before the bill is passed by the parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the bluster of the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) in his second reading speeches, the Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) and cognate bills are blatant revenue raisers, nothing more and nothing less. The rationale employed by the minister is that they are cost recovery measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Cost recovery' are buzz words. They are buzz words used increasingly by successive governments since the early 1980s to justify new imposts because those governments chose to legislate in certain ways. In other words, the need for so-called cost recovery is created first by government legislation, then or some time later down the track the government decides that its laws have created the need for that very same government to claw back some, all or more of the cost that its own laws were responsible for inflicting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills are a classic example. Hitherto, there was no licence fee for customs depot licensing charges. Previously, import processing charges might have been expected to raise $17.6 million in a full year. But with the passage of this legislation the take will increase by just over $44 million or 250 per cent. A more modest&mdash;or is it less ambitious&mdash;increase is in the cost of section 85: <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> warehouse fees, computer recovery, refund applications and overtime for official services of $372,000. Nearly 11 per cent extra will be raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full&hyphen;year addition to revenue raised under the provision of all three bills being debated cognately will be just under $46 million&mdash;an increase of 69 per cent. This is not a bad little earner in times of low inflation. It might be laughable, given in particular the minister's crazy justifications for the imposts&mdash;if we could ignore some of the more serious implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where will the costs fall, for example? The costs will be borne by small businesses and consumers&mdash;a pretty good double for the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. He might very well be better described by the minister versus small business and anti&hyphen;consumers. It might be fair to ask the minister how he can look either proprietors of affected small businesses or consumers in the eye, but of course he does not. If this is an example of a minister who is for something, in this case small business and presumably consumers, God help us all if he were against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most import agents may be held up as classic examples of small business proprietors. Most other importers are small business owners who do not need, so far in our history, the cost of employing import agents. It is unarguable that these new charges will fall disproportionately on small businesses and their clients. But it does not stop there. Many, if not most, of the clients of import agents are in turn small businesses. These are the clients of import agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not clear if the minister expects agents to absorb the charges. Surely he is not so silly. He must know that all the additional costs these measures impose will be passed on down the chain, where necessary, through small businesses to the consumers of imported goods. So much for Labor's rorting of the wholesale sales tax system. They must have extracted all the blood that can be got out of that particular stone. The charges raised in these bills are no more and no less than an indirect tax by another name.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7302">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the coalition government, with the willing cooperation of the minister, had to scrape the bottom of the barrel and devise new charges, or exorbitantly raise existing ones, all to be embraced under the political speak terminology `cost recovery'. By way of an aside, if this parliament ever agrees to adopt an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board expenditure tax of one kind or another, it will only be as a substitute for existing indirect taxes including, hopefully, those now before the House. Levied at 15 per cent, one could not expect more because the cupboard is bare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for the responsible minister to explain further is not confined to his rhetoric which purports to support either small businesses or consumers. How often have we heard him rabbiting on in this place about the need to cut regulation and red tape, particularly as it affects the small business sector? It was a temptation to say that he may even have waxed eloquent on the subject, except some would not forgive me for such an exaggeration. Here we have another abundance of red tape, which the private business sector in general and small businesses in particular have to unravel at their great cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just examine for one minute the charges to be levied for processing imports. For an import entry application lodged electronically, the amount to be paid is $29.65 plus 20c per line after line 10. But, if the application is not lodged electronically, the charge will be $51.40 plus $1 per line after the first line. We do not seem to be told whether the importer has to have IBM compatible equipment to electronically lodge an application for an import entry, but it is probably buried in some obscure regulation either already at large or to be devised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next category involving a charge or charges is an application for import entry by air or post lodged electronically, in which case the fee will be $22.80 plus 20c per line after line 10. A similar application not lodged electronically will cost $44.55 plus $1 per line after the first line. For sea cargo, a fee of $2.60 per manifest line will be payable, $3 per house or straight line airway bill, whatever that might mean, and finally a screen fee <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> charge of $2.40 per house or straight line airway bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total to be raised by these charges will be $61,675,000 in a full year. However inconsequential the descriptions of the charges may seem, the cost to be added to imports is no mean figure. I have heard about journalists and others being paid by the line or according to the number of words written, but this one takes the cake. Perhaps the best advice we can give to affected importers is that they lodge manual applications, write in very small letters and use abbreviations of the kind used by the real estate industry in advertisements used to flog off houses. But even then, at $1 per line after the first line as well as an up-front charge, almost in both cases about double that of the electronically lodged equivalent, the manual alternative remains less than attractive. The message to hundreds of affected importers is that, if you do not already have a computer compatible with that used by the Customs Service, go out and buy one. But isn't that a cost of compliance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An interesting outcome, if not intent, of the electronic lodging provisions in this legislation is that boutique importers who do not have this capacity may be driven to engage an import agent. Do&hyphen;it&hyphen;yourself business people who have hitherto made their own arrangements with a minimum of fuss might be better served to hire an agent rather than pay the premium to be imposed on the cost of manual lodgments. And all for what&mdash;to suit the convenience of a government agency, a convenience that the minister has not even attempted to argue in his presentation. Such an outcome will involve a further increase in compliance costs for affected importers not previously needing to hire import agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talking about the cost of compliance, I have thumbed through all three explanatory memoranda and I cannot for the life of me find an estimate of the cost of compliance. Surely we have to have superseded copies, because I have heard the minister talk, almost to the point of tedium, about the evils of compliance costs inflicted on small businesses by government legislation and regulation. Perhaps the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, who is at the table, could <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7303"> give me the correct memoranda, which would undoubtedly include estimates of the cost of compliance with these bills, given the minister's strident advocacy in opposition to and awareness of burdensome costs of compliance with all types of legislation, let alone that for which he has sole responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obvious that such estimates are possible because each memorandum contains estimates of the amounts to be raised in a full year in each of the seven categories to which reference has already been made. For example, category 1, where an application for import entry is lodged electronically&mdash;the charge being $29.65 plus 20c a line after line 10&mdash;will raise $24,386,000. The manual equivalent, the second category, will raise $585,000 in a full year. Category 3 will raise in a full year $30,314,000, and so it goes on down to category 7.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is possible to estimate the revenue, it is equally possible to estimate the cost of compliance. But compliance cost estimates are nowhere to be found, and I do not see anyone rushing around the chamber trying to find me more up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date memoranda which might include the information. It raises the question: was this proposed legislation referred to the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, which has recently reported to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That question gives rise to two further queries. Firstly, if it was, what recommendations does the report contain about the increased and burdensome compliance costs which will ensue under these bills and be incurred by importers and consumers of imported products? The second supplementary question is: if it was not, why not? The sad truth appears to be that the quantum of compliance costs has not even been considered by the minister or, if it has, a deliberate decision has been taken to leave the estimates out of his second reading speech and the accompanying memoranda. In either case, a lack of both honesty and courage is in evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also seeks to make a virtue of the exemption of exports under what he quaintly describes as `the new user&hyphen;pays system' and goes on to acknowledge the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contribution of exporters to improving our trade balance, creating more jobs and reducing the federal deficit. So it is demonstrated that the user&hyphen;pays principle is not inviolate and, to the extent that it is applied to the Customs Service, will continue to absorb the costs of servicing exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not arguing against that, but the point is made: if it is not a firm principle to recover all the costs incurred by the Customs Service where users can be identified, then it ill behoves the minister and his government to pretend otherwise. In all logic, you could not do so, anyway. We know this government is as much in favour of pulling down non&hyphen;tariff barriers in its quest for fair trading internationally as it is of seeing tariff barriers removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it wants to be able to go to the World Trade Organisation, it wants to go there with clean hands. But wait a minute&mdash;what have we got here? New, increased and hefty charges on imports of a non&hyphen;tariff kind. There must be some mistake, surely. This is not what successive Commonwealth governments have espoused in recent times. What would the Cairns Group say? These are amongst the most cynically explained and stupidly argued pieces of legislation that it has been my misfortune to come across in 18 years in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is sincere, why can't it simply say that it needed the revenue to go towards the elimination of Labor's legacy of a $10 billion underlying deficit? Admittedly, it would also have needed to confess to ripping $46 million off consumers by way of an indirect tax by another name, and that is contrary to if not its election undertakings then at the very least the spirit of them. As it stands, the minister has resorted to a charade and has brought no credit to him, his government, coalition colleagues or this House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I foreshadow that the opposition will be moving amendments in the consideration in detail stage to the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996. Those amendments are now being circulated. They are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Clause 2, page 1 (line 9) to page 2 (line 12), omit subclause (2), (3) and (4).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Schedule 1, page 4 (line 18) to page 5 (line 11), omit item 13.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Schedule 3&mdash;Opposition to oppose.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996 and the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 form part of measures designed to increase cost recovery from the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia and from registered trustees in bankruptcy matters. In total, the measures proposed by the government are designed to raise $22.392 million over four years, being $3.648 million in 1996&hyphen;97 and $6.248 million per year in each of the out years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two bills seek to do this by, firstly, increasing the initial flag fall fee on estates administered by the Official Trustee; secondly, replacement of existing fees payable in respect of all bankruptcies by a flat levy on all realisations in bankruptcies; and, thirdly, requiring registered trustees to hold trust funds in interest bearing accounts and to pay the interest earned to the consolidated revenue fund, similar to existing arrangements for interest earned on the common investment fund managed by the Official Trustee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commitment to greater cost recovery in the personal insolvency area was foreshadowed by the government in meeting our commitments. In that document, the coalition committed itself to raising an additional $15 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7305"> million over three years in the area of personal insolvency. The document stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is some capacity for increased cost recovery in ITSA. ITSA has total revenue of approximately $27 million, of which $22 million originates from Parliamentary appropriations. Better cost recovery will result in further savings of $15 million over three years.</PARA>
<PARA>This proposed greater cost recovery is simply bad policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The persons ultimately likely to bear the costs of these increased fees will not be the people who either through their own financial mismanagement or circumstances beyond their control have gone bankrupt. Rather, it is creditors, the innocent parties in insolvency cases, that will be left to carry the burden of these increased fees. Most of these creditors are the small business owners whom this government constantly claims to protect. These measures will punish those businesses, not because they have done anything wrong themselves but because they had the misfortune to be dealing with a person who ultimately went bankrupt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why has the government got this measure so wrong? For a start, one need only turn to the sloppy job that was done in putting this commitment together. The estimates of expenditure and revenue raised by ITSA in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> were based on the 1993&hyphen;94 annual report. You would think that they would at least have got the most up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date figures before seeking to make a promise of this nature. As a result, the coalition failed to recognise that in 1995&hyphen;96 a total of $28.715 million was appropriated to ITSA and approximately $7 million was raised by way of revenue. Even in 1994&hyphen;95, the most up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date financial data would have shown the coalition that ITSA received $27.5 million in appropriations and raised $8 million in revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now turn to the individual fee increases. First, the flag fall fee on estates administered by ITSA will rise from $2,000 to $4,000. This measure is expected to raise $1.62 million in a full year. In estimates, the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department admitted that ITSA had estimated that the increase in the flag fall fee alone will reduce the number of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> estates producing a dividend from 45 per cent to just 30 per cent. Creditors in one out of every six bankruptcies will now not receive a dividend because of this measure alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the increase in revenue from the realisation charges will be achieved via an increase in the flat fee payable from three per cent to eight per cent. This measure is expected to raise $4.2 million in a full year. In the last financial year, the total dividend paid was only $12.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly and finally, the payment of interest earned on realisation by registered trustees to consolidated revenue is expected to raise $430,000 in a full year. This interest is currently paid to creditors. The revenue has been calculated on an assumed four per cent interest rate on such accounts, although no minimum interest rate is required by the legislation. The result therefore is a senseless slug that will only harm ordinary Australians&mdash;principally small business owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am glad to say that the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996 does have some redeeming features. The bill also makes a number of minor amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1996 which Labor does not seek to oppose. It is on that basis that I will shortly move an amendment to the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996 which will delete those provisions of the bill which seek to facilitate the implementation of the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996. For the reasons set out above, Labor will be opposing the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 in full.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996. Clause 4 of the bill imposes a fee of $1,500 on applications to become a registered trustee. Clause 5 imposes a $1,000 registration fee. As a result, first time applicants to become registered trustees must pay a fee of $2,500. Clause 6 of the bill also imposes a $1,000 fee for extension of registration. Clause 7 imposes a $500 fee for variation of the condition attaching to a person's registration as a trustee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the introduction of fees for registration as a trustee, similar in magnitude to the above, were foreshadowed by the previous Labor government's Bankruptcy <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7306"> Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. Accordingly, Labor will support this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills also provide me with an opportunity to raise a matter of growing concern in the community and that is the growing number of bankruptcies. If one looks at the rate of bankruptcies over the period from the September quarter of 1992 to the June quarter of 1995, one notices a very stable number of bankruptcies in the community with figures coming in consistently averaging 3,600 per quarter. However, over the last year or so, we have seen a disturbing trend. In the September and December quarters of 1995, the number of bankruptcies rose to approximately 4,000 a quarter. This jumped to approximately 4,400 in the March 1996 quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the government jumps up and starts blaming this rise on the previous Labor government, I think we all know that in the six&hyphen;month lead&hyphen;up to the last election the economy could be reasonably described as having collectively held its breath. The economy flattened somewhat as all the indicators showed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, with the election of the Howard government, we were promised a sudden boom in confidence in the business community. Quite simply, this has failed to materialise. As a result, the number of bankruptcies rose to over 4,800 in the June quarter and to a staggering 5,400 in the September quarter, the highest on record, I believe. Far from getting the post&hyphen;election bounce that was promised, by pulling half a per cent of GDP out of the economy this government has set Australia on a dangerous path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the September quarter figures show, the total number of bankruptcies and part X arrangements, assignments and compositions have risen in Queensland by over 45 per cent on the previous year. In the Northern Territory, Tasmania and Western Australia, the rises are 50 per cent, 54 per cent and 55.5 per cent respectively. In the ACT, the part of Australia most immediately impacted upon by this government's slash and burn approach to economic policy, the rate of bankruptcies has risen by a staggering 63 per cent on the previous year. One of the few states to buck this trend is, not surprisingly, New South <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Wales, the only Labor state, which had the lowest rate of increase in bankruptcies at only 19.6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members would be well aware, bankruptcies are one of the key indicia of the health of an economy. These figures demonstrate that, under this government, the economy, rather than booming along, is sliding into recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I wish to turn to the appalling way this government has handled the pursuit of Christopher Skase. We heard last week that the chase for Skase has been resumed, but only after this government and, in particular, this Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) let the Australian people down by failing to seize the first available opportunity to continue the pursuit of Mr Skase. On 26 August 1996, Mr Max Donnelly, the trustee of Mr Skase's bankrupt estate, made an application under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act 1996 for financial assistance to further pursue the assets of Mr Skase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 305 of the act vests the power to grant such assistance in the Attorney-General. However, as most of these decisions are primarily bureaucratic in nature, the power has been delegated to the Inspector&hyphen;General in Bankruptcy and the assistant secretary of the secretariat branch of the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia. On 27 September 1996, the assistant secretary, pursuant to that delegation, determined that the application should not be granted. Without knowing more about the detail of that application, it would not be appropriate for me to criticise whether that decision fell within the guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the decision failed to understand the importance of Mr Skase as a symbol of the excesses of the corporate Australia of the 1980s. It failed to recognise the deep hurt felt by the many ordinary Australians who lost money to this deceptive man. It failed to recognise the importance of taking all reasonable steps to pursue this man to the ends of the earth, to not allow him to forget what he, through his dishonesty and deception, had done to the good reputation of Australian business, to the esteem in which our laws were held and, most importantly, to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7307"> livelihoods of many good, honest, hardworking Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That a bureaucrat, strictly applying a section strictly in accordance with the issued guidelines, should too narrowly construe his duty is perhaps capable of comprehension. But, mindful of the very real anger felt by the Australian public towards Mr Skase, mindful of the damage he has done to our reputation and mindful of the way he continues to snub his nose at Australia and the rule of law from faraway Majorca, for the Attorney-General to initially condone such a decision is simply deplorable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was revealed in Senate estimates, the Attorney's office was briefed to the effect that the Skase decision was pending and it was likely to be on 24 September 1996, but the Attorney failed to act. His office was formally notified of the decision on 2 October 1996. Again, the Attorney failed to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite having the power to overturn this outrageous decision, the Attorney failed to act prior to the decision becoming public on 9 October 1996. Even then, despite his office being told the afternoon of that day that the story was about to break that evening on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>, and despite knowing that at any time he could have overturned that decision, the Attorney failed to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even when he did act, it took the Attorney six weeks to make a decision he could have made at any time. The fact that he and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) then had the audacity to blame the bureaucrats for a decision which they knew the Attorney knew about and which the Attorney's own inaction had condoned is not only one of the most appalling acts of denial this place has seen but also one of the most stupendous failings of ministerial responsibility of recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney owes an apology to hoteliers in Adelaide, florists, airlines, service station owners, limousine companies, computer firms, caterers, accountants, electricians, lawyers, couriers and even a Brisbane pub, who are all owed money by Mr Skase. He should explain just how he got this decision so terribly wrong. Just as importantly, he should apologise to the bureaucrats whom he has left carrying the can as a result of his own deeds.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even today some questions still remain unanswered. The government is refusing to reveal how much money the Attorney has set as the limit for the funding of the continued pursuit of Mr Skase. All the Attorney has said is that the amount is comparatively small when compared with the $800,000 spent to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that the reason why the Attorney will not reveal the sum is that it is embarrassingly small. It is so small that he is afraid it will show the government's decision to be nothing more than a cheap political stunt. It is hard to believe that Mr Skase will know what the nature of the action is simply because of the total amount of money to be spent. So what have the Attorney and this government got to hide? There is no reason why the amount approved should not be released. The Attorney should come clean and do it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole affair has been poorly dealt with by this government. Not only has it put at risk the important task of pursuing the assets held by Mr Skase that belonged to his fellow Australians; it also shows that this government does not understand the real pain and hurt caused to ordinary Australians by the profligacy of people such as Mr Skase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome, and so does the opposition, the government's decision to resume the chase for Skase. It is a pity that the Attorney appears not to have given this matter the commitment that it deserves when he initially did what he did. That commitment is important. Nothing less will satisfy the understandable outrage felt by the Australian people at the way this government and this Attorney have handled the issue. Nothing less will help to placate the anger the Australian people feel at the way Mr Skase has shown disrespect for them and for our legal system.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware that the excesses of the 1980s in corporate Australia occurred under the management of the former government. You would also be aware that the former government attempted&mdash;obviously not successfully&mdash;to recover assets from Mr Skase. I would like to reject the criticisms made of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) by the honourable member for Banks. As the honourable member for Banks would know, the Attorney-General is a very effective minister, a person who approaches his duties with a very great degree of ability and diligence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister at the table agrees. The Attorney-General has done the right thing. The Attorney-General has responded to concerns in the Australian community, and this government will continue to pursue Christopher Skase's assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must also reject the comments made by the honourable member for Banks concerning our approach to small business. This is the first government that has come forward with a firm program to recognise the fact that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In doing that, you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) has made a large number of announcements concerning the way in which small business will be able to do what it does best&mdash;that is, get down to business and create jobs. You would also be aware of the drops in interest rates that will assist small business to grow and invest, and you would be aware of the fact that the parliament has now passed the industrial relations legislation which will do away with Labor's job destroying unfair dismissal laws, enable Australia to get down to work and enable the creation of more jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to join the debate on the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996, the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 and the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996. As has been indicated, these bills are being debated in a cognate manner.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In accordance with the policy announced in our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> document, the level of cost recovery from bankruptcy activities involving the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia will be increased by an amount estimated at $3.648 million in 1996-97, rising to $6.248 million per annum in out years. Creditors who benefit from a credible and effective personal insolvency system will thus meet a more appropriate share of the cost of maintaining and administering that system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increased revenue will come from three measures. First, the initial fee charged by ITSA when administering bankruptcies which have funds in them will be increased from $2,000 to $4,000. This will produce increased cost recovery for the direct use of ITSA services by creditors of an estimated $1.6 million net per annum in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the current fee charged&mdash;three per cent&mdash;on all amounts realised and credited to trust accounts of bankruptcies administered by both ITSA and registered trustees will be replaced with a flat realisations charge of eight per cent. This increase will contribute to the cost borne by government in providing various ITSA services for the benefit of the full commercial community. This measure is estimated to produce an additional $4.2 million net in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, interest earned from trust funds held in bankruptcy and part X administrations which are administered by private registered trustees will be payable to consolidated revenue to further partly offset the cost borne by the taxpayer in maintaining the bankruptcy system. This has been the case in bankruptcies administered by ITSA since 1980, and the measure will thus place all bankruptcies on an equal footing. It is estimated this will produce an additional half a million dollars net in a full year. These arrangements are similar to those which apply in all states where interest on solicitors' trust accounts is used by law societies for public purposes such as the regulation of solicitors and the funding of legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The combined effect of these measures will place all creditors, whether their bankruptcy is administered by ITSA or by registered trustees, on a more equal footing in terms of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7309"> contributing to the cost of the bankruptcy administration system. The increased charges and fees will only apply in those matters where there are funds. They will not impact on bankrupts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislation is necessary to introduce these measures and, in respect of the increase to ITSA fees, will apply to new bankruptcies after the commencement date of the amendments. The legislation will also produce a simpler collection method for fees and charges that are taken. It will streamline administrative practices for both ITSA and registered trustees. For instance, private registered trustees will no longer be required to open a separate bank account for each estate nor issue receipts in respect of each payment into the estate. The government once again is taking the opportunity to reduce the level of paper work required of registered trustees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There has been some criticism of our plans to increase cost recovery of ITSA bankruptcy services. How can we justify this? In accordance with the policy announced in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS>, increased cost recovery from ITSA will raise an additional estimated $22.3 million over four years. Creditors who benefit from a credible and effective personal insolvency system will now bear a more appropriate share of the cost in administering that system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed fees and charges are not altogether new. They involve an increase in existing fees already collected or, in the case of interest from trust fund moneys in administrations of registered trustees, they apply requirements that have existed in respect of ITSA bankruptcies since 1980&mdash;16 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed arrangements for taking interest earned on trust fund moneys administered by registered trustees are similar to the situation affecting ITSA bankruptcies since 1980. They are also similar to arrangements which apply to all states where interest on solicitors' trust accounts is used by law societies for public purposes such as the regulation of solicitors and the funding of legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The combined effect of these measures will place all creditors, whether their bankruptcy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is administered by a registered trustee or by ITSA, on a more equal footing in terms of contributing to the cost of maintaining the bankruptcy administration system. The increased costs and charges will apply only in those matters where there are funds and will not impact on bankrupts. The legislation will produce a simpler method for collecting fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As I have outlined, there are three bills: the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996, the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996 and the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996. The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill proposes amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 that are consequential on the proposed enactment of the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 and the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill&mdash;the bills being debated cognately today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, fees and charges are imposed by rules made under the act. With the enactment of the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, these fees and charges would have been imposed under regulations made for that purpose. Introduction of a new interest charge and changes to the way in which existing fees and charges are calculated in respect of realisations and registration of trustees are proposed. The introduction of these proposed new arrangements imposing charges will require the enactment of new legislation. Consequential amendment of the act to give effect to these changes is also required and is proposed in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill proposes the removal of references to prescribed fees and their replacement with references to the appropriate proposed charges bill&mdash;one of the cognate bills. Additional provisions are also proposed to provide for administration of the proposed charges bills, in particular to allow for the orderly collection of charges by the Inspector&hyphen;General in Bankruptcy on behalf of the Commonwealth. Provisions are also proposed to allow for extensions of time in which to pay charges and the remission of penalties and charges in appropriate circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opportunity has been taken to streamline administration of accounts held by registered trustees by allowing them to consolidate <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7310"> trust account moneys into a single account if they wish to do so and they will be no longer required to issue receipts for moneys paid into accounts in all cases. They will also be no longer required to furnish receipts to the Official Receiver at the conclusion of an administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996 also ensures that the Inspector&hyphen;General will be responsible for ensuring the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act 1996, the proposed Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 and the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996 are complied with, and appropriate powers to allow this to occur are contained in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is clear that the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996 proposes the introduction of charges in respect of the estate administration function carried out by registered trustees and the Official Trustee under the Bankruptcy Act 1966. The realisations charge was previously imposed in the rules made by the Bankruptcy Act 1996. As a result of the enactment of the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, rules will no longer be made under that act. Instead, regulations will be made in relation to appropriate matters. The opportunity presented by the changes resulting from the need to revise the rules has been taken to enact separate legislation in respect of charges relating to bankruptcy, rather than imposing them by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interest charge is a new charge imposed in respect of interest earned on funds held in trust by registered trustees in relation to estates and other matters administered by them. The introduction of the proposed charge will place these estates on the same footing as those administered by the Official Trustee where funds held on behalf of estates and debtors are held in the common investment fund and the interest is paid to consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third bill is the Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996. This bill proposes the imposition of charges in respect of applications for registration of trustees in bankruptcy, registration of trustees, reregistration and applications to vary conditions on registration. These charges were previously imposed in the rules made under the Bankruptcy Act 1966. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Enactment of the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill would mean that rules will no longer be made under that act. Instead, regulations will be made in relation to appropriate matters. Opportunity has been taken to enact these charges in legislation rather than imposing them by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this is a very positive step forward because, quite often, there has been the accusation under succeeding governments that by passing so many matters over to the executive the parliament is in effect negating its responsibility to determine what the law ought to be. The fact that we are indeed enacting these changes in legislation rather than by imposing them by regulation is a very important step forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The issue of bankruptcy in Australia is clearly a very difficult subject. There have been Commonwealth acts relating to bankruptcy for a very long time. As in so many other areas in the law, it is a question of the appropriate balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In bankruptcy one wants to give the bankrupt person the opportunity to make a fresh start, make a clean breast of things, make a new life and take the opportunity to commence in business again. Having said that, it is important to recognise that a person who has gone bankrupt clearly has committed an act of bankruptcy and usually owes a considerable amount of money. Obviously, the creditors must benefit to the greatest extent possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think both sides of politics would not dissent from the principle that the bankrupt ought to be given the chance for a fresh start while ensuring that the creditors are treated in the best possible way. Where both sides of politics differ from side to side is in determining the appropriate balance. We believe that the amendments we are debating in the chamber tonight are an appropriate balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7311"> We reject the criticisms made by the honourable member for Banks about this legislation, about the conduct of the Attorney-General and about our approach to small business. We are a government which was elected on 2 March to give the people of Australia a fresh start. We achieved almost a record swing at the election. I am disappoint ed that those opposite simply have not recognised that they did not win the election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to have risen in the chamber tonight to speak to these three cognate bills.

<TIME.STAMP>(6.02 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the previous speaker, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), has mentioned, bankruptcy is a very troubled subject. It is rare that any of the people who are associated with a bankruptcy walk away from their experience happy. It is a little bit like family law: there is an absence of goodwill; there is an absence of a desire on the part of many of the parties involved to see the matter to a satisfactory conclusion; and there is a lot of ill feeling about the circumstances that may have led to the bankruptcy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe the law in this area is adequate, but I am not sure it is possible to devise a system that will adequately resolve all of the impossible problems that seem to arise in the administration of a bankrupt's estate. The amendments we are talking about this evening will make some improvements, but we would be deluding ourselves if we were to believe that this would bring an end to the problems associated with bankruptcy arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker has outlined much of the detail of these proposed bills; so I will not traverse that ground again. He has outlined what is aimed to be achieved through this group of bills and pointed out the reasons why the government is taking the action which is put before the parliament this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some reservations about the legislation. I am not sure that I am convinced by the arguments that the interest earned on estates should go to consolidated revenue. Obviously, the big losers out of any bankruptcy action are the creditors. It is the creditors who will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be losing out as a result of the interest money going to consolidated revenue instead of being shared amongst the creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that interest does go to consolidated revenue in circumstances where the Official Trustee is managing an estate but, in those cases, the Official Trustee is actively involved in the management of the estate. So it is probably appropriate there should be a greater recovery of the costs of that action from those who will get the benefit from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new interest charge imposed in respect of interest earned on funds held in trust by registered trustees in relation to estates and other matters administered by them will result in additional revenue to the Commonwealth&mdash;revenue that otherwise would have gone to creditors. There would have been two ways of achieving equity between estates managed by private insolvency practitioners and those managed by the Official Trustee. The second way would have been to return the interest to the creditors in both cases, but that would have had a negative impact on the government's revenue. In these current circumstances where the government is endeavouring to fund a $10.3 budget deficit inherited from the previous government, that option&mdash;whilst perhaps philosophically attractive&mdash;was financially impractical. So once again the government has to make a compromise between what might well be good policy and what might well be financially necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In this particular legislation, by ensuring that these charges come through to consolidated revenue, we are doing a disservice to creditors. We are also acknowledging the very obvious fact that the costs of bankruptcy not only fall on creditors, not only go against the bankrupt's estate, not only go to those who are associated with the process but also go to the government who has some responsibility for administering these matters. It is a pretty unsatisfactory state of affairs. The government has chosen this option, which I will not oppose when it comes to a point of a vote, but I have to say that it leaves me somewhat uneasy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned in my earlier remarks that the whole issue of bankruptcy means a great deal of pain and hardship for the bankrupt. They <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7312"> lose what assets they have been working to build up. In many cases, it ends a dream. There is a loss of confidence for them in their capacity to manage their own affairs and perhaps to work in business again. Of course, it also affects their family and their friends. It puts a great deal of stress on the family relationship. Many bankruptcies lead to breakdowns in families, as well as the loss of friendships and the circle of acquaintanceships which the person once enjoyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For creditors there are also great losses. They obviously lose money. Inevitably, they do not get the full return of the money owed to them. They feel cheated. They have acted in good faith with the bankrupts but do not get paid for the services rendered. It can sometimes affect their own viability in business. The fact that their bills are not paid does not mean they do not have to pay their creditors so they can be placed in a most difficult cash flow situation. There is frequently dispute and litigation which again leads to loss of time and effort on unproductive causes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They generally have to wait years for results, and not only is the money when it comes to them often much less than they had a right to expect but they have had to wait years to get what they receive&mdash;and now, of course, they will not even earn any interest on the funds that have been accumulated by the receiver manager. They have to return payments in some instances, as well, that have been made before a person became bankrupt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have recently had drawn to my attention a case in my electorate where a business was owed a substantial amount of money by another business. They went to court and a judgment was awarded in their favour with costs. They finally received the payment from their creditor only to find, about three months later, that the business became bankrupt and they had to return not only the amount of their debt but also the court costs which had been awarded in their favour when the judgment was made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people feel justly aggrieved. The court had found in their favour and their bill was finally paid after years of waiting. They had costs awarded in their favour but when <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their creditor finally went bankrupt they had to return all the money plus the court costs, then wait for their share of the distribution of the bankrupt estate. So there are many unhappy examples of the effect of one business on another when bankruptcy proceedings occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the obvious public examples of concerns in this regard have been the effects on subcontractors when a principal contractor goes bankrupt. Quite often this involves governments as well. There is a natural tendency, particularly from governments but also from people in private industry, to accept the lowest tenderer for a contract. Sometimes they are the lowest tenderer for a reason: they do not really have the capacity to deliver on the contract. So when the principal contractor goes into bankruptcy the subcontractors are left without being paid. I know many submissions have been made; indeed, a private member's bill was introduced into this parliament by the former member for Dawson to seek to protect contractors in these sorts of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very difficult area. The former Labor Deputy Premier in Queensland also propose similar legislation. But when it comes to bringing it into existence, it is not as easy as it might seem. There is no doubt that many people who start off in business by acting as subcontractors for principals in large contracts find that all their efforts are wasted when, through no fault of their own, their principal contractor goes into bankruptcy; they are not able to be paid for the work they have done and so their own business fails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, there are also some people who abuse the bankruptcy laws. There are people who avoid their financial responsibilities by irresponsibly running up debts which they have no intention of ever paying. Some people have no sense of shame about bankruptcy. It is just regarded as a part of business. They will walk away from their responsibilities and, as soon as possible, start up a new business and perhaps go through it all again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This also sometimes happens to people with very small means, even people who are just working in a trade, PAYE taxpayers and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7313"> others. It is a matter of regret that some people buy electrical appliances, motor vehicles and all sorts of things that they cannot afford, with no real intention of paying them off. They willingly go into bankruptcy and leave businesses around town having to pick up the bits and pieces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those sorts of things are really unacceptable. It is immoral behaviour but it is happening more and more. I do not know how you pass laws for morality. In reality, whenever we introduce laws into this parliament there are some people who are too clever and who find their way around them. The laws which I referred to previously, which affected one of my constituents who had to pay back money to a business after it had gone bankrupt, were introduced to try to catch the Skases and Bonds of this world who deliberately siphon their funds away into safe areas before they go bankrupt so they are able to live a lavish lifestyle, even though their creditors go unrewarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many of these cases, people&mdash;particularly the small people&mdash;have no assets and so go unpursued. It is completely pointless for a business to go to court, even to get them declared bankrupt, because the costs of all that action are more than they are likely to recover. Again, my attention has been drawn by a constituent to a problem within my own electorate of a man who has gone bankrupt owing about $100,000. He is still driving around in his wife's car and living in the house that was transferred to his wife several years ago. He has substantial superannuation and life policies which are exempt from realisation for the benefit of his creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My constituent asked me, I think quite justifiably: why can people put large amounts into superannuation and that money be safe from creditors? It seems in this instance there is substantial evidence to suggest that the person was aware of the fact that he had debts beyond his ability to pay and manipulated his affairs so he could continue his lifestyle and leave his creditors receiving nothing. In this case, the creditors pursued him: they spent $16,000 in legal expenses to be told that they could expect to recover absolutely nothing. So the creditors' savings have been lost in a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fruitless pursuit of somebody who, it seems, knowingly defrauded them of the funds that were rightfully theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet nobody is going to prosecute in this case, nobody is going to take this person through the courts, because it will be seen to be a useless exercise. I think there is a need to have some kind of effort made by law enforcement authorities to endeavour to follow through some of these cases where there may not be a lot of money involved but where there has clearly been a wilful attempt to defraud the rights of the creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that over recent times it has been increasingly difficult in business. The number of bankruptcies has increased substantially over recent years. Labor's economic policy&mdash;the 24 per cent interest rates, their punitive taxation measures, the crushing business paperwork&mdash;has really made it very difficult for many people to succeed in business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Labor government came to office, there were about 5,000 bankruptcies a year between 1982 and 1985. By 1991&hyphen;92, the number of bankruptcies had risen to 16,000. Since that time, in each financial year, there have been around 14,000 bankruptcies in a year. Many businesses are finding it increasingly difficult to survive under the threat of government regulation, the difficulties of competing with the multinational corporations, the huge shopping centres, the Coles Myers and so forth of this world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have also found it difficult to make payments such as fringe benefits tax, superannuation payments, the increasing workers compensation fees and the like. All these have really challenged business people to succeed. There has been increasing business regulation, and all of this has made it very difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But another problem has developed as a by&hyphen;product of the large number of redundancies that have been offered in the Public Service and in public instrumentalities over recent times. Many of the people who are receiving substantial redundancy payments&mdash;even volunteering to receive those payments&mdash;do so because they would like to have a go in small business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7314">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They leave their former, sheltered position in the Public Service to try to find a job running their own business. Business looks very easy from the outside, so they often go to the sunbelt areas of Australia where there are strong levels of growth. Many of them come to my own electorate and buy a small business, with little knowledge about how to operate that business, how you need to develop a cash flow, a business plan, how you need to work through the various issues that are associated with running your business. Many of them have absolutely no management skills. They do not know how to assess the financial records that have been put in front of them before they purchase the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They often pay far too much for what the business is actually capable of returning. In fact, in electorates such as my own there is a developing trade in small businesses. People establish a business, develop attractive premises and then wait for somebody to move up from the south or come from a redundant Public Service position with a substantial amount of cash to invest in the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, most of those businesses fail because of a lack of business expertise and a lack of capital, and a lot of people are hurt. The redundancy payment is gone, which leaves the individual disillusioned with business, with the community and with his own capacity to work in private industry. Of course, they also leave creditors around the town dissatisfied and upset that their accounts have not been paid. Many of these circumstances lead sadly to bankruptcy. Some of these people get advice early enough to be able to get out of their business or to get some management expertise to help them through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I caution all of those people who find themselves with a windfall amount of money from a redundancy payment or from superannuation to look closely at the business that they are choosing to enter before they make that financial commitment. They should make sure that they have got a business plan, get some expert financial advice, talk to people in the community about the record of the business that they are proposing to buy&mdash;does it really have a capacity to give them the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lifestyle, cash flow and income that they had been used to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, so many of these cases lead to bankruptcy, a loss of whatever assets the people have ever had and certainly the loss of their own confidence in their capacity to be successful in private industry. We have these many unhappy circumstances associated with bankruptcy: the unhappy experiences of losing life savings, losing friends and contacts, the discord that is always associated and the angry words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Insolvency practitioners have a very unpleasant task, Sure, their income is preserved&mdash;they are the only ones that get out of a bankruptcy with their income in place&mdash;but they have to accept a great deal of abuse and anger at creditors meetings. And then when the news finally comes through that the payment will be only a few cents in the dollar, everybody is critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some insolvency practitioners as well who leave a lot to be desired. I am aware of one case where there had been gross mismanagement of an estate. Fortunately there was another lawyer who was prepared to pursue the case as a white knight. The incompetence of this practitioner was well established but his only penalty was the voluntary surrendering of his licence. The creditors had to walk away, getting only a fraction of what they should have received. I call on the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) to use the additional funds that are going to be coming his way as a result of the interest funds that are going to be transferred to make insolvency practice work better, to make sure that estates are managed efficiently and well and to ensure that creditors get the maximum value for the dollar spent.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attached table has been prepared providing broad running costs expenditure comparisons.

The Senate received additional supplementation of $1.241m for Standing and Select committees2 whereas the House of Representatives received no additional supplementation even though it sought funding for the net increase of one new parliamentary committee established for the 38th Parliament. Up to now the principle has always been that the Department of the House of Representatives has received additional funding for the net increase in committee activity. There is within the House of Representatives a widely felt concern that the government recognised the Senate's need for additional committee funding but failed to recognise the same need in the House of Representatives, resulting in an inadequate allocation of funds to that House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Neither the Speaker of the House of Representatives nor the President of the Senate represented the parliamentary departments in ERC budget funding discussions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) As noted in the 1996/97 Portfolio Budget Statements for the Department, the Government's decisions to reduce parliamentary outlays by $10m (the Department contributing $0.3m in 1996/97) and to reduce departmental running costs from 1996/97 by 2% in addition to the efficiency divi <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7317"> dend of 1%, have required the Department to implement a number of savings measures to achieve efficiencies and to reduce or eliminate lower priority activities. The measures that have directly impacted on Members are: </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a reduction in expenditure on security services, which may cause inconvenience to building occupants arising from the more restrictive opening hours of access doors and the closure of some interchange points during non sitting periods (this measure was implemented jointly with the Department of the Senate);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a reduction in Members' personalised stationery entitlement, a reduction in the number of daily newspapers supplied during sitting weeks to Members (from three to one), and reduced staffing for Members' keyboard support pools; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> some reduction in planned funding for the replacement of Members' computing and office equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of broader support services to Members, for example, secretariat services to committees, the Department of the House of Representatives was unsuccessful in obtaining additional funding for new parliamentary committees established for the 38th Parliament. Up to now, the principle has always been that the Department has received additional funding for the net increase in Committee activity. This principle is considered fair and reasonable given that the establishment of the committees is a decision of the government and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Parliament and not the Department of the House of Representatives. To absorb the cost of the net increase in committee activity and to contribute to the funding reductions imposed on the Department, staff resources available to individual committees have been reduced. The savings were achieved through the introduction of linked secretariats to support pairs of committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the House agreed to the establishment of additional committees in the next 12 months or required an existing committee to undertake additional functions, additional funding would be essential. If additional funds were not provided this would have an impact on resources presently allocated to all existing committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important issue facing the Department of the House of Representatives (jointly with the Department of the Senate) is the failure to obtain from the budget any funding for the programmed replacement over the next 5 years of obsolete security systems. Additional funding is  required as the chamber departments were not provided with any funding for replacement of major security systems in their running costs bases.</PARA></ANSWER></RDI.ITEM></RDI>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak against the Euthanasia Laws Bill. In doing so, I would like to acknowledge the input from many of my constituents to my decision on this bill. There is no halfway with the issue that this bill seeks to override, no shades of grey. You are either required to vote for the practice of euthanasia or against it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under our democratic system, therefore, I simply cannot represent the views of each and every one of my constituents because in the end the democratic process requires me to vote in line with the views of some and against the views of others. But that is what life in this place is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always held the view that elected members of parliament should perform their roles somewhere between the Burkean notion of representation where the elected representative has a strong sense of what is right and what is right for their constituents and the participatory model of representation where the constituents actively participate in each and every decision that the elected representative makes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel that I have achieved such a mix in this case. The decision that I make on this issue is finely balanced between the principles that I believe should underpin public policy pertaining to euthanasia and its practice and the views of my constituents. The underlying principle in this case is that no&hyphen;one has the right to deny any person who is terminally ill and bearing insufferable pain the right to say for themselves enough is enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In making my decision in relation to the specifics of this bill and the law that it seeks to override, I drew on my experiences in watching the health of two of my grandparents deteriorate in the period leading up to their deaths. My maternal grandfather died after a long and painful fight with bowel cancer. One of my last memories of my grandfather was when I visited him in the nursing home and I was trying to interpret what he was saying to me. He was having difficulty making me realise that he wanted me to get him his sputum mug.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot remember a time when I felt more inadequate and this is the picture that too often flashes before my mind when I remember my grandfather. Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), this parliament or any other parliament in this country has no right to deny me the opportunity not to be remembered by my grandchildren in this way.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7319">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My grandfather had no intention of asking for assistance to end his pain and suffering. He was a very strong, stubborn man. But just because he displayed incredible strength and stubbornness, it does not mean that someone else in his position should be denied the opportunity to request such assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My paternal grandmother died late last year. It is very sad that she did not have the opportunity to see me arrive in this place as she had been a great supporter of my interest in politics for many years. But had she still been alive, she would not have known that I was here anyway as her mental condition had deteriorated over the previous two years or so. As with many elderly people, her short term memory was severely compromised and she became very weak in the last few months of her life. But I still remember her delightfully as my grandmother. Despite her confusion, she died peacefully without pain and she was well cared for at the masonic village in the electorate of the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opponents to euthanasia claim that people like my grandmother will become victims of foul play, that they will be euthanised against their will. The Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 is clear and it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A patient who, in the course of a terminal illness, is experiencing pain, suffering and/or distress to an extent unacceptable to the patient, may request the patient's medical practitioner to assist the patient to terminate the patient's life.</PARA>
<PARA>The key words here are `unacceptable to the patient'. No&hyphen;one else but the patient can know what is unacceptable to them and no&hyphen;one but the patient can make the request to the medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory's act also includes the conditions under which the medical practitioner may assist a patient to end her or his life. It includes strong penalties for those who seek to deceive or use improper influence to procure consent and it includes the provision that the medical practitioner shall `report the death to the Coroner by sending to the Coroner a copy of the death certificate.' To do otherwise than to follow the provisions in the act would be to contribute to an act of murder and thus prosecutable and punishable under the Northern Territory's law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People like my grandmother could not possibly have chosen the course of euthanasia as she was not competent to do so nor was she in pain and nor did she have an illness that threatened her life. She simply died peacefully one morning from old age. The Northern Territory's act could not have been applied to her and those who threaten that old people will be killed for convenience are guilty of creating a disgraceful and unnecessary hysteria amongst the elderly and vulnerable. Sadly, this fear is a recurrent theme in the letters that I receive from some elderly constituents. All I can do is write back and reassure them that the fundamental tenet of the Northern Territory's legislation is that of consent by the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory's legislation gives more protection to terminally ill people, who endure pain and suffering, than they currently have. At present they have no protection in the form of a legislative framework and nor do the doctors who selflessly assist them to end that pain and suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While an exact figure obviously cannot be provided, it is generally accepted that around 14 per cent of doctors admit that they have assisted terminally ill patients to end their lives. The Northern Territory's legislation gives protection to those doctors who feel that they should assist with their patient's request. It gives patients protection in that it requires their consent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7320"> and gives them a cooling off period to consider their decision. It requires that they are assessed as competent to make that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my state of South Australia, we have an excellent system of palliative care which is underwritten by legislation. The legislation enables doctors to administer pain relief to the patients even if that treatment contributes to the death of the patient. It seems to me therefore that there is a very fine line between the palliative care legislation that those opposed to euthanasia proclaim as the answer to the treatment of pain in terminally ill people and the Northern Territory's legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both acts provide for the active intervention of the medical practitioner to assist the patient relieve her or his pain. Death can be the consequence under the provisions set out in both acts. Intent can be the same under both acts. The Northern Territory act is more honest because it requires the patient to consent to the intervention that causes their death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opponents to euthanasia also argue that, in this day and age, palliative care can effectively deal with the pain experienced by patients. Doctors working in palliative care claim that around eight per cent of their patients still request assistance to end their lives despite receiving the best available care that medical technology can deliver. Palliative care does not work for everybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Northern Territorians have already passed the legislation through the appropriate democratic processes. The people of the Northern Territory elected their members of parliament in 1994. The parliament passed the legislation in 1995. The legislation was challenged in the supreme court earlier this year and the challenge was dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am somewhat bemused that I stand here, hardly well known for my hardline position on states rights, particularly when related to matters of environmental protection, raising the issue of the right of people in a state or territory to have their democratically elected representatives make legislation in parliament in line with that parliament's constitutional responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind the member for Menzies of his concern expressed to the House in August 1994 about the usurping of the rights of people in the states when the then Assistant Treasurer sought to do something he disagreed with. I suggest that the member for Menzies is attempting to do the very same thing that he accused the previous Assistant Treasurer of in 1994. Both the member for Menzies and I have at some stage advocated the right of duly elected state and territory parliaments to pass laws. I suspect that the reason that we differ on the right of the Northern Territory to make legislation pertaining to euthanasia is purely and simply that we have a fundamentally different view on euthanasia. That is all this debate is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate is simply about the right of the people in the Northern Territory, who voted for a government which passed a bill allowing euthanasia under certain circumstances, to be able to choose euthanasia under very tragic circumstances. It should also be about the right of all Australians to have the opportunity to choose to receive such assistance to end their pain and suffering, as many of my constituents who have watched family members die in pain have said to me. The member for Menzies has shown this House that he believes that his interference in the lives of terminally ill people in the Northern Territory is more important than their right to have such a choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I would like to refer to the concern that John Stuart Mill expressed in regard to threats posed to the liberty of citizens. Unlike the member for Menzies, I believe that Mill would support the practice of euthanasia. Mill was concerned about the threat to individual <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7321"> liberty posed by the state. He argued that there were two types of acts&mdash;self&hyphen;regarding acts and other&hyphen;regarding acts. Any intrusion by the states on self&hyphen;regarding acts constituted tyranny. Any intervention, therefore, by this parliament on the right of Northern Territorians to have the opportunity available to them to choose euthanasia is a tyrannical intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After much reflection and assistance from my constituents, I have formed the view that the right that deserves priority in this debate is that of terminally ill people to choose for themselves to die with dignity and to end their pain. No one individual, no organised church or community group, no one member of parliament or no parliament should have the right to deny them that opportunity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it is surprising or unusual that, at the moment, two debates of great moment are running: one on prejudice and one on euthanasia. It is interesting to observe that in both these debates, parliamentarians are being implored and beseeched to reflect the will of their constituencies by representing the mainstream view; the majority view. Whilst the debate on prejudice is raging in a form which is both malevolent and vicious, the debate on euthanasia is being held with a great degree of commonsense, courtesy and civility. If one speaks about free speech, this is one example of how to have such a debate. I think it would do all of us some good to reflect on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are doing so, we might reflect on what representing our community means and how we should approach it. We have all received letters from people advising us that we should reflect their will. This has become a mantra for some people in recent years. Of course, they would not deny the will of the 100,000 other people we represent. They assume that we have no way of knowing the will of the rest of the community. But representing people is not simply about reflecting their will; it is also about leading. If we simply reflect what people think, we stagnate as a society: nothing changes, there is no innovation and there is no development. On the other hand, if we simply lead and do not reflect, eventually no&hyphen;one follows. The balance between the two is the fundamental issue in both these debates. On the issue of prejudice, it would appear that the majority support a position of prejudice. On the issue of euthanasia, it would appear that the majority support people's right to chose their exit from this life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ironic part is that the position of parliamentarians is almost in the opposite direction to those two majorities. That bears some thinking about. In this complex life we lead, and given the complex role of democracy, the way those things are worked through will have great importance in the years ahead. The way we as parliamentarians handle those two issues will make and shape what we see as democracy into the next century. I am delighted that we are handling this particular issue with aplomb and with a majority view. On this particular issue we have personal experiences, personal views and philosophical positions. I find it very difficult to accept the point of view of many of my colleagues that a system can be devised where pushing one button is ethically allowable whereas pushing another button is not. I find it impossible to accept the claim that people who turn off a life support system are not doing so intentionally: that somehow the death of the person on the life support system is accidental or irrelevant to their act. I think that position is the position of those who have a conclusion and then try to manufacture the arguments to suit. There are no ethics in that. I think there is a great deal of dishonesty in the fabrication that, by turning off life support and allowing a person to die, they can say, `Mea culpa, but I am not responsible. I did not do it.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7322">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder how they would relate to the story out of the UK about the cleaner who turned off the switch accidentally. You wonder whether or not they should be charged with murder; technically they should be. But, in the same way, so should any doctor or any member of the hospital staff who turns off the switch knowing that in so doing the person will die&mdash;whether they die from the illness, from starvation or whatever. That switch may well be a switch that supplies food, so they starve a person to death. Somehow they say, `It's not my fault.' To assist a person to die somehow seems to be different. I find that the parallel is absolutely total. There is no differentiation in my mind, except for one thing: with euthanasia the person who is having the switch turned off or the button pushed off&mdash;whatever it might be called&mdash;has some say, some choice. The person on the life support system has no choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we then take the next step, which is the suggestion that this will lead to an outburst of murder, that suddenly doctors, nurses and families will be rushing off to kill people left, right and centre because they are expendable and disposable: the fact is that if doctors, nurses and families are like that, they will not want this legislation because it will impede them. In this case they will need the approval of the person involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people are so malevolent, if doctors are so bad, as to murder people because the law will give them permission to murder someone, why would they want the law to be passed? Why would the families who seek the benefit of someone's death want to put up an impediment to achieving that&mdash;the requirement of the person's approval&mdash;when at the moment they do not? If anything, euthanasia made legal will reduce homicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are getting is obscuration. People are putting forward to the community the proposition that euthanasia equals murder. Voluntary euthanasia is not murder; it involves a decision by the person themselves. What we have now is murder. We have a case in Victoria right now&mdash;I read it with some concern last week&mdash;where a man is being charged with murder because he helped his wife to die and he tried to kill himself but failed. A man of advanced years who did an act of great generosity, of great love, is now charged with murder because he failed his own suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Week by week we are seeing more and more cases of murder suicides of couples who cannot bear to watch what is happening. A man has been charged with murder not because he killed his wife but because he did not kill himself. If he had died, he would not be charged and he would not be dragged through a court to explain why he was carrying out his wife's wishes. I find those who argue from a Christian position to be very unchristian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had an experience in recent years of one in my own family who declined over time. He has spent some years not knowing anybody. I watched the effect on him, on his wife and on his children. I do not want to be in that situation ever. I do not want my daughter to see someone she does not understand and does not relate to. I do not want to see anybody have to do that on my behalf. I do not want the kind of life that would condemn both me and my family to what my family went through for that period of time. We all have examples of such cases and, if anything, that made it very clear to me that the idea of charity, of love and of care is not reflected by persistence with survival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to our ethical systems, to pre&hyphen;Christian ethics, and look at how values of life have developed. What we are finding nowadays with modern medicine and modern technology is that we can keep people alive in their bodies above and beyond anything we have ever dreamt of, beyond what our ethics were ever designed to cope with. We still call it the same word&mdash;life, l&hyphen;i&hyphen;f&hyphen;e. Therefore, it still means the same thing. The kind of life that we are talking <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7323"> about for these people is not life as we knew it, is not life as it was around the time of Christ or even before and it does not have the same value placed on it. What people are doing in this situation is putting a value on life which is not life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a difficult debate. It is one in which we will all choose our own paths, as we do for most issues, quite frankly. It is one the community needs us to lead and needs us to do so with some depth and some moderation. This debate will not finish today, this week or this year. I think it will go on for years to come. I am sure that at the end of the day our community will say to us, `Please give us the choice about our life. It is ours after all. Do not interfere. Do not tell us how to run our life, how to leave this life.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Proponents of the maintenance of the Northern Territory legislation have essentially either argued that euthanasia or state sanctioned killing is a good thing or, alternatively, they push the so&hyphen;called states or territories rights argument. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like you to listen very carefully to these words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Euthanasia legislation can have all the safeguards imaginable but, at the end of the day, the principle remains&mdash;one person kills another person. If that sounds dramatic, the simple fact is that that is exactly what is involved. In that sense, the numerous amendments that have been foreshadowed are irrelevant. You either support euthanasia or you don't.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The simple fact is that there is a huge difference between helping a person to die as opposed to killing someone. I believe that distinction has been lost on the proponent and those who support the bill. The moment you legalise doctors killing their patients, even with their consent and with benevolent motives, you cross an important threshold. You debase the currency of human life. The potential for error and abuse, the risk to vulnerable individuals and the profound effect on society's values presents the most compelling reasons against allowing assisted suicide and euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA>Whose words were these, Mr Deputy Speaker? Were these the words of Archbishop Peter Hollingworth? Were they the words of the Catholic bishops conference? Were they the words of the Buddhist movement, or Hindus or Muslims or any mainstream religion? No. They were the words of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Shane Stone, in the debate on the Northern Territory legislation in the Northern Territory parliament last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, Mr Stone, who has been such an opponent of the Andrews bill, clearly abhors euthanasia to the extent and to the same degree that those of us who are supporting this bill do. The Northern Territory effectively is asking this parliament to reject this bill on the basis of so&hyphen;called states or territories rights. If the Northern Territory were a state, then that argument might have some validity. I would like to outline to the committee section 122 of the Australian constitution, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit.</PARA>
<PARA>That says it all. This parliament has a responsibility to overturn the Northern Territory law. Members, when considering where they stand on this issue, should be able to consider whether they support state sanctioned killing, otherwise known as euthanasia, or whether they do not. The states&hyphen;territories rights argument has absolutely no validity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that some who oppose this bill found no problem in supporting the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill last year, which sought to overturn some aspects of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7324"> the Tasmanian criminal code on the basis of using the external affairs power. I abstained on that bill but have absolutely no hesitation in stating that I will be voting in this parliament to support this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that the debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill has been thought provoking. I have been impressed with the way that members on both sides of this argument have been able to put forward their views. One of our colleagues has said that this bill, in effect, has given us the opportunity to market the parliament. We have been able to show the Australian people that members of parliament are able to come to this place to vigorously and forcefully put forward where we stand on this issue and then make a decision. We will make a decision on this bill on our conscience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There does appear to be a great deal of confusion in the community over what is intended by euthanasia. Euthanasia is not the practice of turning off a life support system, where there is no hope of recovery, and allowing nature to take its course. Euthanasia is not effective pain management, even where increased doses of pain killing drugs might advance death. The question must be asked: is the purpose to relieve pain or cause death?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am opposed to state sanctioned killing, that it should be legal for a person in civilised society to kill another. The fact that it may happen now, in some isolated cases, does not mean that as a society, as a community, we should legalise it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been an inquiry in the Netherlands into what euthanasia practice is in that country. It is very interesting to note&mdash;I am indebted to the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Challenge of Euthanasia</EMPHASIS> by Brian Pollard&mdash;that there were a thousand cases of life&hyphen;ending actions without specific request. So in the Netherlands, doctors are terminating patients' lives without request. There were also instances where there have been some withdrawals of life sustaining treatment without request for the purpose or explicit purpose of shortening life. So where does assisted killing upon request cease and unrequested murder start?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This week's debate should also take note of the reports which we have seen from various parts of the world. In particular I would like to draw the committee's attention to the House of Lords inquiry in 1994 which concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be next to impossible to ensure that every act of euthanasia was truly voluntary.</PARA>
<PARA>We have all seen the comments made by former Governor-General, Bill Hayden, who refers to some frail elderly people as `unproductive burdens'. In a speech in 1995 he said that `succeeding generations deserve to be disencumbered of some unproductive burdens'. How do these people who are ill&mdash;at a time in their lives when they are feeling vulnerable&mdash;feel to hear the former Governor-General of Australia say that? At what stage would euthanasia, if legalised, cease to be an option and become an obligation? There could be people waiting for an inheritance. Would that give the unspoken message to those people who might be terminally ill that it is really time to flick the switch? I would be sad if we as a society got to a situation where euthanasia were legalised. I believe it would be sad if we as a community failed to overturn the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory legislation is not simply a law for the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory would become the euthanasia capital of Australia. The Northern Territory would be a place where people from throughout the country went to to take advantage of the Northern Territory legislation. I am concerned that some of those people who are normally outspoken in their support of Aboriginals are in fact ignoring the fact that the Aboriginal community is very opposed to the Northern Territory bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As parliamentarians in this debate, we have an historic opportunity to stand up for the vulnerable, the poor, the sick and the disadvantaged. I believe that we have an obligation to stand up and be counted. I would like to quote the Northern Territory Attorney-General, Mr Denis Burke, who has also been vociferous in his opposition to the Andrews bill. In disagreeing with Marshall Perron, he said:</PARA>

So it will be with the third, on the private member's bill to overturn the Northern Territory's euthanasia law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A debate in which the outcome is uncertain and depends on the quality of the discussion itself is of the greatest rarity&mdash;an occasion when this parliament itself can take a lead. How appalling then that this debate has been shunted off to a committee room with a 10&hyphen;minute limit on speeches, without members actually listening to each other. In this debate, it is my conscience that I must follow&mdash;a conscience shaped by knowledge, analysis and, I hope, compassion. I adopt the words of Edmund Burke in his celebrated address to the electors of Bristol in 1774:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion.</PARA>
<PARA>I see both sides of the euthanasia debate all too clearly. No other issue has troubled me so much because I am not sure that I am correct. Nevertheless, I have a moral obligation to vote&mdash;to choose. I cannot abstain&mdash;indeed, not to choose is to choose. The contribution of Sir Gustav Nossal to the collection of essays entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The last right? </EMPHASIS> puts the position with compassion and clarity and I adopt his words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dying with dignity and in peace should be everyone's right, particularly in an industrialised country with high standards of health care. Nevertheless, I am against the formal legalisation of euthanasia. A well-ordered society is a very fragile thing, as recent history (Hitler, Pol Pot, Rwanda) shows. I believe there are grave dangers in a society giving to anyone, no matter how well intentioned, the right to terminate a human life. However, I do believe that those who are terminally ill should come to the end as free of pain as possible and with as tranquil a state of mind as possible. This may necessitate the use of strong drugs in doses that imperil life. I certainly do not believe that fear of possibly fatal consequences should limit the dosage of narcotics, tranquillisers or other medications in such circumstances. It seems to me that the crucial thing here is intent. The intent to relieve pain and suffering is good; the intent directly to kill breaches what I consider to be societal norms. Enshrining a right to terminate life in legislation would, I believe, do more harm than good, although I totally support the right of others to disagree with this view. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7326">  </PARA>
<PARA>The valuable contributions of Mr Justice Michael Kirby and Sir Ninian Stephen are along parallel lines. I support the Victorian Medical Treatment Act 1988 and would commend it to the legislature of the Northern Territory. At the consideration in detail stage of the bill, after the passage of the second reading of the Andrews bill, I propose to move some amendments to the three schedules of the bill to incorporate the broad thrust of the Victorian act. The Victorian act, now adopted in South Australia as well, was introduced by a Labor government, drafted, as it happened, by Mr Kevin Andrews, who was later to become the federal member for Menzies, and endorsed by Archbishop Sir Frank Little. However, on several points my amendments would go further than the Victorian act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know very well that the practical outcome of the Victorian legislation has led to a good death&mdash;literally, in the Greek, euthanasia&mdash;for very many terminally ill patients, but where death is the side effect of heavy sedation, a corollary of the treatment of acute and chronic pain, not the result of direct intention to terminate life, death by timetable, death by appointment. The practical outcome probably differs very little&mdash;merely a delay of hours or days&mdash;but the moral implications are completely different. It does not force a physician to pass over the Rubicon&mdash;to transform his or her role from a preserver of life to a terminator of life. There have, of course, been no prosecutions under the Victorian law. To the best of my knowledge, the law is working well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been following recent decisions in the US Supreme Court where a bare majority of judges is now re-defining limits to privacy&mdash;whether rights over matters involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime are central to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, guaranteeing equal protection under the law. Justice Anthony Kennedy said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.</PARA>
<PARA>These words first used in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, an abortion case, have been adopted by other courts in euthanasia and assisted suicide cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The US Supreme Court majority may be moving towards a distinction between the realms of `private law' and `public law'. Such private law would include sexual orientation, contraception, which used to be illegal in some American states, abortion&mdash;the great philosophical divide being on whether a foetus is to be regarded as a person&mdash;and assisted suicide. Some state courts have struck down assisted suicide laws, but these cases are yet to go on appeal to the Supreme Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could not imagine a more central illustration of privacy than choosing the way we die, and this includes assisted suicide or `assisted passage', as I have called it. In matters of life, death and sexuality, the realm of public law remains in the areas where there are identifiable victims&mdash;where there is no consent, or where children and the incompetent are, correctly, deemed to be incapable of consenting. I am increasingly drawn to this division between private and public law and I would prefer less rather than more state intervention by way of regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when economics rationalism is the dominant paradigm, with its obsession that all values have a dollar equivalent, the medical system will come under increasing pressure to speed up the turnaround time in hospital beds. In the Northern Territory, the fear of Aboriginal groups about how the law might be applied in practice is understandable, although, I hope, misplaced.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7327">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I felt distinctly uneasy about Bill Hayden's view that `utilitarian judgments . . . cannot be totally ignored' as if loss of productive capacity was a prelude to elimination in a brave new world. I have always thought that the key element of civilisation is that we preserve at infinite cost elements of life and experience which cannot be justified on purely utilitarian grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this bill is carried, will the Howard government put more resources into palliative care? I hope so, but I could be permitted some scepticism. I have real difficulty with the idea of institutionalising euthanasia by setting up legislative protocols. A very highly qualified House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics 1994, chaired by Professor Lord Walton of Detchant, a neurologist, was repelled by its observation of Netherlands practice. The committee concluded that there was a high risk of involuntary euthanasia being applied and where terminally ill patients are under a burden of guilt, as well as disease, and feel they must relieve and end the suffering of family and friends and the drain on resources. This guilt pressure may prove to be the thin end of the wedge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resource, or utilitarian arguments for euthanasia can also be applied to the issue of capital punishment and I repudiate both. I am well aware that passive euthanasia occurs already and will continue. On balance, I have more confidence in the role of medical practitioners operating under existing moral and ethical constraints within the profession, and with the provision for `living wills' and the appointment of agents, than providing an institutionalised code, supervised by a state or territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great British judge Patrick Devlin, in his 1985 book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Easing the Passing</EMPHASIS>, quotes his summing up in the famous trial in 1957 of Dr John Bodkin Adams:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the first purpose of medicine, the restoration of health, can no longer be achieved, there is still much for a doctor to do, and he is entitled to do all that is proper and necessary to relieve pain and suffering, even if the measures he takes may incidentally shorten life. This is not because there is a special defence for medical men but because no act is murder which does not cause death. We are not dealing here with philosophical or technical cause, but with the common sense cause. The cause of death is the illness or the injury, and the proper medical treatment that is administered and that has an incidental effect on determining the exact moment of death is not the cause of death in any sensible use of the term. But . . . no doctor, nor any man, no more in the case of the dying than the healthy, has the right deliberately to cut the thread of life.</PARA>
<PARA>With all due respect to the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory, I had not thought of it as providing moral leadership for the rest of the world, especially as there is a deep division between those members who are committed to the principle of euthanasia per se and those, such as the honourable member for the Northern Territory, who feel obligated to support the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act as an assertion of territorial sovereignty, a position shared by the legislators of the ACT and Norfolk Island. Cocos Island and Lord Howe Island are silent on either issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Oddly, the Northern Territory's remonstrance does not refer to section 122 of the Commonwealth constitution which gives this parliament a specific head of power over legislation passed in territorial legislatures. Until the Northern Territory becomes a state, or until the constitution is revised, there can be no moral, legal or political objection to the Commonwealth parliament exercising its functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of 128 sections in the Commonwealth constitution, I estimate that there are 32 which are either irrelevant, anachronistic or purely transitional&mdash;without counting those sections relating to the exercise of monarchical power. Section 44 which led to the Lindsay by&hyphen;election is one of them; section 122 is another.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7328">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am singularly unimpressed by the argument that, because public opinion polls support euthanasia, the Northern Territory's law should be allowed to stand. If the Northern Territory decided to restore the death penalty, that too might generate rousing support as indicated in public opinion polls, but I would not hesitate to vote to overturn it if it was brought before this parliament under section 122. I am very conscious that, having been constrained by the clock, I  delivered the early part of my speech with excessive speed, but it will read well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to acknowledge at the outset that this is a very difficult issue to debate, particularly for politicians. In the course of a week we are expected to be experts on perhaps 15 or 20 things. In the course of a term or a career in this place we are expected to be experts on hundreds, if not thousands, of issues. Generally, we do not do a bad job, but on euthanasia the truth is that none of us can be certain that the stance we take is 100 per cent the correct one. The public out there support euthanasia&mdash;75 per cent to 25 per cent&mdash;whereas probably in this chamber the members oppose euthanasia 75 per cent to 25 per cent. But whichever stance we take, it is going to be politically harmful for us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two initial points I wish to make in this debate. The first one is on section 122 of the constitution. I believe that it quite clearly and absolutely states that the parliament can overturn any territory law. It cannot do so with a state. Of course, that begs the question: what would happen if we overturned this law? If the territory became a state in two or three years time and reintroduced the law, we would have no power over that state. The second point worth making is that in so many areas of medicine, science has bolted ahead of the law. That is exemplified in this debate here today. I am genuinely torn on both sides of the argument because I can see both sides have very valid points to make. On the one side we have the Christian arguments, the sanctity of life arguments, the moral arguments, the argument that this will be the thin edge of the wedge if it is introduced, and so on. On the other side we have the argument that you have the right to determine the course of your own life, especially the quality of your life, and the belief that we should have compassion for those in intractable pain, and so on. On balance, I come down on the side of the right to euthanasia. While my wife disagrees with me, my 85&hyphen;year&hyphen;old father is in strong agreement with me, so there is division even within my own family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one thing I wish to acknowledge. The opinions of most of us are shaped by the experiences of our past. Several years ago my own mother was very sick in a small country hospital for several weeks. I tried to visit her daily. I had to go through the room next&hyphen;door to see her. In the room was an elderly lady who was deteriorating day by day. She had cancer of the cheek muscles&mdash;I think it must have been rhabdomyoma. It was slowly eating away her cheek muscles. It was exposing her molar teeth, the inside of the back of her mouth and parts of her skull. It was a gruesome thing to see on a daily basis. She could not eat. She could take a little fluid orally. It was trickled down her throat to ease the dryness in her throat, but most of it ran out of the side of her mouth. She became lighter and frailer with each passing day. She was in constant pain that was not relieved in any way by morphine. Heroin, of course, had been banned by then. It was only her pioneer toughness that was keeping her alive. There was an odour of rotting flesh. Nursing staff were reluctant to go in. She was suffering a gross loss of dignity. She had little control of her body functions. I do not know whether that woman, if she had been competent to do so, would have chosen to die. I suspect she would have. In her case there was no life support system to turn off. To me, the fact that her life was prolonged in the way it was, was an act of utter cruelty. The achievement&mdash;if that is what you would like to call it&mdash;of keeping her alive was nothing more nor less than an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7329"> obscenity. I was a farmer and a veterinary surgeon. If I had acted in such a way with my animal clients I would have been hauled up, quite rightly, by the RSPCA and charged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that in the transition period as we go from nature taking its course into the realms of modern medicine that we have seen over the past decades&mdash;and will go over in the decades ahead&mdash;we are in danger of losing our way. The Eskimos used to take a walk in the snow, and the nomadic Aborigines used to leave the old and frail behind. But now we have palliative care: 99 per cent of the time it is doing a magnificent job and it is being improved all the time. But it is still sadly inadequate for a small number of sufferers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our desire and duty to prolong life, in a very small number of cases, sometimes, paradoxically, we are destroying life in a quality sense by keeping these people alive. To force these people&mdash;small number that they may be&mdash;to stay alive and to suffer, to lose their dignity, when I believe nature and God, if you like, would not have subjected these unfortunate people to this gruelling marathon of torture before their death, I think is wrong. To do it in the name of civilisation, to do it in the name of modern medicine, to do it in the name of religion, I think is a cruel distortion of what is normal. We should meditate upon that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people do not have life support systems to be withdrawn. Some do not have doctors who are willing to overdose them to get the double effect to create their deaths. Others do not have the choice of suicide as some do, because they cannot do it themselves. These people who are being offered this choice in the Northern Territory are going to have it denied them if we vote against it. I fail to see the logic of that. If you believe in the sanctity of life, in the right of people not to suffer, not to have this dreadful indignity, I think it is tragic that these people could have that choice taken away. I believe the Northern Territory recognises the quality and value of human life in their bill. There is a flow chart that they put out which I would like permission to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> if possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The chart read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7330">
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7331">
<PARA>That diagram shows that there are 22 steps that must be gone through, which I believe most speakers in this debate have not clearly read. You have to be over 18 years old. It has to be voluntary. It must be requested by the patient. The general practitioner must agree. A specialist then must agree. A psychiatrist then must agree. There are two cooling off periods, one of seven days and one of two days. The implications must be discussed with the family, and so on and so on. It is as foolproof as you can get it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those who oppose this bill but still condone life support systems being turned off, sometimes without patients' permission, and also to those who condone overdosing of patients, sometimes without their permission, but who do not agree to this, I say, quite frankly, that I cannot understand the logic of it. We can kill people against their will, done for the most compassionate and noble of purposes, but we can oppose this, where it is done with even greater carefulness and regulation. That to me seems to be totally illogical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is not about overturning murder, as some have said. This bill is largely about assisted suicide in a most humane form. I believe that, if we vote against the Northern Territory legislation, we will do a small number of people a great disservice and condemn them to a degree of suffering that no human being should have to endure or would have to endure if they chose to take the alternative path that the Northern Territory government has offered.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my view, the debate on euthanasia should not be being held here. This chamber was set up to hear the least controversial, least contentious pieces of legislation. What we have instead is one of the most controversial, most significant, pieces of legislation coming here. It is the only bill this year where we have had a conscience vote, the only bill where the outcome is not predetermined, the only bill where the debate is not set piece and could actually change votes. As Michael Gawenda said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The debate on the Andrews Bill should not be shunted off to a Committee Room. Instead, it should be shown on national television so that all Australians can see and hear their political representatives wrestling with their consciences on this life&hyphen;and&hyphen;death question.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>For me this is a tough call. There are strong arguments on both sides. I understand the force of Bob Dent's message. I understand the force of the argument that people should be allowed to determine what they do with their lives. I do not personally think that suicide or attempted suicide should be a criminal act, although I do find it hard to work up any sympathy for those who leave children behind or, even worse, take them with them. But, as they say in the law, hard cases make for bad law, and I will come to that later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a fascinating debate because you find people in all political parties on different sides of the debate. If we examine why this is, I think it tells us quite a lot about our attitudes not only on ethical and moral questions but also on what we see the role of the states and the government as and what government is actually there to do and not to do. While most conservative politicians are quite comfortable with free market economics&mdash;although, interestingly, some commentators like Gerard Henderson and Robert Manne are awake to its shortcomings; I have even heard this bill's author speak against privatisation&mdash;quite a few are uncomfortable about libertarian social policy, support censorship and have problems with, for example, abortion, homosexuality and euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That seems to be the basis for the different factions now springing up in the Liberal Party, such as the Lyons Forum, which has the view that government should intervene in these questions, and the John Stuart Mill Society, which has the view that it should not. I do not feel the need to address the views of either the Lyons Forum or the John Stuart Mill Society. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7332"> I want to talk to those in my electorate, close to 300 of whom have written and some of whom came to see me  about this issue. I want to explain to people like the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), for whom I have immense admiration, good friends like Gary Jungworth and Eva Jones, who are Labor Party members, and one or two members on my staff, who think differently about this issue, why I believe that the progressive position is to support the Andrews bill and to oppose euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the state plays an important role in making our community better. I am not attracted to anarchy. I do not like the economic law of the jungle which leads to beggars in the streets and the dogs and armed guards patrolling the estates of the rich and powerful. That is how it is in some countries. I hope that the free market fetish of the Liberal Party does not bring it here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think anything goes. I do not have any problem about government getting in there and outlawing things which diminish us as a society. It ought to be understood that euthanasia is, first and foremost, a contract between a doctor and a patient. The Labor Party has never believed in unlimited freedom of contracts. We do not believe in freedom of contracts that exploit workers, particularly children. We do not believe in freedom of contracts between heroin dealers and buyers. We do not believe in freedom of contracts between gun dealers and buyers. So the question is not about the freedom of contracts. The question is: what is the social impact of euthanasia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To answer this question, we first need to clear up some misunderstandings. The European Association for Palliative Care points out that there is a lot of misunderstanding of the difference between dying with dignity and euthanasia. `Dying with dignity' has become a slogan of opposition to useless and degrading prolongation of life when a patient's organs, or those still minimally functional, can no longer support or permit the exercise of self&hyphen;fulfilling personal control over life's events. The association says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A time comes in the course of a disease when it is wrong to continue to prolong life aggressively and when it is right to honour informed patient's refusal of treatments that only prolong suffering.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with them. I was proud to be associated with the Victorian Labor government's dying with dignity legislation. I think that the Northern Territory government should now look to this as a model for its own situation. The association also says that the legalisation of euthanasia, the active intervention which kills a patient, is unnecessary and dangerous. With the development of modern methods of palliative medicine and palliative care they say that the civilised solution rests with a rapid implementation of programs of palliative medicine and palliative care not with the resignation to pressure for euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all received a lot of correspondence on this issue, but the letter which had more impact on my position than any other came from Father John Brosnan, who has been the Pentridge Prison chaplain for 30 years and is a famous opponent of capital punishment, which is a position I share. Father Brosnan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are important parallels between the state sanctioned killing which we call capital punishment and the state sanctioned killing which is now being called euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA>First, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If someone's life appears to be worthless, allowing that problem to be addressed by killing the person allows society to avoid having to take the harder and more expensive road of actually providing resources for a more supportive, interesting and caring way of life.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, he said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7333">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the opponents of capital punishment are not so much opposed to capital punishment in principle, but were most concerned at the possibility&mdash;indeed the certainty&mdash;that innocent people would be killed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is my position also. As Father Brosnan pointed out, mistakes are inevitable. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With capital punishment and euthanasia every mistake is permanent. There is no turning back.</PARA>
<PARA>In his letter he also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fanfare which accompanied the first lethal injection in the Northern Territory will not be around for those who will be the victims of pressure or abuse.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the evidence from the Netherlands, where euthanasia has been allowed, is quite disturbing. I have got to say that the reports that 52 per cent of all euthanasia there is non&hyphen;voluntary is so alarming that I find it difficult to believe. Irrespective of whether that figure is right or wrong, the British House of Lords concluded after an analysis of the Netherlands situation that it had been impossible to set safe limits to euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also been influenced by the writing of Robert Manne, who expressed his concern. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family pressure will be applied which will suggest to someone who is terminally ill that no good can come from their purposeless clinging to life, that they have become a mere burden, and that they owe it to their suffering family to request an officially sanctioned death.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly do not want my parents or anyone else to have to ask themselves that kind of question. I regard every breath of air I get on this earth as a privilege. There will not be much dignity about the way I go: I will fight for every last gasp. I will be dragged out kicking and screaming. I think that is the way most of us are made. I do not think that we should become disposable or be asked to consider at what point we are a burden and should be giving it away. Robert Manne also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor is it merely from family pressure that abuse may occur. We live, notoriously, at a time where the population is ageing, where our health systems are under great pressure, and where an economic rationalist view of the world is emerging triumphant in one sphere after another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In such circumstances, once the cultural bridge leading to officially sanctioned killing has been crossed, is there anyone who can seriously doubt that, in the long term, social pressures will build for cutting costs by rationalising the process of death in the case of the terminally ill?</PARA>
<PARA>There you have it. Euthanasia is the economic rationalists' solution; it is the efficient solution. While we are productive, well and good. But, when we start to break down, stick us on the scrap heap. That is why I will be voting for the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will respond to a couple of the arguments raised against the Andrews bill. Some people say this is an issue about states' rights. Jeff Kennett says that the Northern Territory is a duly constituted democracy. I have got to say that in Victoria he has sacked councillors and installed commissioners to run cities with a larger population than the Northern Territory, so I think that is really a joke. The Commonwealth has often intervened&mdash;without regard to states' rights&mdash;to set national standards, to protect world heritage, to combat racial discrimination, and to provide for sexual privacy. It should again here. Let us not in future have any cant or hypocrisy from those Liberal and National Party members who vote for this bill about states' rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some also say that the legislation does not reflect the reality of what happens in hospitals and that it subjects doctors to criminal liability for acts of kindness they commit every day. If that were the case, you would expect the AMA to be opposed to the Andrews bill. In fact, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7334"> the AMA has indicated that it believes that doctors should not be involved in acts of euthanasia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will continue the remarks that I made in the grievance debate on Monday, 28 October. Before I complete what I began during that 10&hyphen;minute address, I would like to remind the House where I come from on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I practised medicine for 13 years. I have cared for many people who have died, and their families. I chaired the ethics committee of the Australian Medical Association for three years and have been involved in the examination of the improper behaviour of doctors. I was also involved in the development of public policy for the medical profession in Australia through the AMA. In fact, my own brother died last year&mdash;he was a member of the Society for Voluntary Euthanasia&mdash;from a disease which he had had for some time. So, I have some experience in looking at this from all sides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate is about euthanasia. It is not about territory rights and it is certainly not about state rights. It is about whether, in any part of Australia, we are prepared to see the fundamental tenet of society changed; whether, as a nation, we are prepared to legally sanction, one human being intentionally&mdash;no matter how meritorious the circumstances&mdash;setting out to end the life of another. For example, at the moment in Tasmania, we have a man who has admitted to heinous crimes. If convicted, the one thing that we can say with certainty is that, whilst many members of the community may feel that people like that should be put to death, he will not be put to death because as a society we do not believe in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), my friend and colleague, said a number of things. She said that she is a Liberal and she is proud to be one and that, as such, she believes that people have rights and those rights ought to be defended. I saw her on television say that euthanasia was a human right which the Andrews bill seeks to deny people. The problem I have, whilst that is an attractive proposition, is that when one person exercising what he or she sees as an individual right diminishes the rights of those in similar circumstances then, as a society and as a government representing it, I think that we have to say, `No. This is not something which we will allow.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right of one person to choose the timing and the manner of his or her own death is not more important than the right of vulnerable others in similar circumstances to feel free of the guilt of continuing to live. We have laws which we have passed this year in relation to gun control which infringed the rights of individuals, and we did so because we knew it to be in the interests of the entire nation. Similarly, if one state government, or one territory, were to allow the free distribution and sale of automatic guns, for example, we would see it as a duty and a responsibility to say, `No. You shall not do this. This is not in the interests of our nation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard people also say&mdash;in fact, I think that it was the member for Hindmarsh and I apologise if I am incorrect&mdash;that it makes the doctor watch a person suffer as that person dies. If a person is suffering physically as he or she dies, all we are doing is allowing the doctor to compound the negligence of his or her actions by assisting that person to die. People should not suffer unduly as they die. That they do suffer unduly is much more frequently a consequence of the failure of the doctor and the medical staff involved to provide sufficient treatment to them. They have not had access to palliative care and they have also not had the kind of psychological and emotional support that they need from their families and from their carers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7335">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hindmarsh also said&mdash;and I presume she referred to me&mdash;that there was a doctor in this parliament who had admitted euthanasia on two occasions. The point that I would like to make there is that I have said publicly on two occasions in my 13 years of practice in medicine that I have given treatments to people which have contributed substantially to the deaths of those people. The intent of the treatment though, was to make sure that those individuals were free of pain. The intent was not to set out to end the lives of those two human beings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that people need to understand that the law can and does on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis make a judgment about the actions of a doctor. The law occasionally makes decisions about a person provoked beyond what is reasonable who then kills another human being. Personally, I think that is the way it ought to remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard many say that there are strict guidelines. The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) referred to them in his address. He referred to this table which I will seek leave to have incorporated into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I think that people need to ask themselves: have you ever met someone who was told three years ago that he or she had three months to live? How many psychiatrists were protecting the welfare and rights of those patients at Chelmsford? If people think that there is a safeguard in having two doctors making a decision about the nature of an illness, and then one psychiatrist, or even two, or 10 psychiatrists, say that a person is in a fit state of mind to have his or her life ended, then I can say they may be well&hyphen;meaning, but they are sadly misguided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Roger Hunt circulated to us all a position statement from the Australian Association for Hospice and Palliative Care which I would also seek leave to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He emphasised several position points of the association. He emphasised that optimal palliative care cannot relieve all pain. I have never denied that. He has emphasised their recognition of a divergence of views and of the fact that some people rationally request euthanasia. But what he did not emphasise to us was the final position point of the society. That is, that due to the inherent risk to individuals and society it opposes all legalisation of euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members for Hindmarsh and Grayndler said, `Get it out in the open.' All I can say is, `Don't make it easier than it already is.' I will paint a picture for you. If I am the only doctor or one of two or three doctors working in a regional or rural centre 100 to 200 kilometres from the nearest base hospital, and if a person is sent to me who has carcinoma of the kidney, bowel cancer or any other disease from they will die and I know they will probably live for another four to six months, it is much easier to make them feel that euthanasia is an appropriate thing to have than for me to get out of bed every second night for the next six months and deliver the kind of care to them which they need. And if you think I am exaggerating, all I can say is that you should have further exposure to the medical profession. Doctors are human beings, just like everyone else, and their failings are those of human beings rather than scientists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have moved into an era of legislative morality, as Hugh Mackay has said. I think we have now gone into a phase where we think there must be a law or a statute that is going to solve all human pain and suffering, and the contemporary problems we have in society. People are quite wrong to say that. Dr Roger Hunt and Professor Peter Singer have based their arguments for euthanasia on three central themes: that it occurs, that it is popular, and that palliative care does not afford relief from all pain. That a proposition is popular does not always make it right. The member for Oxley is popular. Is she right?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7336">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are all going to die, for many people death is a largely hypothetical experience and when they respond to polls what they are in fact saying is: `I do not want to die in pain. I want to die a dignified death.' The law is a blunt instrument; it does not have the finesse to deal with the decisions that are made in relation to the care of those who are dying. The law is about winners and losers. Although it might be appropriate for many of the things in everyday life, it is dismal in dealing with the concepts of fear, expectation, love and dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proponents of voluntary euthanasia focus only on the needs of those individuals they feel ought to be availed of this right. However, my considered opposition to sincere, but misguided, attempts to regulate this area relates to the impact it will have on others. In a world of increasing economic constraints and an ageing population, the vulnerable are so easily manipulated in all kinds of ways. I always remember that when I asked a doctor, `How did the patient agree to have this terrible thing done to them?' he said, `I can talk a patient into having anything.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When news broke of Bob Dent's death under the Territory's euthanasia laws I believe a lot more went with him than his own life. He took the hopes of many people in this country. Every day there is one young Australian who commits suicide and another 50 who try&mdash;and they suffer also from despair. Let us not say, as a nation, that we think death is a legitimate solution for what we think are insurmountable problems. There is always hope. I think euthanasia is not a solution. That it should be advocated is an indictment of the society in which some are incapable of looking beyond their own needs to the protection of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, in the end, a difference between right and wrong. There is a difference between the pets that we cherish and those fellow human beings whom we love, respect and venerate, for in each one lies the essence of our own humanity. Eventually we will all die, and when you witness and you experience the deaths of others you learn a lot about life. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, while presented to the parliament as addressing a national issue, does not make laws for the nation; nor does it uniquely enough draw its authority from the powers of the parliament provided for in section 51 of the Australian constitution, least of all the external affairs power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike with the Tasmanian sexual conduct legislation in 1994, the Australian parliament does not have international obligations or human rights protocols to uphold with regard to voluntary euthanasia. Indeed, quite contrary to much of the public debate about this bill, it does not raise issues of states rights. Self&hyphen;evidently, if its provisions related to any of Australia's six states they would be outside the powers of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That in itself raises an important principle, something much more important than states rights: the democratic rights of the 500,000 Australian citizens living in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. I do not believe that these Australians should have rights different from those of other Australians in the formulation of laws governing voluntary euthanasia. Citizens in the seat of Werriwa, for instance, vote for state parliamentarians to deal with this matter&mdash;as they do, I am sure, in the seat of Menzies and every other federal division. Citizens in Werriwa certainly have not entrusted me with a responsibility or mandate to make special laws for the territories on euthanasia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7339">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The onus in this debate is not on the opponents of the Andrews bill to show that the Northern Territory laws in their substance and detail are perfect. After all, this parliament has no vetting procedure, committee or status for checking the detail of each of the laws of the territory parliaments. Rather, the onus is on the proponents of this bill to show why the federal parliament should make special laws governing euthanasia for the 500,000 citizens of the territories when, explicitly, it cannot apply the same laws to any other Australian citizens. By any test of reason or democracy, such an argument cannot be sustained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) advanced in his second reading speech was an argument that the national parliament has no meaning if it is not involved in life&hyphen;and&hyphen;death issues. What next: a private member's bill to appropriate from the territories their law&hyphen;making powers on issues like abortion and capital punishment? This exposes, of course, that the mover of this bill is not really interested in reason, nor can he be committed to the ideals of democracy. In truth, he is more interested in the rule of God than in the rule of law. The member for Menzies holds out the handful of non&hyphen;Christians supporting his bill as proof that he is not blending church and state. He seeks to defend his own motives by pointing to the motives of others. Nothing could be more irrational.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">History tells us of the folly of governments whenever they have sought to impose the morality of one part of society on a majority of other citizens. An interesting feature of our society in recent decades has been the clear decline of organisations based on hierarchy and coercion. Institutions as diverse as political parties, trade unions, churches and government departments have lost large slabs of public trust. In the global village, authority is having far less success in telling people what to do. This points to the central dilemma of the euthanasia debate. It should not be about forcing terminally ill people to judge life itself through the prism of someone else's moral code. The only way religious questions have ever been successfully dealt with in public policy is by fostering choice. State aid, the most poisonous debate in the nation's history, was only ever resolved by the way in which the Whitlam government offered parents choice in the education of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Terminally ill citizens deserve nothing less than liberty in determining the manner by which their lives might end. Changes in medical technology in this century have given humankind new horizons, both for the extension of life and the hastening of death.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a free society, surely citizens should have the right to decide for themselves if a life without quality is a life worth living. Harnessing medical expertise in such a decision can hardly be regarded as an immoral practice. No rational person would ever want the federal parliament to be used as a court of appeal on conscience issues arising in another jurisdiction. In a matter such as this, where the national parliament does not have international obligations to uphold, politicians in Canberra should not be telling the territory parliaments what to do, let alone telling terminally ill people how to live the last days of their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this debate, I ask: where are all the liberals&mdash;with a small `l'? This is one of the great paradoxes of the bill. Our laws and society accept the authority of doctors to turn off life&hyphen;support machines without the consent or choice of patients. Our medical practices condone the authority of doctors to inject terminally ill people with lethal injections&mdash;as they do most days and nights in Australian hospitals&mdash;without the consent or choice of patients. Our laws and society also accept these practices in another, more sanitised, form&mdash;the so&hyphen;called double <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7340"> effects. Our laws have also decriminalised abortion in each of the states and territories, passing choice and control in the termination of life to pregnant women. So much for the universal sanctity of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why, then, do the member for Menzies and his colleagues wish to strike down the newly established rights of terminally ill people in the Northern Territory? Is it better for doctors, legislators and religious institutions to exercise authority in matters of life and death, than for terminally ill people to also have rights&mdash;to have the ultimate human right to control one's own fate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opponents of euthanasia talk as if it were compulsory, not voluntary. The compulsion, of course, is on their part&mdash;prescribing for others how they might endure the final parts of their life. If terminally ill people&mdash;their bodies riddled with cancer or AIDS, their dignity gone and their loved ones waiting and suffering with them&mdash;decide that euthanasia is the right choice, then I say, `Let that be their decision. Let that be their choice, not the choice and decision of people they have never known who sit in the federal parliament.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his second reading speech, the member for Menzies spoke of his personal experience in watching loved ones die. While for each of us this is one of the saddest parts of life, I would suggest that, no matter our compassion, no matter our love, watching is somewhat different to feeling&mdash;to feeling at first&hyphen;hand a serious illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say something of how I feel personally about voluntary euthanasia. As an MP, I acknowledge that it has never been simple for society to establish new rights of freedom and liberty. I admire the Northern Territory parliament for being bold and considerate enough to pioneer laws which seek to enhance the rights and liberties of terminally ill people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a different level in my life, a defining experience on these issues of morality and mortality was when I had cancer two years ago. It convinced me, with clarity and passion, that feeling is very different indeed to watching. I learnt a lot from that time. The experience taught me many things: to enjoy more fully the simple things in life; to value and advance, as best I can in my finite time, the things I believe to be worth advocating; but most of all, as one deals with both living and perhaps ending life, that nothing matters more than having control of the choices, liberties and freedoms which ultimately make a human life worthwhile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliamentary debate, in the saddest of ways from my perspective, has also taught me something. That is, just how hard it can be&mdash;despite the best theories and intent of our system of governance&mdash;for politicians to establish new sources of liberty. Ultimately, liberty and freedom rely on someone else letting go of authority. Too often, through history, citizens have been forced to secure their rights through non&hyphen;democratic means. Now, the House of Representatives&mdash;by a large majority, I fear&mdash;is about to take away the rights of terminally ill people in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the culture of our parliament, with its adversarial style, its parties and factions, its ambitions and personal struggles, the exercise of authority has in large part become a basic instinct. The exercise of power brings with it the cascading emotions of recognition and authority. Within such a culture, it is not easy to give power and authority away. It is not easy to transfer the right of the parliamentarian to tell people how to live or how to end their lives, to the rights of the individual to freely make their own choices. It is not easy to give liberty to others; it shifts control, judgment and, at times, status from the decision makers of a parliament to the decisions of each citizen.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7341">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why I have always been interested in Ghandi's dictum that in public life, real power comes from giving power away. I hold this to be true with regard to the powers of the Northern Territory parliament and with regard to the power of terminally ill people to decide what is right and what is best for themselves. In the name of democracy, but most of all, for the cause of liberty and the rights of citizens in a free society, I urge the House and the committee to reject this private member's bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like at the outset to congratulate the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) for having brought forward this private member's bill, and to indicate very clearly my strong support for it. It seems to me that it takes both courage and persistence to achieve much in this place. Not everyone who comes here has much of either of these qualities. But, I think that the member for Menzies has demonstrated that he does and I congratulate him for the action he has taken, despite subtle and overt opposition, not only in this place, but outside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of things that underpin the great democracy that we have: freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of religion, and other things. But one of the underpinning tenets of our democracy is that we give people and guarantee people the right to live. I believe that this national government is ultimately the guardian of the human rights of our citizens and so we have a responsibility, I believe, to be involved in this debate. I strongly contend that we ought to be involved in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There must be a national response on this issue. The suggestion that one state could have different laws about this is, in my view, quite untenable. We have arguments about these issues of uniformity quite often: uniform company laws, road laws, and systems of education. But ultimately, if there were an argument for uniform laws on anything, this would have to be it. The prospect of `euthanasia tourism', as it is called, ought not to be taken lightly. I put it to you, as a representative of an electorate on a border, that this is a serious issue when there could be different laws on each side of the border.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So states' rights, in my view, are not the issue here and if they were, I must observe them as others have. For those who are the strongest proponents of states' rights in this issue, it would be instructive to examine where they voted on the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, or, indeed, for those who were not here when we considered that debate who have spoken strongly about states' rights, where they would have voted, if they had have been here on that bill. And the answer, of course, is self evident. It is the reason that states' rights is not the issue. The issue is euthanasia. That is ultimately what we are talking about here and that point, of course, has been made by many others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier today, a fine line was referred to by a member from South Australia between the law there and the law in the Northern Territory. It is not a fine line. It is a chasm between the law which allows doctors to make decisions about the treatment of their patients which may result in the hastening of the death of that patient, and a law which actually empowers doctors to kill patients. There is a chasm between the laws in South Australia and other states and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many opponents of euthanasia, though not all, are opposed to euthanasia on religious grounds. This is a stumbling block for those who have not got religious beliefs, and it is an easy point of criticism of those of us that do have religious beliefs. They accuse us of crossing that line which is not clear but which exists&mdash;quite properly in a lot of respects&mdash;between church and state. Or they stoop to accuse us because we have religious views of attempting <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7342"> to impose those views on others. This is not, I might observe, an easy place for those who have strong views, even indeed for those who have religious views. We are required, it seems to me on occasions, to bow down before the god of politics and there are consequences here in this place for those who refuse to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, this debate about euthanasia ultimately, and perhaps inevitably, boils down to one's view of life and, therefore, one's theology. There will be people here who claim to have none, and yet, as the member for Lalor (Mr Jones) observed, in a sense by default, one has one whether one wants one or not. Ultimately, any intelligent person at some point&mdash;maybe when they are in the outback at night staring up at the stars&mdash;asks fundamental questions like, `What am I doing here? What is life all about? Where am I going?' If one dismisses all that as irrelevant, then at least one has made a decision of sorts about those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fully understand the view of the secularists or humanists on this issue. If you do not accept the sovereignty of God, however difficult a concept that might be, then euthanasia is the ultimate in terms of controlling one's destiny. It is a logical response. If one takes that humanist view of life, then euthanasia would be fairly easy and logical to follow. Others who are opposed to this bill I expect are not doing so for theological or religious reasons. They can argue accordingly. I am interested in hearing their arguments as they propound them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also say, because it has been put to me by constituents who have consulted me on this issue, that human beings are not animals. Once again, that is a religious perspective. That is a theological perspective. People say to me, `If my cat got knocked over by a car and it was suffering, I would have it put down.' If one has a concept of God's sovereignty or even of the existence of God, one has to understand quite clearly that man&mdash;human beings, homo sapiens&mdash;are created distinctly different, and with a different ultimate purpose in life and a different destiny, from one's cat or dog or horse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The views of my constituents on this issue, as on other issues, are important to me. The support that I have had for the anti&hyphen;euthanasia position has been overwhelming. I suspect that there has been a very orchestrated attempt to portray that view, because I still get people telling me that the overall majority of people are actually in favour of euthanasia. However, ultimately I must make my own decision about this matter and about other matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am elected here as a member of the Liberal Party, though I take the point made by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) that I am certainly not a small `l' liberal. But I am also here as an individual. I am here as the individual that I am, whether people like that or not&mdash;and, clearly, a number do not. The fact is that, as a member of the Lyons Forum, which the member for Werriwa throws at me as often as he gets the opportunity, I uphold the biblical ideal of family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is anathema to some who do not share those views. So my position on euthanasia is at its essence&mdash;the bottom line&mdash;a theological perspective. I cannot separate that from my overall view of life. Whilst the views of my constituents on this issue and on others are important, they have ultimately elected me as I am, and I believe I am required to provide leadership on a number of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of my constituents agree with everything said by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson)&mdash;perhaps more people in my electorate than in many others. Graeme Campbell's Australia First Party is alive and well in my electorate. But I have contended with the member for Oxley on most issues because I believe she has been wrong and ill&hyphen;informed. When my <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7343"> constituents phone me and tell me that if I do not get on her side I will be out at the next election, I say, `So be it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley has put forward views which are, in many respects, anathema to my view of life. I believe in a compassionate response to our indigenous people. I understand that because of their degree of disadvantage they need special treatment. Despite the fact that many of my constituents tell me that those views are inconsistent with my prospects of re&hyphen;election, that is not a concern to me ultimately. I have the same view on multiculturalism, immigration and overseas aid. I argue strongly for a compassionate response from a country as well endowed as ours towards those who are very much less well endowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My position on euthanasia is one of strong support for the Andrews bill. I have placed on the record my commendation for and admiration of him. I believe that this bill will be carried, I believe that it ought to be carried, and I believe that that will be ultimately the right thing for this parliament to have done in the interests of our citizens.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been put in a difficult position regarding the member for Menzies' private member's bill, but I have to support the reasoning behind it. The wording of the bill is, in effect, amending a state bill which I do not believe is warranted and which abrogates state rights on the issue. But, the topic of this bill and its intent, which is in the language of the bill, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Subject to this section the power of the Legislative Assembly conferred by section 6 in relation to the making of laws does not extend to the making of laws which permit or have the effect of permitting (whether subject to conditions or not) the form of intentional killings of another called euthanasia (which includes mercy killing) or the assisting of a person to terminate his or her life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Legislative Assembly does have power to make laws with respect to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">   (a) the withdrawal or withholding of medical or surgical measures for prolonging the life of a patient but not so as to permit the intentional killing of the patient; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">   (b) medical treatment in the provision of palliative care to a dying patient, but not so as to permit the intentional killing of the patient.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not in favour of the Commonwealth influencing states' rights on the passing of legislation, but this is an issue that is national, if not global, in its implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had many letters from all over Australia as, no doubt, have all other members within the parliament. The letters came from organisations, church groups and ordinary individuals who want to have their input and their views registered. The majority of the ones I have received are from those who oppose legislation for euthanasia. Some do not oppose euthanasia, per se, but it is having legislation in place to allow a group of people to make a decision about whether a person with a terminal or chronic illness should be put to sleep. They are concerned that it could easily go wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have enormous problems with the concept. Out of hundreds of letters received, one from Dr Colleen McCullough impressed me when she posed a number of questions. She asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it moral or ethical for a government to contemplate legislative action which inevitably incorporates an element of saving large amounts of taxpayers' money when it simultaneously deprives other taxpayers of life? Is this motive genuinely founded in humanitarian principles, or is it a result of cold&hyphen;blooded economic necessity?</PARA>
<PARA>She echoed my own feelings, but puts them in much better words than I possibly can because that is the issue that I believe is driving some of this debate. In fact, it chilled me when I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7344"> received a letter from Western Australia asking me to vote against this bill on the grounds that, as it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the loss of dignity, futile suffering and despair, caused by watching the loved family suffer as they watch their relations suffer, while powerless to help and all to prolong life which has no quality, is cruel, heartless and a shocking waste of taxpayers' money.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that this person needs to think about the long&hyphen;term implications of what is a waste of money and what is not. To think about life in money terms is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back to Dr McCullough, who is now a full&hyphen;time writer, she worked with the terminally ill over a period of 20 years and has witnessed, as she says, `the full gamut of human suffering.' At the conclusion of her thoughts on the matter, which she addressed to the New South Wales parliament, she summed up well what I also believe about the debate. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To kill life is to kill hope, and hope is what keeps most of humanity going. Hope that things will be better. Win the lottery, back the right horse, inherit a fortune. That a cure will be found for Alzheimers, AIDS, cancer. That the recipe will be found to regenerate central nervous system tissue. That we will all live to a healthy thousand . . . than a healthy hundred. Which leads to the only proper conclusion. While there's life there's hope.</PARA>
<PARA>Today in Tasmania we are suffering huge cuts to our hospital system, to health programs and to the community health areas. The federal government has cut $20 million this year and the state government is removing $30 million from its budget and people are having to pay large sums of money to get into nursing home care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is an individual who cares for a family going to be forced into the decision of `turning off the light' because that person feels the family cannot afford to look after them and they do not want to be a burden on their family? It is a real thing. I hear older people talking about it, especially if their family is trying to find suitable space for them to be properly cared for, but finding that there is nothing available as all spaces are filled. Should we treat our families in this uncaring way? No, we should not. It is vital that money be available and properly allocated for palliative care. If those who are in pain, or are terribly stressed by their illness, have proper care, pain&hyphen;killers and a soothing, peaceful environment, life can be bearable and life can have hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand why people argue for the option to use euthanasia, and I know in certain circumstances it will and does happen. But the Northern Territory bill is not about discontinuing futile or heroic treatment; it is not about the refusal of burdensome and unwanted medical attention; it is not about the provision of pain&hyphen;relieving, modern palliative care. It is about the use of a lethal injection to bring about the immediate death of another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments could choose to bypass a caring response for all dying people to legislate to assist the suicide of a few. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Tasmanian</EMPHASIS>, on 27 October 1996, had an article from Dr Christopher Newell. It talked about his experiences with chronic pain, acute respiratory disorder and a lack of mobility and a quality of life. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have so many disabilities it's not funny. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thought I was useless and a burden. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I perceived myself very much as an economic burden and a useless lump of no use whatsoever to my family whom I thought I was damaging being alive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I could see no future in any meaningful relationship because nobody would want me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was in deep depression and wanted someone to kill me. I desperately wanted to die. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7345">  </PARA>
<PARA>This is from a 32&hyphen;year&hyphen;old male with numerous disabilities, who just happens to be the eldest son of the Anglican Bishop of Tasmania. Four years on from this feeling that he had, Christopher is now married, the father of three daughters, senior lecturer in the division of community and rural health at the university and a private consultant in human services and ethics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What changed? It was not his health. That is much the same, though probably it is managed much more than it used to be and in a better way. But it is his attitude and the view of himself that has changed. Things became brighter because the people around him who cared, who gave him a reason for wanting to continue to be part of humanity, had given him hope. Thank you, Dr Newell, for sharing that very powerful experience of life. Hope is a very powerful tool in survival!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Euthanasia does not allow you to make a mistake and say, `Oops, sorry, I really didn't mean that. I do want to live after all.' I wonder how many people will have seen the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shine</EMPHASIS>. It has nothing to do with euthanasia, but it is about hope and achievement of a person with disabilities which may well have gone the other way if someone had not cared enough to try and give quality of life back. It is those people with disabilities who would be affected most when things go wrong with such legislation as euthanasia laws. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will enter this debate for a very short time. I want to compliment all my colleagues&mdash;both from the coalition and Labor&mdash;on the speeches they have presented in this debate. Those who are arguing for and against the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 have done so very lucidly. I would like to compliment the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), for his contribution this morning. I found it very interesting and very informative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Lalor said, this debate has been pretty hard to think about because there are two issues. One is a moral issue, which is clear, and the other is a states' rights issue. States' rights do not mean much to Victorians. But they certainly do to Western Australians and that issue is a major problem for me with this debate. I have been fighting over those issues and I thought that what I should be doing, as a marginal seat member, was getting some advice from my electorate as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I went out into my electorate, spoke to 250 community groups, and asked them to debate and vote on the issue. I have had responses from the majority of those. I also went out and sought advice from a whole range of different constituents. I looked at all the mail that came to my office and took out all the standard replies from both sides of the argument. I had put the Gallus argument, the Dondas argument, the Andrews argument and the Abetz argument to the electorate. I got a fair bit of response and it was overwhelmingly one way&mdash;and from Western Australia, it surprised me. That is, they want me to support the bill. That is what I will be doing. Thank you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(11.58 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of factors that any parliamentarian has to face in this debate. Let me state from the outset that I do not think this is a matter of states' rights. I say that because, under our constitution, the Commonwealth has very defined powers and the states have reserve powers. If this legislation had been passed by the legislature of New South Wales or that of my own home state we would not be going through this debate now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, for all practical purposes, we have got used to the fact that these issues&mdash;which go to the issues of how you run your police force, your licensing laws, whether you have registered <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7346"> brothels or how you handle questions of prostitution or drugs&mdash;are things which fall within the reserve powers in our concept of state responsibilities. For practical purposes, the Commonwealth has in the past treated the Northern Territory as a state. There is a legal argument that it is not properly a state, but the fact is that it has its own elected assembly and they have debated this issue up hill and down dale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state, there was a very significant debate on how we handle the question of drugs. I would have preferred to have seen the Victorian legislature go further than it did in its response to its report on the issue. But I would not argue with the right to determine the decision that they made. Certainly, as a federal parliamentarian, my right intercede in that matter cannot be argued. States do not have rights; Australian citizens have rights. And Australian citizens encompass the citizens of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former minister in this place, I spent much of my time in litigation with the Northern Territory government. At no stage did I ever argue&mdash;although I disagreed with the positions they were taking on issues like land rights&mdash;that they did not have the right to argue that way and to go to the High Court and argue their position. We have now dredged up a legal argument&mdash;probably a correct legal argument&mdash;that the Northern Territory is not a state in terms of legal concepts. That is probably true because at the moment there is a problem with how they deal with the question of how many senators they should have. We cannot have it both ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this was Commonwealth legislation, I do not know that I would vote for it because Australia, from my experience, comprises regions. The attitudes of people in Far North Queensland in relation to certain questions are not the same as those of people in the metropolitan capitals of Sydney and Melbourne. There is a distinct set of attitudes within the Northern Territory on a whole range of issues. They do not necessarily think like people in Melbourne or Adelaide. Their elected representatives have argued their way through this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to areas of social experimentation which enlarge human rights as distinct from reduce them and where there are decisions to make, who am I to say that we cannot trust these elected representatives. We cannot say, `There might be abuses as a result of this process. It might have these adverse social effects. We do not have enough confidence in you to say, as a group of elected Australian representatives, "You won't deal with those abuses if they arise."' Perhaps if we are dealing with important areas of social experimentation, the best thing the Commonwealth can do is leave that area of experimentation alone and see how it works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is an attempt by those people to manipulate the legislators&mdash;and they are quite candid about it. Because of their deeply held religious convictions, they believe they have a moral right to impose their moral and religious imperatives upon an elected assembly. I do not accept that argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe I have the right, because of my religious beliefs or my lack thereof, to say that I am going to gather around me the Lyons Forum&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;and then, because of those religious beliefs, tell a democratically elected assembly what to do. It is an elected assembly whose political concepts I disagree with in many ways, but it having been democratically elected, I accept it is operating in a jurisdiction which is within the general ambit of their rights, and I believe that intervention creates a dangerous precedent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe I have the right to tell people, irrespective of their religious beliefs or their lack thereof, who are suffering a terminal disease and are in pain and need assistance so that they can press a button to end their pain that they cannot do that. I believe that if people want <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7347"> to die in dignity surrounded by their loved ones and end what has been a painful experience for all of them, I do not have the right to say that, because I have a certain religious beliefs, they cannot do that. Therefore, I will vote against this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this legislation is ill conceived. I think it is an abuse of the powers of this parliament. I believe it is an unwarranted interference with a legislature which, in terms of social experimentation, ought to have no fewer rights than any of the states. If the government of Victoria or the government of New South Wales had introduced this legislation, we would not dream of intervening. I believe the Commonwealth is entitled to intervene where there is legislation which restricts and limits human freedom and human rights. But this is legislation which gives Australian citizens who are in a desperate situation a right of choice. Many will not exercise that choice because of their religious beliefs, but others will because of their commitment to their family and their belief in what is a highly personal decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that any member of this parliament, whatever his religious beliefs, has got the right to say, `I will tell a fellow Australian citizen how he will choose to die'. If this legislation had come before the Commonwealth parliament, I might well have voted against it, because I do not know that the Australian community as a whole should move down this track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But on any view of it, this is an important decision that has been made within the parameters of a democratically elected assembly. I believe that if abuses arise, that assembly will be more than capable of dealing with them. You can take the option of applying a rule which says that that goes with the concept of state government&mdash;and the territory is moving toward state government, as is Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to experiment in these ways, there is a strong argument for saying, `Let it take place on a narrow basis, in a confined area, and let us see how it works'. If this is an experiment which enlarges the rights of Australian citizens, it should not be interfered with in the way in which it is being interfered with by members of this parliament on the basis of their deeply held religious beliefs. For that reason, I will be voting against this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

I did not thank him because, frankly, he put me in a position I did not want to be in. He put me in a position whereby I had to make a decision about something I did not want publicly to make a decision on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, the debate having ventured to this point in time, I think the parliament is richer for this debate. It is richer for the way in which we as individual members have been forced to confront this decision. Frankly, it has forced us to ask ourselves how much we know, or how much we fail to know, about life's fundamental questions. Where did we come from? Am I merely the product of a passionate moment between my parents, or am I in fact someone with a destiny? I do not know the answer to that. Why am I here? That is the question that everyone asks themselves all the time, and I do not know the answer to that either. Where am I going? I do not have the answer to that question. In fact, I think it is fortunate that I do not know <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7348"> the answer to those fundamental questions, because my view of life is that it is those questions that make life worth living, and the mystery is part of the perfection of being here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am here, participating in this debate, quite frankly rightly branded by the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) as prejudiced by my own experiences, by my own upbringing, by the people I have known, and by my religious persuasion. I can bring nothing else into this debate. I am not at all affronted by the fact that the member for Menzies has introduced this dilemma into the parliament, because I do not see it as interventionist. He has a perfect right to introduce a private member's bill and I therefore have a right and an obligation as an individual&mdash;influenced by, as I said, my own upbringing, the people I have known and my religious persuasion&mdash;to vote as I see fit. My view of life is that life is a gift, that everyone has a right to live, and that life is all that matters in our society today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know that I come into this debate able to participate from a particularly informed point of view because, to borrow the title of at least one famous book, I have had a fortunate life. I have never actually fronted the reality of a loved one suffering. My father passed away 10 days after a heart attack, but that hardly bears any resemblance to the sort of debate we are having here. I am not someone who has had to deal with the question of euthanasia and whether it would be kinder to minimise the suffering that a loved one was experiencing. But I am someone who has had a rather rare experience that has influenced the way I feel about the Andrews legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One night, many years ago, a colleague of mine, who happened to be a minister of religion in the small country town in which I lived, rang me because he believed his three&hyphen;year&hyphen;old daughter was dying. Three hours earlier she had been suffering, they thought, simply from influenza. Her condition was clearly misdiagnosed. It was an experience I would gladly have avoided, but I actually spent that evening with him while he waited for the ambulance to come some distance. Ultimately, she passed on while the doctor was attempting, in a futile exercise, to keep her alive. I wondered what would happen to that gentleman because of his profession and because of his attitude to life. The astonishing thing to me in that experience was that he would clearly gladly have given anything, even his own life, to spare his daughter that suffering. We can all identify with that sentiment. Because of that experience&mdash;I know it is true even today&mdash;he has been quite a remarkable, for want of a better word, witness for other people because of the experience he had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I came out of that experience aware of the fact that there are some things in life we cannot escape and that there are some experiences in life that we would give anything to avoid, but that life is not necessarily poorer because they happened. We only really know how to love people because we are conscious of what loneliness is all about. We only really know how to provide for people and how to make provision for future problems because we are conscious of what hunger is all about. We only really have an obsession with health because we know what illness is all about. I want to put it to the gathering in this Main Committee that part of what gives life its meaning is the grim reality of suffering. I wish it were avoidable, but it is not. We do society a great disservice when we imagine that in the 20th century we can eliminate all that is uncomfortable. Life is actually richer because of the things that we would give anything to avoid. Our whole concept of palliative care&mdash;which in many ways is an illustration of human beings at the cutting edge of scientific research&mdash;is more meaningful simply because of the grim reality of suffering and death.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7349">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not suggesting that suffering is something that we should welcome; you all know me better than that. I am saying that what is wrong with the present attitude to euthanasia is that it suggests that suffering is something we can avoid. In my view, life becomes more meaningful because of the dilemmas we face, such as suffering, hunger, loneliness and illness. My dilemma with euthanasia is that it offers a convenient escape from life when life is about confronting those things that we would like to avoid. One of the dilemmas for us in the 20th century is that in the society of which I am a part  grandparents are placed in nursing homes, so the deterioration of old age is unknown. Pets are conveniently put down by vets, so the suffering which previous generations were once familiar with is now largely unknown. As a result of that, many of us find ourselves, in my view, relatively ill&hyphen;equipped to deal with this fundamental question in life&mdash;which is death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a dilemma with euthanasia. My dilemma is that it allows us to escape that reality that life is the richer for the confronting, and it allows the state to sanction killing which is something that I cannot condone. The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) suggested that, in some ways, our participation in this debate was the poorer because we had brought into it our own religious prejudices. My view is that that is inevitable. Everyone comes into this debate with an attitude that is clearly a reflection of the experiences he or she has had, or failed to have, or that he or she has seen other people facing. I make no apology for that. I am in here making a difficult choice that is, of course, clearly, the result of my own prejudices. It is a choice that I feel I can responsibly make because I am an elected member of parliament, asked by my electors to do what I think is right, not necessarily what is popular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many have suggested that what the parliament is doing here runs counter to the popular opinion of the community at large. Quite frankly, I doubt that. In spite of the indications to the contrary&mdash;and I am not so gullible as to be influenced by the number of letters I have had because I am sure the letters reflect what we would politically call `a soft majority beside a hard minority'. My experience in my electorate has been that this is a question on which my electorate is divided on a largely 50&hyphen;50 basis. There are some who favour the territory legislation, and an equal number who would favour what Kevin Andrews is proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I happen to think that this is not a matter for states' rights. I understand the concerns of the member for the Northern Territory. But all of the evidence that we have is that, clearly, this is a matter that concerns the Northern Territory, and it is entirely proper and responsible, therefore, for the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) to move his private member's bill, and for each of us to deal with it as we see fit. Because I cannot personally endorse a concept in which the state sanctions killing, and because I think the capacity to be able to choose that option makes society poorer, I find myself in support of the Menzies' bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution today will, I hope, underline not only the fact that I intend to vote against this legislation, but my reasons for doing so. They are strongly held reasons, and they turn around what I think is a very important principle that is being ignored in bringing this legislation before the parliament. If I can put it very simply and, indeed, quote someone else's words, because I think they are compelling, and if the women of Australia will forgive me for the masculine pronoun, I think it says very clearly what it is that I object to. Professor Ronald Dworkin, in 1993 said, I think, compellingly:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Making someone die in a way that others approve, but he regards as a horrifying contradiction of his life, is a devastating, odious form of tyranny. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7350">  </PARA>
<PARA>I would put it as strongly as that myself. And one of the things that concerns me about this legislation is the fact that it is part of what I would call a growing conservative obsession with legislating against choice, of trying to hustle what is a grave moral decision which is inherently personal into the domain of public law. I partially quote Robert Hughes, in his essay, `The culture of complaint' in making that observation. But, again, it is an observation which I strongly endorse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer briefly to the statement of the honourable Marshall Perron, who was then the member for Fannie Bay, in the Northern Territory. In his executive summary of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Bill he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the law as it stands actively ensures that many doctors will not intervene to assist patients to end their suffering because of fear of legal action&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I intend to return to that point in a minute&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I think that it is important for its opponents to realise this about the Northern Territory legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">does no more than formalise and decriminalise a practice which occasionally occurs now but a practice for which some patients regrettably cannot find sympathetic doctors prepared to risk their careers and liberty.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess that is not surprising. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is about personal choice. It does not provide carte blanche for euthanasia. It contemplates no externally imposed end of life decisions for the aged, the disabled or for anyone else. In simple language, it provides mentally competent, terminally ill patients with the right to choose to shorten their agony peacefully and with dignity. It is restricted solely to adult patients who are terminally ill and able to make a judgement for themselves after advice from their doctor.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I will return to that last point later because, at the moment, some decisions are made for and on behalf of patients but without reference to their desire and belief. In my view, that was partly what Mr Perron was trying to avoid in his legislation, trying to overturn what, at the moment, is often a decision made by a doctor or doctors without necessarily having the right intention. In other words, the patient may not have decided that he or she wants to die, but the doctors may have found it more convenient to decide that he or she should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will briefly touch on one issue before I turn to my substantive arguments. This is the question of the community view on this matter. I think that, as members of parliament, we are certainly entitled to a conscience vote on key issues but we should also take account of the views of the community. This is one area where, for over a decade, for as along as the question has been asked of the community, and in whatever form, somewhere between seven and eight out of 10 Australians say that they favour euthanasia, described in the terms that it was and, indeed, is legislated in Marshall Perron's bill. It is not something that is changed as a result of debate or argument, publicity or lack of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very strongly held view. I might say, incidentally, that a significant minority of people with strong religious beliefs, and that includes Catholics, also have a view that euthanasia&mdash;in the terms described by a competent adult terminally ill making a decision about his or her own life&mdash;is justified. So, in many cases, even those people with the strongest religious convictions support the availability of the choice about this key matter in a person's life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the arguments on euthanasia, they tend to be centred on four main issues: firstly, the question of religious belief; secondly, the question of the decisions that need to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7351"> made by medical practitioners&mdash;the ethics surrounding end of life decisions, if you like; thirdly, the rights of the individual versus the common good; and finally, the value of human life. If you look at the religious considerations, I respect the views of those who are religious and who see it in the same way as the Anglican Catholic bishops in their submission to the House of Lords. They said, `Life is to be viewed as His'&mdash;that is God's&mdash;`gift, given and taken according to His sovereign will. It is thus not at the disposal of any human being.' That is fine if you share that belief and I can understand people with strong religious beliefs endorsing that sentiment, but for many of those in the community&mdash;and I believe the majority&mdash;who do not share those views, it simply is not relevant to invoke God's will and God's gift of life because they simply do not share the belief. So, invoking religious arguments is only good enough for those people who share their beliefs. It is not sufficient grounds for the rest of the community to agree that euthanasia is somehow in breach of a universally held belief about the existence of God because it requires the individual to make a decision,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the medical considerations, the profession itself makes a very fine distinction between the methods that they might use to relieve pain, which may inevitably lead to death&mdash;distinguishing those means of allowing a patient to die, from agreeing to take part in assisting a patient to die. A great many organisations, including the AMA, do not support what they call active euthanasia but they are quite happy, indeed, to participate in passive euthanasia. I might say that, at times, and I have this on first&hyphen;hand experience having worked in a medical faculty for some time, those decisions are not made with reference to the patients. It is decided that that person is in pain, that the palliative care is no longer working and, therefore, they will increase the dose of whatever pain&hyphen;killer is available until such time as the patient dies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, when you ask people about the euthanasia question, they are often less enthusiastic about that doctor determined decision than they are about the one they make themselves. It is difficult to expand on that important point in a short time, but I have the view that it is not good enough to make this distinction between active and passive euthanasia from the point of view of the patient. So&hyphen;called passive euthanasia often takes away the dignity and choice that he or she would wish. Whether the doctor intends or merely allows death, it seems to me is not a distinction that makes a great deal of sense from the point of view of the person&mdash;the patient or his family and friends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the individual versus the common good, a lot of people would argue that, while it may be reasonable for the individual to ask to die on their own terms, it is not in the interests of society as a whole. Under this heading, you often get the thin edge of the wedge arguments that, if you allow the state to intervene in taking a person's life, it will open the floodgates of things such as the murders&mdash;and I do not call it euthanasia&mdash;undertaken during the Nazi regime of people with intellectual, physical and mental illness. Euthanasia does not contemplate that. It contemplates the individual making the decision not the state. So, in fact, it is precisely the opposite situation to that where the state intervenes to take a patient's life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just ask members to contemplate this scenario. Doctors A and B, I will call them for the moment, are in all respects similar. They are caring, respected doctors with impeccable backgrounds. Dr A's patient, Mr X, is suffering from a fatal illness which is now in its final stages. He is near death and in great pain and he has asked the doctor to put him out of his misery. Dr A explains that he cannot do so but he will steadily increase the amount of pain&hyphen;relieving drugs. The effect of this will be that, over a period of time&mdash;perhaps a few days&mdash;the dose will be such that Mr X will in fact die, albeit, he adds, as a consequence of his attempt to relieve pain. Two days later Mr X does indeed die.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7352">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrast that with Dr B's patient, a Mrs Z, who is in virtually the same situation. In response to her entreaties, Dr B says that he will give her something to bring about the release she seeks and injects her accordingly. She dies within minutes without pain and suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now according to the traditional moral principle in this individual versus common good reference to passive euthanasia, Dr A would have performed a permissible act and Dr B would not. Currently it is not uncommon for palliative care, for life-sustaining treatment, to be withheld by doctors with the primary intention of ending a patient's life. I think that is a much more damaging failure by the state to intervene to protect patients against a decision that they may or may not have been party to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An often quoted fear is that legally sanctioned, assisted dying would threaten the lives of powerless and vulnerable people. Again, as I say, if it is properly legislated, if there are constraints on the doctors' behaviour, that is less likely, not more likely, to happen. And doctors are less likely to make decisions based on extraneous factors such as the level of disability, the cost to the community and other matters that really should not be at the forefront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, it is often argued that euthanasia devalues human life and that human life, however, should be measured only in terms of its longevity. I would argue that quality is critical, and one of the key things that determines the quality of life for any individual is the ability, within limits, to control one's own life, to maintain a sense of authority over one's own destiny. If that is important while one is healthy and fit and able to make clear decisions, how much more important is it at that moment when the question is, `Do I want to continue to live or not?' I think every citizen deserves the right to determine the moment and means of their going in a dignified and civilised fashion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already expressed my views about where this debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 should be held. It is deplorable that 10 minutes only is allowed to express a view on a matter such as this and that the people of Australia cannot hear it and see it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My views have been influenced by the following: extensive input from constituents and the people of Australia; numerous discussions with people of all viewpoints; reading widely; lengthy experience as a barrister, having appeared in many criminal cases and cases involving wills; and knowledge that no country has formally legalised euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to the 1994 report by the House of Lords committee. This committee was composed of people from both sides of the debate. It took evidence from a broad spectrum of people. The committee visited the Netherlands where euthanasia, voluntary and non&hyphen;voluntary, is practised. It sets a very high hurdle for those upon whom the onus of proof is cast to persuade me and the community that what is now unlawful should be authorised, justified or excused by law. That is, one person can in particular circumstances lawfully kill another by a deliberate act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a barrister, I have seen and participated in endless cases considering whether confessions have been voluntary. I have observed at first hand the precarious position of persons under a disability by virtue of their inequality of bargaining power or due to age or infirmity. I have seen the fear of these people of those under whose influence or authority they have come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the criminal courts an irrefutable case of a voluntary confession has turned out to be involuntary after full and complete argument on the evidence. In civil courts, wills have turned out to be invalid in the face of obvious written documentation to the contrary. It is much <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7353"> harder to upset a valid will, for the person who has executed the will is deceased and cannot say whether the document was voluntary or involuntary or whether it was executed in circumstances that were unfair or whether the person was the subject of undue influence or pressure or duress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take a real case. A lady in her nineties was cruelly practised upon by her son. She had been living in her home and, during the last 18 months to two years of her life, was removed to a nursing home that he and his wife were running. During the period that she lived in that home, she changed her will leaving her house to her son. She had previously left the house to her son and daughter. Not long before she died, she wrote a note on a little torn piece of Christmas wrapping. It was tied tightly in a handkerchief. It was smuggled by her to her great&hyphen;nephew. She wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They made me sign over the house to them. But please destroy this. They have not treated me too good, but please destroy this.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>She was terrified when she furtively passed him the note. What appeared a voluntary and fair will was, by luck and good fortune, discovered to be involuntary and unfair. This is one example of many, and it is on the word `voluntary' and by the words of the Northern Territory act itself that the case for euthanasia founders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument about the Northern Territory legislation has been considered in an article on the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act by Karin Clarke, a solicitor. Time does not permit me to go into it, but I recommend that article to all honourable members and to the people of Australia. I believe that the legislation in the Northern Territory is incapable of protecting&mdash;wholly, solely and beyond any reasonable doubt&mdash;those persons who subject themselves to euthanasia so that their choice is in fact a voluntary one. I will quote from paragraphs 238 and 239 of the report of the House of Lords:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we do not think it possible to set secure limits on voluntary euthanasia. Some witnesses told us that to legalise voluntary euthanasia was a discrete step which need have no other consequences. But as we said in our introduction, issues of life and death do not lend themselves to clear definition, and without that it would not be possible to frame adequate safeguards against non&hyphen;voluntary euthanasia if voluntary euthanasia were to be legalised. It would be next to impossible to ensure that all acts of euthanasia were truly voluntary, and that any liberalisation was not abused. Moreover to create an exception to the general prohibition of intentional killing would inevitably open the way to its further erosion whether by design, by inadvertence, or by the human tendency to test the limits of any regulation. These dangers are such that we believe that any decriminalisation of voluntary euthanasia would give rise to more, and more grave, problems than those it sought to address. Fear of what some witnesses referred to as a "slippery slope" could in itself be damaging.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are also concerned that vulnerable people&mdash;the elderly, lonely, sick or distressed&mdash;would feel pressure, whether real or imagined, to request early death. We accept that, for the most part, requests resulting from such pressure or from remediable depressive illness would be identified as such by doctors and managed appropriately. Nevertheless we believe that the message which society sends to vulnerable and disadvantaged people should not, however obliquely, encourage them to seek death, but should assure them of our care and support in life.</PARA>
<PARA>There is much confusion about rights. There is no right in law, in fact, morally or in any other way, to die. A person is at liberty to kill himself, but that is not a right. To establish the existence of a right there must be residing in another person a correlating duty either to do, or to refrain from exercising a power. That is, a right bespeaks a duty. There is no duty residing in anyone to kill somebody, but there is a duty to refrain from killing someone. There is a right to have one's life preserved, but there is no right to die. I have a right not to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7354"> killed by someone. That right exists because there is a duty residing in that person not to kill me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one considers the issue of states' rights as an argument, it is an intoxicating thought that, of all parliaments in the democratic world, one alone shines as a beacon&mdash;is at the forefront of unparalleled wisdom and understanding. Which parliament is that? Is it the House of Commons, representing more than 70 million people? Is it Congress, representing more than 280 million people? Is it any of the great recognised parliaments of the democratic world? Not a bit of it. An assembly representing the number of people residing in the Shire of Pine Rivers in my electorate alone possesses that clarity of foresight and human understanding that can decide by a bare majority so vital an issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does affect every person in Australia, not just the Northern Territorians. It is curious that the Northern Territory Assembly has not appreciated this. If it had it might have thought to consult much more widely than it did. That assembly has chosen to ignore all of the major reports from Canada, the United States, the House of Lords committee in England, and so on. The argument about states' rights is untenable and section 122 of the constitution settles this matter. This parliament has a pre&hyphen;eminent duty to protect the life of every Australian citizen. It should not, and must not, shrink from that responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some speakers against the bill have demonstrated a misunderstanding of where the onus of proof lies. They have declared that individual rights ought not to be interfered with by the supporters of this bill. They have sought to claim a unique mandate, that somehow the individual is paramount over the whole of society. I have no problem with the question of autonomy, but it must not subjugate broad community interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This line of argument at times trespasses into the region of emotional blackmail. The David Margan article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> is in that category. The implication in the article is that those who oppose euthanasia lack compassion and love. With respect, this is not only offensive but simplistic and puerile. It does not provide argument. It is rhetoric without substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have acted for people charged with horrendous crimes involving children. Some have been convicted, some have not. At no stage were my professional skills and judgment compromised by my christian beliefs. However, Margan suggests that I and my colleague from Menzies (Mr Andrews), also a lawyer, cannot bring to bear our professional skills and judgment to this issue uninfluenced by our personal beliefs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory's legislation is an imposition upon the whole of society. The Andrews bill removes that imposition. It is an attempt to remove a law that amounts to a blot on the fragile parchment of life and intrudes on the extant duty of care the state owes to its citizens to preserve life. The Northern Territory's legislation infringes the rights of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are reasonable alternative means available, other than killing people, to assist people in the last stages of life. Since such care is available, why are we having this debate? Do we want to devalue the standards of excellence of the medical profession by turning them into tradesmen of death? Do we want the state to sanction and encourage them to abandon their efforts to improve palliative care in favour of their making a living out of killing? Are hospitals to institutionalise death? Do we say, `Madam, the ward on the left is the killing ward. Sir, the one on the right is the caring one'? We cannot sanction state authorised killing because there is a suggestion that that is already happening. That is a particularly perplexing view of the situation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7355">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the limited time available to me let me say that if one person is killed, euthanased, who did not voluntarily agree to being killed then I am afraid that that is one person too many. I have not been persuaded by those on the other side of this debate who bear the onus `beyond reasonable doubt' that that cannot happen. The consequences of this legislation are far reaching. Abroad in the community will be a notion that life is not intrinsically unique.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people talk about opinion polls, I say that is irrelevant. I will give one example from a public meeting held in my electorate. A young woman who was suffering very badly from a serious illness spoke passionately about her right to die. Somebody then raised the question of the Sunday sport argument. She then changed her mind. She wrote to me recently saying that it was the Sunday sport argument that did it. You will remember that Sunday sport was regarded with horror 40 years ago. Look at it today, we all accept it. I was very impressed by that particular submission from that lady who changed her mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is informed opinion that we need to decide this debate, and the informed opinion suggests that this bill must be supported. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am opposed to this bill and I am puzzled at times after listening to some of the discussion and some of the rhetoric that has gone on in relation to it. There are so many people out there whose lives become an agony. I firmly believe that when people have reached a stage in life where they want an exit from that life, and if there are stringent safeguards there for them to initiate a process that will satisfy that need that they have expressed, then they should have the freedom to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate has understandably raised an emotional dimension that tends to divert our attention from the central issue of this whole discussion and that central issue is about personal freedom. It is not a freedom for others to do with your life what they want to do, the central issue is about the personal freedom for a person, with the proper safeguards that have been set out, to make a decision about their own life. That element has to be emphasised because it is really about individual rights and an empowerment of the individual. As Professor Baume and other eminent medical practitioners repeatedly state, euthanasia is commonly practised, but the role of the patient in the decision making process has to be understood and respected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what I stand here in defence of the role of the individual in expressing their wish, their desire, about their own future, about their own agony. I do not feel that I, as an individual or as a member of this parliament, have a right to condemn somebody to continued agony. If that is their wish, and if we can put in proper safeguards for them to arrive at the decision, then they should have that freedom to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is so extraordinary about this debate is what is not being said. That was partly what I was referring to in my opening words. So much is being said, but so much more is not being said. Euthanasia is practised frequently by the medical profession, sometimes with the knowledge of the person concerned, sometimes with the knowledge of family and friends, sometimes not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And let us not forget how many individuals there are out there who come to that stage of life and have nobody to share the knowledge with and nobody to consult. What do you think happens then? We know what happens. We are realists in the parliament. We move at all levels of society. So let us not fool ourselves by pretending that that practice is not happening. But who has the power in respect of that practice now? That power is with the medical profession alone.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7356">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look through the debate that has been taking place at the views coming from some sectors of the medical profession and the views coming from other sectors of the medical profession. All of us, and all of them, know that there is a frequent practice of euthanasia by the medical profession. The emotional appeals that come from institutional, and maybe political forums, from doctors themselves, from the spiritual areas&mdash;from the clergy&mdash;have to be seen in the context of restoring power to the individual. No matter how well&hyphen;intentioned some of these views are, I come back to the central issue: the right of an individual to have control of his or her own future and life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in privileged positions have always had access to an easy exit in the circumstances that have been talked about in this debate. They have always had it and they still have it. People in poorer circumstances do not. I think that distinction ought to be drawn very clearly. People without family or friends do not even rate in this debate and this discussion because the processes I have outlined earlier are already followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is about choice of individuals, and I firmly believe that people should have that choice. I firmly believe that the processes are there, or can be put in place&mdash;I will come to the Northern Territory in a moment. Those processes are there to protect and to ensure that it is not action initiated by third parties, as I have heard so much about in this discussion. That is not what it is about at all. And when I mentioned emotional debate earlier, I was being kind and I am putting it down to that. It is emotion and there is confusion about it. But our discussion, and the Northern Territory legislation is about individuals' own initiated activity in respect of themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not go further into some of the other arguments and discussions that have come forward because they fall over at that point. If you read through the table that best describes the Northern Territory legislation, you say, `What is this discussion that is going on?' So much of it is so far away from the process that is set out in the law and the process that is followed that I wonder why people are involved in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this is a debate about empowering the individual so that individuals regain control over their own lives. You read from the diagram in respect of the Northern Territory legislation that, firstly, the patient makes a request. It is the first test. `Does a medical practitioner wish to give assistance? Yes. Has patient attained age of 18 years?' You have to pass that. `Is the patient suffering from an illness that in its normal course without application of extraordinary measures will result in death?' The answer is yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next question is: `Is there any medical measure acceptable to patients to effect a cure?' If the answer is no, the next step is: `Is the only medical treatment reasonably available confined to the relief of pain, suffering and stress?' If the answer is yes, the next question is: `Has an independent medical practitioner with special qualifications in the patient's terminal illness confirmed the existence of the illness and the prognosis?' If the answer is yes, the next step is: `Has a qualified psychiatrist confirmed that the patient is not suffering from treatable clinical depression?' If the answer to that is yes, then the next question is: `Is the illness causing severe pain and suffering?' If yes, then `Has the medical practitioner informed the patient of all medical treatment available including palliative care?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the answer again is yes, the next question is: `Has the information on the availability of palliative care been provided to the patient by a medical practitioner with prescribed qualifications in the field of palliative care?' And then, if the answer to that is yes, `Are there palliative care options available to alleviate the patient's pain and suffering to levels acceptable <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7357"> to the patient?' All the way through this it is the patient, the person, who is being addressed here&mdash;not some other ideology elsewhere, and not some other point of view, but the person who is suffering. If the answer to that last question is no, then comes the question: `Has the patient formally indicated that he or she wishes to end life?' If yes, then `Has the patient considered the implications for his or her family?' If yes, then `Is the patient of sound mind and is the decision made freely and voluntarily?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And if the answer to that is yes, then more questions follow: `Have seven days elapsed? Has the patient completed a certificate of request? Has a medical practitioner witnessed the patient's signature and completed the declaration? Has the certificate of request been signed by an independent medical practitioner satisfied as to the patient's soundness of mind and the decision being a free choice? If the patient does not share the same first language as all the medical practitioners involved, has the certificate been signed by an interpreter? Will any medical practitioner involved or close associate gain any financial or other advantage&mdash;other than reasonable medical fees&mdash;from the death of the patient? Have 48 hours elapsed since the certificate of request was signed? Has the patient given any indication that he or she no longer wishes to end life?' Lastly, when the request has passed all of those hurdles, assistance to voluntarily terminate life may be given. It is voluntary; it is the individual who initiates it; it is the person himself or herself who makes the decision and initiates the activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my opening remarks, this debate is more important for what is not being said, and it is a debate and a discussion about giving back to individuals the right to make decisions about their own lives. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak on this occasion very briefly, simply to put my position on the record with regard to the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. A great many honourable members have spoken eloquently, passionately, sincerely and at some length on the issues in this debate, and I have certainly no wish to restate arguments or re&hyphen;present material that has already been amply put on the record. I simply want to make clear the arguments that have weighed with me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I oppose the Andrews bill and I support the continuation in operation of the Northern Territory legislation for four main reasons. Firstly, there is my strong belief that individuals should be free to make their own decisions about matters which are of fundamental importance to them and which cannot or do not impact in any relevant way on the rights of others. There can be no more fundamental decision than the decision to live or die. I simply do not believe that it is the business of the state to do any more than put safeguards in place to ensure that that decision is absolutely voluntary and has some objective justification in terms of the medical condition of the person in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there is my belief that the Northern Territory legislation does in fact contain all the necessary safeguards to ensure that the decision to die is made both absolutely voluntarily and in circumstances where the objective medical justification for that voluntary decision&mdash;a terminal illness, and all the suffering and indignity that goes with it&mdash;is absolutely clear. The member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) has again put on the record the key elements in the legislation, which I think do make it clear that it contains those necessary safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there is my belief that on all the available evidence, which, admittedly, for obvious reasons, is largely unofficial, anecdotal and unsystematic, voluntary euthanasia is already an omnipresent reality in our society, with doctors constantly being put in the position of being asked to take steps to hasten the inevitable and to help people escape an existence that has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7358"> become simply intolerable, but without having any legal basis to do so and being put in a very difficult position, very often, as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that this is happening and that there is a very large measure of community support, of tolerance, and of understanding, for its happening. My view is that in these circumstances it is usually much better for the law to adjust to reality rather than to be conspicuously at odds with it. Respect for the law is, as a general matter, simply not enhanced when it is seen as being out of touch with contemporary reality, with prevailing perceptions of relevant moral principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we are very aware that opinions differ, and differ strongly, on what the relevant moral principles are in the circumstances of voluntary euthanasia. But this is at least one instance where the opinion polls are a good guide at least to what the overwhelming view of contemporary Australians is as to the relevant moral principles that should be regarded as prevailing or determining one's judgment about the rightness or wrongness of the acts in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, there is my belief that all the great advances in modern medical science and palliative care, which have clearly done so much to relieve the awful physical pain suffered so often by so many terminally ill patients in the past, simply do not outweigh what one might describe as the psychic pain that is caused for so many people by being reduced to a state of helpless dependence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe anyone could fail to have been very deeply moved by the statement made by Bob Dent, the first person to take advantage of the Northern Territory legislation, about his plight in this respect. That awful erosion, which he stated so movingly, of his capacity for independence, his sense of dignity, and his sense of personal worth. I really do find that statement a complete answer to those who speak, in all good conscience, of the capacity these days for people to die peacefully. There may be, indeed, a degree of physical peace possible; but if dying is not psychologically peaceful for the person in question, it is not peaceful at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make clear that the states' rights argument is no part of my position on this debate. I do not challenge the capacity of the Commonwealth parliament to act in this matter. Indeed, I have always argued for the widest possible interpretation of the Commonwealth parliament's legislative powers, particularly on issues which are of genuinely national, rather than merely local, importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I will vote against this bill is not because I think it was inappropriately introduced in the federal parliament or even inappropriately debated in this main committee, but simply that it is wrong, in my judgment, in what it seeks to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) collects data on industrial disputation in Australia, consistent with international conventions. The data are published on a monthly basis and are regularly reported in the press.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with these conventions, the ABS measures time lost due to industrial disputation in those disputes in which ten or more working days are lost.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statistics of industrial disputes are compiled mainly from data obtained from employers (both private and public sector), from trade unions and from reports of government authorities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) It is undoubtedly the case that some industrial disputes can adversely affect a wide cross section of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Government does not intend to require unions to publish particulars of strike action in the mass media. However, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 contains provisions relating to the notification of `protected' industrial action, and provisions to minimise the disruptive effects of industrial action on essential services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for a limited right to engage in industrial action or to lock out employees in the negotiation of single&hyphen;business certified agreements. For industrial action or a lockout to be regarded as protected action (that is, free from certain civil liability) it must take place during a bargaining period, which is initiated by a party given written notice to each other party and to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) about their intention to reach an agreement. Industrial action <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7364"> or a lock out must also meet other conditions to be protected, including that it has been preceded by a genuine attempt to reach agreement, and notice must be given to the relevant party about the proposed industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where such industrial action is threatening to endanger the life, personal safety or health, or welfare of the population or a part of it, or to cause significant damage to the Australian economy or an important part of it, the AIRC can terminate the bargaining period. The AIRC is then required to conciliate and, if conciliation is unsuccessful and the AIRC considers it appropriate, to arbitrate. Any industrial action or lockout that persists following the termination of a bargaining period is not protected action, and would be liable to the range of remedies and sanctions available for illegitimate industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a limited right to engage in industrial action or to lock out employees in the negotiation of Australian workplace agreements.
