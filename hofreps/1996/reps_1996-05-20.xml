<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Public Service (Parliamentary Departments) Amendment Bill 1996 proposes to abolish the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, the Department of the Parliamentary Library, the Joint House Department and the parliamentary service heads of those departments and to create a new department&mdash;the Department of Parliamentary Services&mdash;with one head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable members will recall, during the last parliament an all&hyphen;party advisory committee was commissioned to inquire into and report on the creation of one department to replace the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the Department of the Parliamentary Library. On 24 November 1993, I, as Speaker, presented a bill to give effect to this measure, which was agreed to by this House but which, for a number of reasons, was bogged down in the Senate. Since the change of government, there has been a frenzied atmosphere of cost&hyphen;cutting in public expenditure. I invite honourable members to take one step further than the 1993 bill and endorse the combination of all departments serving the parliament, except for the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate, which are most desirably separate on a constitutional basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amalgamation would represent a recognition of the attitude previously adopted by the Presiding Officers and the then Minister for Finance that the Senate department, the House of Representatives department and the three service departments were separate entities for budgetary purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a period of increasing emphasis on micro&hyphen;economic reform, when the Public Service is being called upon to increase efficiency, it is impossible to justify the pinnacle of the democratic system, the legislature, being served by a system the origins of which are in the beginning of this century and which has not kept pace with the demands of modern times. This bill will send a streamlined structure into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits from corporate services alone, including the financial benefits, will be approximately $1&half; million a year at 1996 prices. The benefits will not only be in financial services and in financial savings. Not only will services to  senators and members not be diminished but there is every indication that they will in fact improve. There will be improvement in the delivery of information services with the Parliamentary Library, Hansard, the Parliamentary Information Systems Office, the Sound and Vision Office, the guide service, et cetera, all operating as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> separate client service programs and all supported by a single administrative and corporate management structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Physical and information support will be delivered under the one structure. It is envisaged that the Library Committee and the Joint House Committee of the parliament will continue, as will the Presiding Officers' advisory groups, so that members and senators will continue to have an input.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I call on both you and the President not to proceed with filling the position of the Parliamentary Librarian, which is currently vacant. This is a perfect opportunity to save immediately one position. If this bill is turned into an act, then obviously this will occasion the first of many savings. I call upon both government and opposition members to support this initiative and to give it speedy passage through not only this House but also the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Mr Speaker, I know that you in your new role understand that, as you embrace the responsibilities which you have&mdash;virtually as a minister&mdash;for a number of parliamentary departments, you will be subjected to pressures from government in looking at ways in which savings can be introduced across the whole range of the parliamentary structures that we have here. I think one of the easiest ways for you to tackle this problem would be to throw your wholehearted support behind this bill. In my view, it in no way will diminish the service which we as members and senators will receive. In fact, it will enhance that service. The argument that was run by Liberal&hyphen;National Party senators at the behest of others on the Senate side of this building in 1993 when this particular bill was proposed can be dismissed as nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has stood in this parliament and called for micro-economic reform, called for efficiencies to be gained, called for enhanced business practices and called for improvements in bottom lines, this is one way in which this can occur. I commend the bill to the House, and I seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> encourages more female Australians to enter the service of their country by active participation within the political process.</PARA>
<PARA>Edith Cowan OBE died in 1932. At the time of her death, after 71 years, she could possibly have been considered the most significant woman in our nation's history, and certainly her impact in Western Australia was profound. Recently the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  published the top 100 most influential women in the world. I believe some half a dozen Australian women were listed. If Edith Cowan were alive today, she would no doubt be listed in the top 20 internationally and ranked well ahead of any of the Australian women listed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Cowan was the great defender of social equity. Contrary to some of the recent social equity debate leaders, she not only spoke about it but also acted upon it. I believe she would have rejected many of the modern activists because rhetoric does not meet their reality. Edith Cowan was a woman of action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She is best remembered as the first woman to enter any Australian parliament. This year marks the 75th anniversary of her electoral success. How pleasing then that the 75th anniversary of her entry into parliament should also celebrate the biggest entry of women into the Australian federal parliament. Mrs Cowan <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would have been very pleased. She quoted Scriptures in her maiden speech when referring to the need for more women in parliament. She said, `It is not good for man to be alone.' She also said, `Men need a reminder, that a woman beside them could achieve great things for humanity and the home.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She nominated the poorly constructed State Children's Court Act and the expenditure of government funds in the development of government buildings as prime examples of her motivation to join parliament. At 60 years of age Edith Cowan was not young when she joined parliament, yet her extensive reputation for community service already preceded her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She was born in 1861 near Geraldton. Her mother died in childbirth. Her father was later hanged for the murder of her stepmother. Although these tragedies affected her to the extent of her becoming quite a loner, she most certainly made up for it with her service to the community. She was committed to social reforms which enhanced women's dignity and responsibility. She was also committed to reform for the care of mothers and children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She married James Cowan in 1879 and had four children. Although her social position became secure by her husband's appointment as Registrar and Master of the Supreme Court, she was able to appreciate the wider society's problems and work towards resolving many of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Cowan dedicated herself to voluntary work. She was the inaugural Secretary and later President of the Karrakatta Club. She was a state education advocate and served on the North Fremantle Education Board, one of the few public offices open to women at that time. She worked for the Ministering Children's League and the House of Mercy for Unmarried Mothers. She was a foundation member of the Children's Protection Society. She pioneered day nursing for working mothers in 1909.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She was the first woman appointed to the bench of the Children's Court. She was a justice of the peace and constantly urged the appointment of more women to these positions. She was the initiator of the Women's Service Guild. Through this membership as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="801"> the guild's vice-president, she was part of the lobbying and fundraising processes, which realised the opening of the King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women in Perth in 1916. She was secretary of the hospital's advisory board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She was prominent in the creation of the Western Australian National Council of Women and was president until she entered parliament and vice-president until her death. She was a foundation member of co&hyphen;freemasonry. She was the first female member of the Anglican Social Questions Committee and a coopted member of the Synod from 1923. She was an Australian delegate to the Seventh International Conference of Women. She was the co-founder of the Western Australian Historical Society and was active in the planning of the centennial celebrations in 1929. In 1920 she was appointed OBE for her social work and her work during the war years. Mr Speaker, I am sure you would agree that Edith Cowan was one great Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until her death she led a group of forceful, articulate women who made the Western Australian women's movement a model for others to follow. While she shared the movement's concern for purity, temperance and ameliorative social work, she also provided rational analysis of issues and an austere dedication&mdash;not quotas, but dedication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Edith Cowan spoke many times in parliament on many issues. She championed migrant welfare, infant health centres, women's rights and sex education in state schools. She was convinced of the necessity of a motherhood endowment and defended the idea of a housewives union. She introduced a private member's bill&mdash;the Women's Legal Status Act&mdash;in 1923 which opened the legal profession to women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Edith Cowan was in parliament for only three years. She was of the opinion that she belonged to a non-party organisation, being the Nationalist Party. She voted on issues rather than along party lines. She said in her maiden speech that she would be responsible only to her constituents. She also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are too many here today who are possessed of the old party spirit, which seems ever to exist, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but I cannot see why we should drag party into things that concern the whole of the state.</PARA>
<PARA>She was a very wise woman. Edith Cowan was a remarkable woman. A view of her first speech shows that she canvassed many issues. On the deficit, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all regret the country is obliged to debt . . . We certainly have a large one and it will be a bad day for us if it should suddenly be called up from Europe or elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder what she thinks of today's debt. On industrial relations, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many a strike would be prevented if the women had the right to vote . . . It is unfair that a strike could be called simply at the word of mainly single men, when they would be far better off without a strike.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is a unique concept worthy of further discussion nowadays, considering family impacts, et cetera. On migration, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is necessary that we select the right type of immigrant . . . The very best type of immigrant are our children.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, as you can see, Mrs Cowan was a woman with a social justice message, if her first speech is anything to go by. Edith Cowan did not need the help of her party. Edith Cowan did not need the help of her position. Edith Cowan did not need a quota. Edith Cowan achieved what she achieved on merit. She ended her maiden speech, and let me also end my speech, by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If men and women can work for the state side by side and represent all sections of the community and if the male members of the House would be satisfied to allow women to help them and would accept their suggestions when they are offered, I cannot doubt that we should do very much better work in the community than was ever done before.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want members to recollect when speaking and thinking of these things that we should all be wiser if we realised the truth of Kipling's lines: there are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal laws. And every single one of them is right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not always remember this principle. People are apt to think that the point of view of men only must be right for men, whilst women think that the point of view of women only must be right for women. That of course does not necessarily follow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we should aim at is to get via the media, so that we may work side by side, the women working along with the men and thus there will come to us "self knowledge, self reverence and self control, for these three alone lead men to sovereign heights" <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="802"> and to the achievement of those aims which should be sought by all parliaments . . . the peace and happiness of those for when they legislate.</PARA>
<PARA>Edith Cowan was a great Australian. She has been recognised this year, the 75th anniversary of her election to parliament, with the inclusion of her picture on top of the $50 note. I am both proud and very humbled to stand in this place representing a seat in her name on the 75th anniversary of her election to parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure to commend Edith Cowan. She is a great Western Australian. She has been one of our forebears in ensuring that women are in this parliament, as in many others. It was in 1920 that legislation was first passed in Western Australia to allow women to stand for our parliament. Edith Cowan was elected soon after that, in 1921, as the member for West Perth. I disagree with some of the observations made by the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) about her standing aside from the party system. Although she did that in the parliament, she paid a price: she lost her seat as a result of the combined efforts of the two major parties. So I think she learned, to her sorrow, that status had a cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Edith Cowan was born near Geraldton&mdash;indeed, my home territory. She was the daughter of a pastoralist, and her mother was a energetic educator&mdash;something that influenced Edith Cowan for all her life. Sadly, her mother died when she was but seven and, as we have heard, her father was hanged for the murder of his second wife&mdash;something that must have been a very sad outcome for Edith Cowan. She had to overcome some adverse publicity. The fact that she did is considerable testament to her courage and determination&mdash;something I think all women would say is necessary in public life even today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Edith Cowan spent a lifetime dedicated to improving the situation of women, children and families generally. She was interested in those less fortunate than herself. She was apparently a very powerful and persuasive public speaker. She had a very significant <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public life well before she entered parliament. She was a member of many committees and organisations and, indeed, the founder of a great number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the community, one of her major aims was for wider participation of women in public life and in policy formation. She promoted and fought for the vote for women, which was achieved in 1899. She was something of a beneficiary of that in 1921, as we have heard, but she fought for it anyway. She thought it was important for women not to be behind the throne but on it whenever that was possible to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have heard, she also made a very significant contribution to education and was particularly keen on ensuring that government schools were properly funded. She was also interested in tertiary education and an advocate for women achieving that level of education. Indeed, she worked tirelessly to raise funds for scholarships for Western Australian students, who at that time needed to go out of the state to get an education. In the end she got government support for her proposals, her various scholarship fundraising enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Edith Cowan was also a member of the District Education Board of North Fremantle. Again, I am pleased to underline that because that is where I live and part of the constituency I represent. She was one of the first women delegates at the first conference of the Boards of Education in 1911.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of all these characteristics is that Cowan regarded education as a necessity, especially for women. It was not simply a nice gloss to be put on for a polite society. She thought it was absolutely essential that, if women were ever to be taken seriously, they had to be well educated. It was one of the reasons we named the university `Edith Cowan University' when I was in government. Edith Cowan University is the result of the amalgamation of various teachers colleges, or CAEs as they became.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was some resistance when the Labor government which I led put forward that proposal. Some said it was not appropriate to name a university after a woman who had not taken advantage, or not been able to take advantage, of tertiary education. In fact, quite <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="803"> the reverse is true: she was very worthy indeed, given the efforts that she made. I am delighted that it still remains the pre-eminent university with a woman's name&mdash;the only one, as I understand it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for us to recognise today that Edith Cowan fought battles that still need to be fought. While we might congratulate the Liberal members opposite and the National Party for an increase in the number of women on their side of parliament, and I do, I also advise against complacency. We need only to look at the reduced numbers on our side to see why. I remind members of the House, particularly the women, that from 1980 to 1995 women on our side consistently outnumbered the conservatives, in the House of Representatives at least. We also went to the polls in 1996 with a comparable number of women candidates. A major swing produced a move: we lost women; you gained them. The net improvement is not very great. So whenever we see those nationwide swings we will see women going in and out with the tide, unless they are cemented into safe seats and they are not all sitting in marginals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Liberal members opposite would know&mdash;I am sure they have looked at their own figures&mdash;that a good number of their female members, seven of them, would disappear with a swing of less than three per cent. Most of them would go with a swing of less than five per cent. I do not particularly want to see that, although I certainly want us to return to government. I would rather see more women remain every time there is a change of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise&mdash;and we certainly want to make sure it is&mdash;that Labor women and the Democrats have generally led the debate on greater numbers of women in public life. I hope the members opposite, in particular the new women members, will contribute to that debate and help to set the agenda. I am sure that is what they want. They will know the problems of fighting in a marginal seat&mdash;not only of the risk of losing the seat but also of having to work extremely hard to maintain it. So, even if women around the country are in a parliament and in a marginal seat, they often have to put in extra <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effort. They have to put that much more time into their constituency. They cannot be away sitting on committees. They cannot be making sure that their point of view is in the policy of their parties to the same extent as if they were in safer seats. That puts them at greater risk when it comes to promotions and getting into cabinets, ministries and so on. So we are not there by any means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there has been criticism from those opposite of our quota system. We thought it was important not to promote women against merit but to recognise that, if merit principles operated, 50 per cent of us here would be women. We have to recognise that there is still a lot militating against the participation of women in public life today. We set a realistic time frame for our 35 per cent quota. It was not yesterday or tomorrow; it is the year 2002. We want to cement women into safe seats so that those problems I mentioned of being in marginal seats do not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quota has already been reached in some of our state parliaments, particularly in the lead-up to the next round of  elections. The problems we have are principally here in the House of Representatives and in a couple of states such as Queensland and New South Wales. I think it is also important to look not only at the representation of women in public life but also at what women might seek to achieve. I take the example of Edith Cowan. She was very clear that she was there in part, although not wholly, to improve the status and standing of all women. She was interested in industrial relations, and she was interested in education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="804"> Women need to strongly represent the interests of women. It can be done by proxy, as we have seen by the member for Cowan speaking on behalf of a great woman. But it is better if we do it directly, if we do it ourselves. I want to mention a couple of areas where I think women in this parliament should stand up and comment and, where appropriate, criticise. I hope women on the government side will do so also. I want to mention the negative impact of the industrial relations proposals on women. There is no doubt that a lot of the proposals that have been put forward by the new government will be detrimental to women. They will be detri mental to low wage, low skilled workers with poor union representation. And, unfortunately, that describes a great many women in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise that, because those contracts will be secret, it will be very difficult to know what is happening. We have these kinds of agreements in Western Australia. There is a lot of similarity between what is proposed at the federal level and what is going on in Western Australia, where women's wages have fallen behind in the last little while. The most recent figures from Western Australia show that Western Australian males earn above the national average. The seasonally adjusted average weekly ordinary time earnings for Western Australian males are $748.20 compared with the national average of $705. When you turn to women, the reverse is true. The national average weekly earnings for women are $586 whereas Western Australian women earn $570. That is a gap of nearly $200, and it is worse than the average for Australia as a whole. What that signifies to me is that those minimum standards which we have come to expect through the award system have already been eroded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very clearly opposed to the removal from the Industrial Relations Commission of the power to examine examples where there is not equal remuneration. The government's proposal will mean that only equal pay can be looked at and not overaward entitlements. We know that very often that is where the big gap occurs. They are just a couple of examples about which I hope the women in this House will speak out. I also hope they will speak out against cuts to education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It has been mooted that there will be substantial cuts to tertiary education in the amounts available and perhaps greater impositions of HECS on some students. The impact on women will be great. They are the ones who have benefited from an extension of the number of places and a reduction in costs. We change that at our peril. It is not good enough to have more women in this House if they are not able to prevent those sorts of changes, which are inimical to the long&hyphen;term interests of women. I certainly urge the women mem bers opposite to speak as women on these matters and not as members of their party.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) for taking the initiative in presenting this motion to the House today. It is entirely appropriate that we mark the 75th year of the first woman, Edith Cowan, entering an Australian parliament. Edith Cowan entered the Western Australian parliament some 27 years after South Australia became the first place in the world to simultaneously grant women the right to vote and to stand for parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1921, when Edith Cowan defeated a sitting member, she campaigned on her record for community service, law and order, and on the need for women in parliament to `nag a little on social issues'. During her time in parliament Edith Cowan promoted migrant welfare, sex education in state schools, infant health centres and women's rights. She also argued that a woman should be legally entitled to a share of her husband's income. It is also worth noting that Vida Goldstein was the first woman to attempt to enter federal parliament when she stood for the Senate in 1903. But it was not until 1943 that Enid Lyons was elected to this House and Dorothy Tangney took her seat in the other place. Vida Goldstein is on the record in 1911 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will find there is a great tendency to regard everything affecting women as a side issue.</PARA>
<PARA>Dame Enid Lyons commenced her maiden speech by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be strange indeed were I not to&hyphen;night deeply conscious of the fact, if not a little awed by the knowledge, that on my shoulders rests a great weight of responsibility, because this is the first occasion upon which a woman has addressed this House. For that reason it is an occasion which for every woman in the Commonwealth marks in some degree a turning point in history. I am well aware that, as I acquit myself in the work that I have undertaken for the next three years, so shall I either prejudice or enhance the prospects of those women who may wish to follow me in public service in the years to come.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the recent election, the Liberal Party had 11 women in the federal parliament&mdash;six in the other place and five members of the House of Representatives. Now the number of women has increased to 26&mdash;eight in the Senate and 17 in this place. In this chamber 23 per cent of my Liberal colleagues are women, and they all know that they came here on merit and not because of a quota. I take some satisfaction in South Australia's representation in this place. Of 12 seats, the Liberal Party holds 10, and of those 10 women hold four.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the member for Cowan, I congratulate the record number of women who came to this place after the recent federal election, noting that the ALP has four; the National Party brings its first woman to this chamber; there is one Independent; and that I have 16 Liberal colleagues. I wish them all well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we still need more women in this place. Labor's failure shows that its quota system does not work. Quotas were accepted as policy and then ignored and became just one more political stunt. The Australian public has become very cynical about political stunts. If the ALP had been truly committed to increasing women's representation in this place, it would have brought Mary Easson back via the former Prime Minister's electorate of Blaxland. But only two days ago a Labor man was preselected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal approach has been different. Guidelines have been written and the Liberal Women's Forum has been established with the specific purpose of encouraging and assisting women into parliament and giving them the opportunity to attend training seminars. The member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash), the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) and the member for Hughes (Ms Vale), along with Senator-elect Helen Coonan, are all graduates of the New South Wales Liberal Women's Forum.</PARA>

While giving the people in our electorates strong, sensitive and sensible representation, we will also have to ensure that Vida Goldstein's fears are no longer founded and that issues affecting women are not just seen as side issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and join him in acknowledging the unprecedented number of women members in the parliament. I would like to add my congratulations, along with those of the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), to every new woman member in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a woman and a mother of young children, I think I have some idea of the efforts that have been necessary by all the female members of parliament to actually achieve office&mdash;in a marginal seat as well. However, mere presence in larger than normal numbers in the chamber is not enough. This government has clearly demonstrated, already, that it has embarked upon a course of action whose outcomes will fundamentally erode the quality of the lives of women in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the terms of previous Labor governments, policies were implemented in many areas that made things better for women. Labor's subsidised child-care policies recognised that many women&mdash;now the vast majority of women&mdash;wish to continue with careers or as family breadwinners and enabled large numbers of women to rejoin the work force with considerable child&hyphen;care support. Labor's industrial relations policies have also made fundamental differences to women's lives. People in Australia now expect that women carrying out the same work as men would be paid an equal wage&mdash;something that I am sure would be supported, certainly on this side of the chamber. Most people would also expect that anyone in a workplace would get a fair go. This is an attitude that has grown largely as a result of the work of the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But now this government proposes to weaken the powers of the commission. Not only will this seriously threaten the conditions <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="806"> already won for women workers but also it will make it nearly impossible to reach a position of full equality because much more needs to be done. Women still earn only half the overaward wage payments of men. The tendency will be exacerbated where the discretion is left to the employer. Labor gave the commission power to address this issue of overaward payments. It also planned to look at the value of women's traditional skills through the equal remuneration provisions which drew on the ILO convention regarding equal pay. That too is about to go out the door.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the traditional areas of work for women has of course been in the role of carer. Labor's policies toward the elderly and disabled recognised that women traditionally have played and taken the role of carer and we provided considerable support for women in those roles. The number of people&mdash;mostly women&mdash;employed in these important areas has grown enormously over the last 10 years. But now we find that most of these gains for women are at risk. What will be the effect on the working conditions of women in child-care centres and homes for the aged if the role of the commission in dispute settling is removed? I think that is something that those opposite should think about. They will have nowhere to go. Women will be caught and exploited by their desire to provide care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will be the effect on family life of this government's proposed changes to the nature of part-time work? Working hours will be changeable at the whim of the employer and thus quite unpredictable. When hours are lengthened&mdash;and don't think it's a joke: this is what will happen, particularly in the retail sector and the finance sector&mdash;difficulties will face each and every woman who has children. They will find difficulties finding care for their children. When their hours are reduced they will generally still be liable for the costs associated with longer periods of child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes for the worse will come not only as a result of the weakening of the Industrial Relations Commission but also because this government has flagged its intention to abdicate its responsibilities in many other areas that affect women's lives. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Care for the aged and other service provisions are to be handed back to the dubious attentions of the states, as is responsibility for regulation and supervision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not good enough just to say that we should have more women in this place. It is terribly important that we as women know that it is women who will be left with the pieces as we see the disintegration of the industrial relations system, as these important areas of care are handed back to the states: it will be women as mothers, sisters, daughters, relatives and unpaid community workers that take up these very difficult roles in our community. I do not think that is good enough. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion acknowledging the 75th anniversary of Edith Cowan entering the Western Australia parliament. In my own electorate of Gilmore, so named after Dame Mary Gilmore, there is much to remind us of this woman. Whilst not a politician, she was a major influence on women of her day. She experienced much of Australia and was a champion of many causes, in particular the struggle of women. She was the first woman to have a regular weekly column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tribune</EMPHASIS> , something she used without fear or favour to further her cause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This recognition of Edith Cowan gives me the opportunity to emphasise the importance of support systems for women entering the political arena. Going back in New South Wales history, it was in 1888 that the Dawn Club was founded. This was a club in which women could share, debate and use their expertise in social reforms. In 1891 the Womens Progress Association was established, a forum to encourage public debate. In 1887 Louise Lawson launched the first journal for women, written by women and highlighting the right to vote. She also formed the Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales. In 1902 the Womens Political Education League was started by Ruth Scott.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="807"> When my own thoughts turned to politics there were no set criteria for entry. It was obvious that one had to have commonsense and the ability to recognise the possible from the impossible. Women are natural peacemak ers and we have the life experiences to equip us very well for life in the political arena. We are conscious of budget restraints and have sensitivity and the ability to make decisions. However, there are basic fundamentals that need to be addressed. We must have adequate training to improve our natural skills. This opportunity certainly exists in New South Wales under the guidance of the Liberal Womens Forum run by the federal women's president, Chris McDiven. This forum provides speech, media, debating and interview training and training on policy issues. It prepares possible candidates for preselection and personal appearances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the former New South Wales Premier, John Fahey, and Minister for Women, Kerry Chikarovski, another source for women was set up&mdash;the Women's Advisory Council. This was a bipartisan committee that discussed issues relating to women at home and in the workplace. We produced a magazine called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hersay</EMPHASIS>. Unfortunately, this has been discontinued under the Carr government. Women in the local government associations are also well versed in matters of policy debate, and training is given for women entering local politics. There are now a number of mayors in this association and all are committed to encouraging more women to stand for their local councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In digressing, I congratulate the Mayor of Kiama, Mrs Joyce Wheatley, on the announcement of her council's winning the national award for the tidiest town in Australia. Well done, Joyce and fellow councillors. Kiama, of course, is in the Gilmore electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mentoring in politics is still relatively new in New South Wales, although very successful in the business sector. I see this as being of the utmost importance for those of us here today and for future women. It is my belief that both sides of politics should require women to have access to party positions on their own merits. This would create a more equitable preselection process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been achieved by the Liberal Party. However, there is no room for complacency. It is the duty of women here today to encourage, train and nurture young people in all political movements. I admit that there is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a generation gap. We were born before credit cards and ballpoint pens; before pantyhose, dishwashers, clothes dryers and drip&hyphen;dry clothes; and before man walked on the moon. We got married first, then lived together. We were born before househusbands and dual careers. For us, sharing meant togetherness, not condominiums. A chip meant a piece of wood to heat the water. In our day, grass was mown, Coke was a cold drink and pot was something you washed in, rock music put you to sleep and aids were the helpers in school or a type of nurse. We were so dumb that we even thought you needed a husband to have a baby. No wonder we were so confused!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel very proud of Edith Cowan's achievements. I will finish with this quote about Australian women by E. Brown on 4 April 1894. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pen is mightier than the sword and is lighter to work with. This is the reason why we women are choosing it as our weapon with which to fight the great battle for equal rights.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very proud to rise to speak in this debate on Edith Cowan today. When I first read the motion I was going to move an amendment to clause 4 because I had thought that the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) had cheapened the memory of Edith Cowan by having a clause like that in a motion that should be commending and praising the 75th anniversary of the time she was elected to parliament. In fact, I remind him and other members in this House that in the time just two months short of her 71st birthday she had succeeded in doing what other women and men would like to have achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When talking about a party structure, you would have to acknowledge, as the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said in relation to child care, that in the three short years Edith Cowan was in the Western Australian parliament she forcefully amended the Administration Act, which placed equality for mothers with fathers when their children died intestate. I believe that she was also very proud to have the Women's Legal Status Act changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I want to particularly note, without duplicating what previous speakers have said about the wonderful life of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="808"> this marvellous woman, is that she is now depicted on our $50 note. I was very upset when Caroline Chisholm was taken off our $5 note. I hope we will have Edith Cowan there for many years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In talking about statistics and quotas, I would like to say to the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) that the reason Mary Easson is not standing for the seat of Blaxland following preselection is that she did not nominate. At least in the Labor Party we offer that alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) talked about training in local government. I spent eight years on the local government executive and was one of those people responsible for making sure that women did get trained to go into that form of government. I am glad to see it is continuing to be pursued in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have talked about statistics and the numbers that have come forward. My colleague the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) touched on that. Something like 25.42 per cent of our candidates at the last election were women, for the Liberal Party the figure was 34 per cent and for the National Party it was 6.45 per cent. In other words, the figure for the coalition government was 22.08 per cent of women candidates. If those opposite want to be a coalition in government, they have to acknowledge the statistics are for Liberal and National. Surprisingly, if we look at the Senate&mdash;which people seem to overlook&mdash;48 per cent of the Australian Labor Party candidates were women, for the Liberals it was 34.6 per cent and for the Nationals it was 42.8 per cent. The total for the coalition candidates was 36.36 per cent. The Democrats had a much higher rating in achieving their goals, even though they started with a small base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the fundamental things we have to remember is that, no matter what we as women in this House feel and no matter what we project and promote to make sure we get other women in, we can do that only if the women also choose to take that step. You will never forcibly get anyone to run for politics. I would like to say to the honourable member for Cowan, as he is acknowledging the 75th anniversary of the life of this wonderful <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> woman, that the first woman to take over the seat of Cowan, Carolyn Jakobsen, served in that capacity from 1984 to 1993. I wish the current member well in achieving the same number of years of service that she achieved as the first parliamentarian to take over the seat of Cowan following the redistribution of boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many differences arise between candidates, between politicians and between men and women. I say to parliamentarians in the House, of all sexes, that the many differences we do experience are within the sexes themselves rather than between them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a person that believes in the New South Wales structure of the rank and file preselection, I can assure you that, as someone who has had to do it on more than one occasion, I know the difficulties encountered in winning a preselection in a safe Labor seat. I also know of the difficulties and how hard it is when you are running for a marginal seat. But, believe me, it is just as hard to win preselection in a safe Labor seat, and to continually do that. I can also talk about that because in 1980&hyphen;81 I won the seat of Fairfield, one of the safest Labor seats in New South Wales at the time, and I took it to being the safest seat in the state with 81.9 per cent of the vote. At the time people were telling me that they may vote Labor but they would never vote female. We certainly put paid to that and closed that door in New South Wales. Certainly our men in the Labor Party would never use that saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the motion says, I join in congratulating all women who have been elected here. As the member for Fremantle commented, remember that it requires only 26 seats for the pendulum to move for us to come back into government again. Of those 31 seats, 10 are held by women and would require a swing of just 4.9 per cent. Going to the Mackerras pendulum, he says we require only 23 seats. Out of those 23 you would find that eight are held by women on the government benches. Eight of those seats would require a swing of less than 3.7 per cent and 10 would require a swing of less than 4.9 per cent. I wish them well in their endeavours.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in supporting this motion before the House today. Edith Cowan was indeed a remarkable woman who paved the way for women like me to enter politics. As the first Victorian Liberal woman to be elected to the House of Representatives and the first woman from any party to represent a rural electorate in Victoria, I have some understanding of the challenges which confronted Mrs Cowan when she was elected to the seat of West Perth in 1921.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If being a true feminist means to stand up for the rights of women, to highlight inequalities and lack of opportunity and recognition for women, and be prepared to take action, then I believe that Edith Cowan was not just the first woman to be a member of parliament but also the first feminist politician.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She was by any criteria we use to assess performances today a firm and resolute campaigner for recognition of women's rights, a contributor to the community and the nation and a fighter for equality. She was outspoken on the right of women to enter professions. In her maiden speech, she chided members that when the architects' bill was introduced she hoped that it would make it easier for women to become architects. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We shall never have satisfactory homes and Government buildings until women have been consulted.</PARA>
<PARA>At all times, Edith Cowan combined commonsense and her experience in community work with her political career. She had an innate ability to reduce complex issues to a practical level. For example, she highlighted the problem of poor returns for farmers in comparison with the end retail price by giving concrete examples of the price of mutton. However, Edith was not one simply to criticise. She invariably offered a solution or at least an idea for discussion. In this example she declared that there should be a woman on the price fixing commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my favourite examples of her down&hyphen;to&hyphen;earth grasp of a situation was when she raised in parliament the iniquitous issue of women with prams travelling on the railway having to pay an extra shilling simply because they were mothers taking their children in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prams.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Edith railed against this and claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Minister for Railways should be made to parade the streets of Perth for the whole of the afternoon with a heavy infant on one arm and a bag of groceries on the other.</PARA>
<PARA>She felt then that the minister's attention would be focused on the handicap many mothers had to bear simply because they could not afford that extra shilling for their prams. Apparently, the minister withdrew the extra charge immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the features of Edith's short parliamentary career that I admired was her tenacity in highlighting the differences in opportunities between the cities and the country. Unfortunately these problems still exist today and it is now up to those of us who represent regional communities to continue the work Edith started 75 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion before the House today is indeed fitting: in the 75th anniversary of Edith Cowan's election to parliament we now have the greatest number of female representatives&mdash;20.5 per cent of all MPs. But, as my colleagues have pointed out today, we still have a long way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to the maiden speeches of many of our new female MPs, I have noted that they too share a similar history to Edith Cowan&mdash;a strong base in community work, each having already established a reputation in their former career and each with a desire to contribute their skills to achieve a better country. I could imagine Edith Cowan enjoying the stimulation of so many female MPs. I believe that she would have felt well pleased that today there are increasing numbers of women in parliaments right across the country who, like Edith, are prepared to stand up for their convictions in open competition with both their male and female colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like so many true feminists today, she would have been appalled at the tokenism of a quota system to increase the percentage of women in parliament. She believed, as do those of us female parliamentarians here today, that women deserve and are entitled to the same opportunities as men, that our skills and expertise be recognised. But Edith, like those of us here, did not seek special favours <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="810"> because of her gender.

In 1959, in South Australia, Jessie Cooper was elected to the state parliament and was challenged by a man on the basis that only a person could sit in parliament and, of course, a woman was not a person. I might add that Premier Playford had the good sense to throw such a foolish argument out.

An article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  which mentions ALP powerbrokers includes a comment by Jennie George.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon to speak on the motion moved by the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), whose electorate bears the name of Edith Cowan. I am pleased to enter the debate because the tertiary institution, Edith Cowan University, which bears Edith Cowan's name has a campus within my electorate. That campus contains the very successful Western Australian Academy for the Performing Arts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason I am pleased to enter the debate is that Western Australia&mdash;and, in particular, the Western Australian Labor Party&mdash;has a very fine record of firsts on the representation of women and the representational rights of women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1935, May Holman became the first woman member in the then British Empire to hold a parliamentary seat for 10 years. In 1943, Dorothy Tangney became the first woman to be elected to the Senate. She went on to become the first woman to preside over the Senate. In 1983, Wendy Fatin, a recent former colleague, was the first Western Australian woman to be elected to the House of Representatives. She was also the first Western Australian woman to become a federal minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1987, Kay Hallahan, a member of the state parliament, became the first woman to be elected as deputy leader of a party in either house of the Western Australian parliament. In 1988, Judyth Watson became the first woman to serve as chair on a select committee of either house of the state parliament. In 1990 the now member for Fremantle, Carmen <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Lawrence, became the first woman Premier in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those very fine and distinguished women members of the Western Australian state parliament and the Australian parliament were preselected and became members of parliament representing the Australian Labor Party. Western Australia&mdash;in particular, the WA branch of the Australian Labor Party&mdash;has a fine record on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Edith Cowan represented the state seat of West Perth in the 1920s. That state seat had some territory which I now represent as the federal member for Perth. As the biography of Edith Cowan will show, she was a firm advocate of education. As a member of the state parliament, she used her term to promote migrant welfare, infant health centres and women's rights. One of her passionate commitments was education, which is reflected by the existence of Edith Cowan University today. I am sure that Edith Cowan would not be at all impressed with what is proposed in education by those on the other side&mdash;as is depicted in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 16 May entitled `Outrage over university cuts'&mdash;namely, to slash ongoing expenditure to universities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion is not just about a question of the sex of a particular member of parliament; it is also a question of the policies which those particular members of parliament advocate in the parliament and in the community generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure Edith Cowan would be none too impressed by the way in which those members opposite have done their best to ensure that life will be harder in Australia for newly arriving migrants, as they have done with their proposal to reduce eligibility for benefits from a six&hyphen;month waiting period to a two&hyphen;year waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="813"> The motion by the member for Cowan refers to the largest contingent of women parliamentarians in the current parliament and to the need&mdash;or the lack of need, in his view&mdash;for a quota system for preselection. The reason there is a large contingent of women members of parliament opposite is that they had a resounding electoral victory. We have many women members of parlia ment on that side of the House today because the Liberal and National parties have done what they have been doing for years: choosing women to run in seats which they did not think they could possibly win.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quota system seeks to remove the institutionalised obstacles and institutionalised discrimination which ensures that the number of women representatives in this parliament and in state parliaments is not as it ought to be. Representation ought to roughly reflect the demographic breakdown of the community. If it were the case that parliaments reflected the demographic proportion of women in the community, then we would find, without need to resort to quotas, effectively equal representation. That has not occurred historically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those women members opposite should remember one thing: after the next election there will be a sea change on your side and you will return to your usual numbers. My very strong advice to those women members opposite who are here for a once&hyphen;only occasion is that, so far as your previous career is concerned, take leave, do not resign, and so far as your accommodation in Canberra is concerned, rent, do not buy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the largest number of female parliamentarians ever to enter the federal parliament. This would not have been possible on quotas alone. As women have found out in the last decade, merely enacting a law for equal opportunity does not ensure that it occurs. There needs to be an underlying commitment by men to carry the rhetoric into action before real choices for women are realised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party has done this with the women's forum, which is supported by the males as well as the females. It is through this forum that the Liberal Party actively seeks women of talent, promotes and trains them, and provides them with opportunities to perform. From there on in, it is up to the women themselves to show that they are leaders of men&mdash;as well as of women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not call myself a feminist. I do not seek to go where no woman has gone before. I joined the military not to be the first female fighter pilot but to serve my country, as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> countless women have done before me&mdash;in administration, medicine, engineering and supply. I do not call myself a feminist. I do not want to right the wrongs of males in the past at the expense of males here today. I ran for parliament not for the sole purpose of furthering women's rights, but because I believed that I could bring true representation of the women and men of Lindsay to federal parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not call myself a feminist. I do not believe that there are no differences between men and women. I hope to have a family one day, and I will face the biological challenges that that entails. It may interrupt my working life; it may end it. It may impact on my superannuation; it will impact on my standard of living and my selfish use of time. I would like support and companionship in child raising. I do not seek a provider who spends 11 minutes a day with his children and even less with me. I am quite capable of providing for myself, thank you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women today make up 43 per cent of the paid work force; 52 per cent of married women are in paid work. They are not going back into the kitchen, and that is something our society has to deal with. Males' expectations, learned from a traditional mother of two decades ago, are not being found in the women of today&mdash;women who marry later, have children later, have a higher education and independence than of any other women in any other era. I believe that our divorce rate is up because males are not adapting to women who want more than a provider&mdash;women who want companionship, equal sharing of household chores, respect for their intellect and achievements and frailties, involvement in recreational pursuits and social and work life. It is a crucible of adjustment in male and female relationships in our society today. And recognition of the difficulties puts you in a position to legislate to repair the fabric in which our children are raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More and more women are going to be entering into active participation within the political process. They are not trailblazers or anti-man. They are genuinely concerned about the direction of this country and our children's future, as Edith Cowan was. It is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="814"> only because of women like her that women like me can be in parliament today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not call myself a feminist. The mere word places you in a pigeonhole from which it is difficult to escape. But I am pro women's choice. That can be achieved only by the cultural change occurring at the moment in the X generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank my campaign manager, Beverley Jackson, who is in her sixties and not very well off. She is still on a hospital waiting list, waiting to have an annoying knee injury repaired. She never patronised me as a female but gave me solid support and the odd bit of motherly advice. With women like her, Jenny Power and Anne Cohen, who actively support other women, the Liberal Party will increase its representation of women in parliament as a natural progression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks also go to Olivia Barnes, Penny Mallard and Rebecca Mason who always have new initiatives for women in the Liberal Party and who are ably supported by Chris McDiven of the women's forum. Thanks also go to Mary Davidson who, although retired, is an honorary member of the young libs anyway; Shirley Rae, who solidly supported my efforts; and Eileen Cammack, a past mayor of Penrith, who still commands a mighty presence at 80. Thanks also go to Pat Casson, Robin Wiles, Leonie Jackson, Pat Coulter, Della Janes, Angela Brady, Wendy Anderson, Robyn Anderson, Jackie Marshall, Helene Miesler, Glenys Simpson, Karen Chichoff, Marie Powpter, Robin Burton, Robyn Borland, Lorna Parr and Irene Shaw&mdash;and all other women who have ever supported other women.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a bit concerned that the work begun by the wonderful Edith Cowan of whom we have heard today, and others like her, is about to be undermined by the lack of commitment of the new coalition government, in particular in the funding of national women's organisations. I refer to paragraph 5 of the motion before us where we promote and entice <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> women to become part of the political process. This is of huge concern to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national agenda for women grants program ends on 30 June and, therefore, funding does too. There has been total silence by the coalition government on this essential grants program. All requests for information from the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Newman) have resulted in nothing other than a dismissive `wait until the budget in August'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The August budget will be too late for the 20 or so national women's organisations that are currently funded under the program&mdash;programs which I am certain Edith Cowan would endorse totally. Those programs include things like the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia, the Foundation for Australian Agricultural Women, the Catholic Women's League, the Older Women's Network, Women With Disabilities Australia and the National Council of Women Australia. I wonder how pleased Edith Cowan would be to see that, on the 75th anniversary of her election to the WA parliament, the real gains in women's rights and representation in parliament are yet to be achieved and are currently under threat by the policies of those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite this being the largest contingent of women parliamentarians ever to enter the Australian parliament&mdash;and that is something I am particularly proud of and pleased to see&mdash;there are still only 23 women out of the 148 members in this place. It is not good enough for political parties to grandstand about which party has more women MPs. As I have said before in this place, until women have equal representation in the parliament as a matter of course, the problem has not been attended to. The true meaning of full and proper representation of the community will not have been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any fair-minded observer of the recent federal election would recognise that only a very small swing&mdash;as has been said already today&mdash;would unseat many female members opposite. That, despite my political membership, is something I would not like to see happen. Women should be in here because they deserve to be here; the community <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="815"> deserves to have proper and equal representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the ACT and as member of the ACT community, I say this with pride: three of the five federal parliamentarians elected at the 1996 poll were women. This excellent result was achieved because both the ACT Labor and Liberal parties have a proud record of supporting women candidates. The ACT branch of the ALP enacted affirmative action as preselection rules in the early 1980s. Since then we have seen a number of talented female candidates preselected and go on to represent the party with distinction in public office&mdash;and, I might say, with consistency in public office. This policy has clearly been successful in encouraging more women to become actively involved in the political process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I do not hesitate at all in endorsing the sentiments of the final paragraph 5 of the motion of the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). I do, however, view with some cynicism paragraph 4. It is a pity that we have to have a grandstanding type motion on numbers in this House on a political basis&mdash;when, really, all women are welcome in this House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I advise the House that 75 students from one of the many excellent schools in the Greenway electorate are visiting parliament this week. The school is the Patrician Brothers College, Blacktown, which has 1,100 students and has operated in the Blacktown area for over 43 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The school has an excellent academic and sporting record. In the maths and science Australia wide competition, the school had a healthy number of high distinctions and credits. Students' art work was on display in the Commonwealth Bank during the year. The music department continues to thrive, with the students performing creditably at two concerts during the year. The industrial arts department has its usually high quality of work on display on open night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Debating and public speaking have been encouraged amongst the students to increase self&hyphen;confidence. The winning of the Apex debating competition by years 8 and 9 was a fitting reward for the hard work that goes into competitive debating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the sporting field, the college won the statewide Berg Shield cricket competition title and the prestigious Junior Commonwealth Bank Cup rugby league competition. The school captain, David Beacroft, won the Metropolitan Catholic Schools Association junior sports boy of the year award and was the state and Australian champion in both the 1,500 metres walk and run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The college developed an international spirit with some 16 Japanese students visiting the school for a two&hyphen;week period during 1995. This was the first group of overseas students to visit the school, so it was an experience for all concerned. The families that billeted the students, the Japanese visitors and the students from the school found the cultural exchange quite an eye&hyphen;opener.

Would the Prime Minister advise the House of progress being made by the states and territories to implement the necessary legislative changes agreed at the meeting of ministers; by what date does the Prime Minister intend that legislative changes will be in place and operational in the states and territories?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="819" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his comments. May I also place on record here, as I have elsewhere, the appreciation of the government for the completely bipartisan attitude and the constructive approach taken by the Leader of the Opposition and members of the Australian Labor Party, both federal and state, on this very difficult and important issue. I also take the opportunity of recording my thanks to state governments of both political persuasions for the attitude that they have taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition asked me what progress has been made. My understanding is that the ACT Legislative Assembly passed legislation last week. It is my understanding that legislation is being prepared in the other states. In the case of New South Wales, it was given effect to by regulation pending the preparation of legislation. In some of the other states, most notably Western Australia and South Australia, in relation to registration there are already laws and regulations which go very close to meeting, if they do not in fact meet, the aspirations of the police ministers meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as the other states are concerned, in relation to the other particulars I do not have the dates available to me. It is my understanding that they are moving as soon as possible. I undertake to the Leader of the Opposition that I will specifically find out whether there are dates and, if there are, I will make them available to him and make them public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity, as the Leader of the Opposition has asked me this question, of saying a couple of other things about the issue. It was an important decision and it was a decision that I believe was welcomed by the overwhelming majority of the Australian community, irrespective of their politics and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> irrespective of whether they live in the cities or the rural or provincial areas of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a lot of remarks made since the meeting and it is fair to record that this is a decision that will cause some inconvenience to many thousands of law abiding Australians. I have had occasion already to remark on the impact it might have on the rural community of Australia. Can I say again that I am sorry for that because the rural people of Australia normally put the national interest ahead of other considerations and I regret that many tens of thousands of law abiding primary producers will no longer have quite the same flexibility in relation to the possession of weapons that they have had in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision that was made at the police ministers conference made it plain that self&hyphen;loading weapons were to become prohibited weapons except for limited categories. One of those exceptions was the police, another was the armed forces, another was professional shooters and, where a clear need was demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local licensing authorities, also primary producers. There is no intention on the part of the Commonwealth government to encourage any expansion of those exemptions. We believe that those exemptions cover all appropriate cases and it is very important that they be adhered to. I will certainly be encouraging all my colleagues at a state level to ensure that that happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="820"> Some of the remarks that have been made on behalf of those who disagree with the decision of the governments of Australia have unfairly besmirched the reputation of people who are sporting shooters. I say to the sporting shooters associations of Australia: I understand that you are upset with the Commonwealth government's decision and the decisions of the state governments. I know that you are not personally responsible for any of the tragedies that have occurred in this country involving weapons over the past few years. I can feel for people who believe that something that they enjoy is being taken away from them and that a way of life that they have come to like is being taken from them. That is unfortunate and I&mdash;and I think every body in the House&mdash;sympathise with them. In no way do we associate some of the more irresponsible remarks made by particular individuals with the bulk of sporting shooters in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That having been said, there won't be any change in the government's approach on this issue. Our position is firm and irrevocable. In stating that, I know that I have the support of the opposition and, more importantly, with no disrespect to the opposition, the support of the bulk of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been a great trauma for Australia. It was an enormous tragedy that is going to leave its scar on this country for many years to come. We owe it to the people who died in that tragedy and to the people who continue to suffer the scars of that tragedy to grab something better and build something new out of it. What the governments of Australia decided to do last Friday week was to take a new turn in this country. We decided as a community, across party lines, to reject the American approach, to say that this country rejected resort to violence and physical abuse as a way of settling differences whether in the community, the home or anywhere else. The best way that we can symbolise the fact that we are a non&hyphen;violent society is to make absolutely certain that there is a determination in this chamber and in this parliament, across party lines, to give full faith, effect and credit to the decision that was taken last Friday week.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The other decision that has been announced <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by the federal government is to increase by 0.2 per cent on a one-off basis only the Medicare levy for the purposes of financing the buyback of the weapons.

So they are the two specific actions that have been taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I also take the opportunity of saying to the honourable member for Groom that when the legislation dealing with the increase in the Medicare levy is introduced it will include a provision to impose the 0.2 per cent component of the levy on members of the ADF who are currently exempt from the payment of the Medicare levy. We are taking that decision in the interest of equity. It is only fair and reasonable that the only people exempted from this particular increase are those taxpayers who, by virtue of the low level of their incomes, are not affected by the Medicare levy. That is why that particular anomaly was thrown up. I would not think anybody on either side of the House would have any particular objection to that.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we call on the ACTU and the union movement generally to soberly reflect upon the damage caused to the trade union movement over the last 13 years and ensure there is no repeat of a process which in effect puts the political survival of the ALP before industrial interests of workers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a lesson that members ought to take heed of. It is interesting that whilst the Leader of the Opposition is said to be cutting his close links with the ACTU&mdash;according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  and the shadow minister who does not know whether he is for it or against it&mdash;the shadow treasurer thought it was such a good idea that recently he said:</PARA>

<PARA>So there are some for it and some against it. The reality is that, because they cannot work out their relationship with the ACTU, they have no position on one of the major debates in this country today; that is, the question of industrial relations reform. It is true, as Jennie George said, that workers actually lost out as a result of the accord. She is not the first woman on Labor's side to say that.

The minister will be aware of the high rate of youth unemployment in my electorate of Forde and the southern suburbs of Brisbane. The minister will also be aware of the personal and economic hardship unemployment causes young Australians. Will the minister inform the House what action the government is taking to preserve youth jobs?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="828" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is very concerned about the high rates of youth unemployment. We are absolutely determined to do all that we can to ensure that, unlike in the previous 13 years, in the future young people have a chance of a job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The issue raised by the honourable member relates to some part of the ill&hyphen;fated Brereton reforms in 1993 which, by the initiative of the Australian Democrats in the Senate, introduced certain age discrimination, or anti&hyphen;age discrimination processes. They were due to come into effect. The previous government deferred their coming into effect until 22 June 1997, because I believe that they themselves were also concerned about the effect of those provisions on the youth labour market. Our proposals will defer indefinitely the discrimi natory anti&hyphen;discriminatory provisions of the existing Industrial Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government's idea was to find an alternative to junior wage rates based on competency. It is true the parties have been sitting down trying to find a reasonable solution; but it is also a fact that they really have failed to do so. It is true that the matter has been before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission but, on any fair reading of it, a third&hyphen;best solution has been arrived at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, in the competency provisions of this alternative, they rely very heavily on asking questions of applicants as to how many years they had at school and how many years it has been since they left school. In other words, they have a so&hyphen;called alternative competency based system, but it really is a de facto age based system anyway. The nonsense of this is that that proposal, if it were to come into effect on 22 June, would probably be subject to legal challenge anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had lots of discussions about this matter in our consultations. Looking at the labour market in Australia, for example, in the retail industry, 283,000 young people have got jobs. We have had discussions with the Retailers Council of Australia and, on their estimates, they say something of the order of 220,000 of those jobs could be at risk if Labor's scheme were allowed to continue.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do say to the other side that, if they are genuinely concerned about young people, then they ought to support this particular aspect of our proposal. I should add that exemptions for junior wage rates are provided in all the state and territory jurisdictions&mdash;in other words, supported by branches of the Labor Party around the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, there have been quite a lot of public comments about this in the last few days. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="829"> Retailers Council of Australia in a statement say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless the Minister's proposal is endorsed by Parliament almost a quarter of a million jobs of young Australians will be at risk and Australia's already high level of youth unemployment will skyrocket.</PARA>
<PARA>That has been followed up by an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a sensible move&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the government's proposal. It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a situation where young people are increasingly competing with older, more experienced employees for a limited pool of jobs, youth wages can provide a competitive advantage. For many, this might be the only means by which they can achieve an employment foot in the door.</PARA>
<PARA>The ACCI media release makes the same point. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The removal of junior wage rates from awards would see youth unemployment rates soar. The jobless rate among teenagers is already running at 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>And it goes on and on and on. This is a very simple decision to be made. It ought to be supported by the opposition parties.</PARA>

The government is aware of concerns being expressed by a number of contracted case managers and private training providers of labour market programs that funds are not currently being made available under these contracts. The government has not frozen labour market program expenditure. The government is engaged in an exercise of prudent management of this funding in view of the situation which it found on coming to office after the federal election this year. The government has been forced to act because of the fact that so large a proportion of the moneys allocated for this year, the $2.1 billion allocated in last year's budget, to help unemployed people had been spent in the run-up to the election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>

The reason for this? The previous minister had two options. When he saw this gross overexpenditure of money taking place he realised that this was going to leave all those responsible for the delivery of programs in a very difficult situation in the last third of the year. He had the option of slowing down the expenditure. Did he do that? No, no. The message went out: `Spend up, spend more up to the election campaign, try and hide the unemployed in the figures.' Or he had the option of bringing funding forward from next year. Mr Speaker, he did neither. In a gross dereliction of duty he allowed this mismanagement of this enormous budget to take place with the result that there is now considerable concern throughout the community at the flow of funds.

In the wake of the Port Arthur incident, and in the wake of the police ministers meeting on 10 May, it is undoubted that the overwhelming majority of Australians want Australia to be a safer place. In this context, it is a matter of some regret that there are available magazines of the type mentioned by the honourable member. He asked about controls in respect of them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the national classification code, which is created under that legislation, there is a restriction on the classification of material that promotes, incites or instructs in matters of crime or violence.

The Office of Film and Literature Classification, which is the Commonwealth body which does the classification, has no role in relation to the enforcement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are laws which provide for significant penalties. For example, in the ACT, distribution or sale of a publication of the type mentioned carries a penalty of 12 months gaol or a fine of $10,000.

Some of them were people who had landed here as boat people and returned in expectation that they would be brought back under a special assistance category. If you want to go through all the categories, I am more than happy to do so. But they were not necessarily asylum seekers in refugee camps accorded priority by the UNHCR.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it was in response to a request from the UNHCR to provide additional resettlement opportunities for people from the former Yugoslavia that the former government announced that it would borrow&mdash;and I use those words advisedly&mdash;2,000 places from the 1996-97 program, including 665 places for refugees. The fact is that the humanitarian program for 1995-96 is, in reality, or has been 13,000. Fifteen thousand was a highly artificial figure. The former government did not budget to pay for the extra 2,000 places this year. In fact, it intended to pay for the places from next year's program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no criticism of the decision of the former government to respond to an urgent need. But it was Labor that manipulated and fiddled the figures to achieve its objective.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It clearly was. The former government borrowed 2,000 places from next year's program for dealing with the situation of 1995-96. It did not, as it could have done, allocate additional places. The fact is, the starting point for consideration of the 1996-97 program is 13,000 less 2,000 places that Labor has already allocated. In other words, it is 11,000; it is not 13,000. It is certainly not 15,000. The starting point for refugees is certainly 3,335 places, not 4,000.</PARA></TALK.START>

No, he sat silent in relation to these matters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> congratulates Romano Prodi, Massimo D'Alema and all members of the Olive Tree coalition for their magnificent win in the Italian general elections;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> acknowledges the results as the most significant national success of the political Left in Italy since World War II;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognises that this historic change represents a rejection by the Italian electorate of the sterility of political conservatism and a pursuit of political stability.</PARA>
<PARA>I would hope that all members of the House would applaud the historic victory that was recorded on 22 April of the Italian left coalition known as the Olive Tree, under the leadership of Romano Prodi. Mr Prodi was named as the Prime Minister designate by the President last Thursday, and he held his first government meeting over the weekend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The victory of the Olive Tree coalition is probably the most promising development in the Italian political scene in the postwar period. Certainly it represents a deliberate break with the political failures, instability and corruption of the past. There is no doubt that, as my motion expresses, the election outcome represents a rejection by the Italian people of what has proven to be the sterility and the compounding failures of political conservatism. That was best exemplified by the discredited and rejected Right coalition under Silvio Berlusconi, which includes the neo&hyphen;fascist national alliance of Gianfranco Fini. Berlusconi is now facing corruption charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been the domination of the Italian government by right&hyphen;wing conservatives which has paralysed the Italian nation for half a century. There is now a chance for it to break out of this stultifying political straitjacket, but it must grasp the opportunity. The longer term interests of the Italian people would have been vastly better served had the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Right coalition collapsed and been rejected years ago. Its persistence was due largely to the survival instincts of its self&hyphen;seeking participants and to the financial support of powerful backers who recoiled from what they saw as the possibility of a Cuban&hyphen;type communist enclave in Western Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find quite disturbing the recent development in which the Olive Tree coalition has offered to discuss with the right-wing alliance that it take important posts in the new parliament. It will be a pity if the opportunity is lost to develop a two&hyphen;party or a two&hyphen;bloc system with a clearly defined government and opposition. For everyone to pursue a role in government has been self&hyphen;indulgent and destructive. It has been a formula for instability and political failure. Prodi, with minor centre and left party support, can have a working majority. He should use it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are at least two reservations about the future survival of the Prodi government. First, the victory was not complete. The Olive Tree is about 30 seats short of an absolute majority in the 630&hyphen;member Chamber of Deputies and only has a slight majority in the Senate. Second, in order to honour the clear intention of the Italian people, it is more important that the Olive Tree coalition govern with the support of the Marxist PRC, or the Communist Refoundation, rather than with the support of any of the neo&hyphen;fascist elements of the Right. Prodi has confirmed that he will accept the support of the PRC. I believe he should do so. The Prodi government will be the first Italian government in almost 50 years to include ministers from the left of the political spectrum. The defeat of the Right alliance was long overdue. It finally collapsed under the weight of the corruption scandals which engulfed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the motion indicates, it seeks to convey the best wishes of this House for the success of the Prodi government in pursuing social and constitutional reform. This is a magnificent opportunity for it to do so. In pursuing social and economic reform, it is to be hoped that it is not seduced into an economic rationalist approach, with an overdependence on discredited and failed market processes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="839">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Neither Mr Massimo D'Alema, who leads the coalition's biggest faction, the PDS, the Democratic Party of the Left, nor Mr Fausto Bertinotti, who leads the Marxist PRC, should allow the new government to repudiate or retreat from a commitment to real social reform and social justice. It must remain committed to the importance of the public sector and to a comprehensive system of support for those who are economically and socially the most vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Constitutional reform is essential. There is an urgent need to simplify Italy's complex electoral system. It has spawned an array of political parties and groupings which have compounded the problems of achieving political stability and continuity. The Prodi government, for example, will be the 55th Italian government since World War II: 55 governments in a period of 51 years. National political instability on such a scale is a recipe for disaster. The disaster has been expressed in the failure of the Italian nation to achieve its potential. It is a tragedy that the excesses and political self&hyphen;indulgence of the past are now likely to inhibit the capacity of the new government to embark on a more ambitious reform program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will require the not insignificant talents of Mr Prodi, his ministers, the bureaucracy and the monetary authorities to strike the right balance between the objectives of accelerating non&hyphen;inflationary growth, reducing Italy's massive public debt, reducing unemployment and constructing a proper social safety net. To achieve this, an honourable compact with the trade union movement is clearly an absolute essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite some of the more sensational headlines since the Italian elections, it cannot be said that the new Italian government will be dominated by the Left. All that is certain is that a loose coalition of moderates chose to align itself with the Left in order to avoid a repeat of the extreme Right arrangements of the past with their strong neo&hyphen;fascist influences. Such an outcome would have been a disaster of significant dimensions; however, the threat still exists. After all, the extreme Right was still able to capture about 40 per cent of the total Italian vote.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my major concerns is that this moderate but anti-fascist alliance represented by the Olive Tree coalition may gradually drift to the right. It would be extremely unfortunate if advantage was not taken of the Left contributing to the restructuring of the Italian nation. To allow a slide back to the past would represent a gross betrayal of the clear intentions of the Italian people to break with it. If this opportunity is lost, Italy may yet reap the whirlwind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The election results indicated that, within the 630-member Chamber of Deputies, the Freedom Alliance won almost 300 seats. The Freedom Alliance, of course, is the old discredited right&hyphen;wing conservative Alliance&mdash;and, to some extent, neo&hyphen;fascist alliance&mdash;because it contains within it the neo&hyphen;fascist national alliance. In the Senate, that same Freedom Alliance won about 116 out of the 315 seats. The Northern League, the federalist group which is seeking to establish a federal system, achieved 27 seats. Its longer term objective may well also be secession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the Olive Tree coalition was adopted as the name for that coalition of moderate to Left members of the Italian parliament was that the olive tree is often a symbol for peace. When an aged persons' hostel in my electorate was named after my good friend Mr A.J. Frame last weekend, I was reminded of that when Mr Frame's sister, Mrs Dawn O'Connor, sang the song <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Olive Tree</EMPHASIS>. The words and music of the song were written by both Tom Springfield and Diane Lampert. I would like to record these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tell me, white dove, where will I find the olive tree? For just one branch I'd search my whole life through.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've heard them say a greener land is waiting there where people wake and find their dreams come true.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">High flying dove, please lead me and I'll follow you above the clouds, beyond the stormy sea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I long to share a world of sweet contentment there in that bright land where grows the olive tree.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that everyone in this House recognises the instability that, regrettably, has been latent in Italian politics since World War II. The current government is the 55th Italian government. There has certainly been stability through the bureaucracy and the Bank of Italy. The government itself has been more characteristic of month by month&mdash;if not year by year&mdash;instability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the 55th government since World War II, and without doubt therefore this House wishes the new Prime Minister, Romano Prodi, well. We trust that, in the process, the group of people he has formed into a ministry is able to tackle the problems of Italy to give the Italian people and the European community that surrounds them hope for recovery in the major areas that concern them: unemployment, economic instability and corruption in the public sector. It is hoped that the new government is able to overcome these problems and that, for the sake of the surrounding community, Italy is able to be restored to her proper and effective place within the European community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I must admit there are aspects of the motion moved by the honourable member with which I find myself in disagreement. For that reason, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) be omitted from the motion.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to some of the details of that in a moment. The essential part of the motion that I wish to retain, therefore, is the paragraph which congratulates the government on its win in the election. I suggest that every member of this House would share that sentiment. I point out to my friend the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) that I have difficulties in every circumstance in our telling other countries where to go and how to do it. I suggest that, whatever his views&mdash;philosophic or otherwise&mdash;it is inappropriate for the members of this parliament to tell the Italians or anybody else how they should run their country. For 13 years the honourable member has been a member of a government that did not know <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what to do in this country, yet he is trying to tell others what to do in their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving politics aside, I do not think it is appropriate for us to intervene in the politics of other countries. We have a right and reason to express our good wishes, to express concerns if those politics in any way intervene in our own relations with those countries, and in other ways to speak of our aspirations together. But I do not think it is appropriate for us to tell them how they should pursue their particular policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is also inappropriate for us to talk about the sterility of past governments, whatever their philosophy. This is particularly difficult at a time when, sadly, even this Italian government is not necessarily going to survive, as suggested, because it is a minority government and the alliances upon which it will depend are ones which may or may not survive the political process. The reality of politics in Italy has been such that one cannot be sure of when that will be. So I suggest to this House that it would be far more appropriate if we deleted those particular words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me address a number of issues in the brief time available to me. The first issue is that Italy is demonstrably an important country to Australia. We have many people of Italian descent in Australia. They are excellent Australian citizens and all of us respect the contribution they have made, are making and will make. The nature of our relationship internationally has been one which has seen Italy perhaps subjugated&mdash;if I can put it that way&mdash;to our relations with the European Community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our prime international relationships with Italy have been more in relation to it being a member of the community than perhaps in any other field&mdash;other than in the dialogue apropos of those who are now Australian citizens but of Italian descent. But our relations have always been good. On a number of occasions I have met successive presidents and leaders of the Italian government, as well as leading bureaucrats, all of whom I have found very forthcoming and have made a great contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Italian community makes an enormous contribution in other areas. If one <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="841"> looks at engineering, fashions, general design, architecture, music and the arts, one will see there is little doubt of that significant and ongoing contribution that the Italians make. If one goes back in history, one will see that even our language is based on so much that emanated from Rome. As far as religion is concerned, while the Vatican City is a separate state, the Vatican is the centre of a religion which represents still a majority of Australian people. In so many ways the Italian connection is important to us&mdash;historically and in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But my concern is where Italy goes in its role within the community and how its impact on the community and the relations between the community and Australia affect us. It is in that area that we look very much to Romano Prodi and at the role he is going to play. I was delighted to see the priorities that he gave to his incoming government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that if you look at those priorities and recognise the extent of unemployment, particularly in the south, you see enormous problems in the structure of the country itself. If one talks about unemployment in Europe, one does not talk about unemployment in the spread across all of Europe. Northern Europe, as with northern Italy, has far less unemployment than southern Italy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an enormous problem in those southern communities stretching down into the area where the Mafia has its sway and into Sicily and Sardinia. There is no doubt that southern Italy is in a state of significant lower economic activity than northern Italy. There industry is less and, although there is an availability of labour, the level of education, the level of skill and the level of employment are less than elsewhere. So there is a difficulty in the regional spread within Italy, and I think that is a major problem for Signor Prodi.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next difficulty is the unemployment level. While Australia has a high level of unemployment, we are fortunate in that there are signs, I believe, with the election of the Howard government, of our being able to embark on policies appropriate to generate private sector long-term employment again. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> To my mind, that is another of the failings Signor Prodi is going to face for the future&mdash;if the prejudices of his philosophy are to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he follows only public sector employment, there is little doubt that there will still be a question mark. Is there going to be long-term employment? Is there going to be an opportunity for the recovery of the Italian lira? Is there going to be some prospect of stabilising inflation. Inflation, regrettably, has meant that the value of the lira against other major currencies has fallen significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can get some measure of that if you compare the value of the lira to the American dollar. For example, in 1990 the lira was valued at 1,198.4 and in 1994 it was valued at 1,611.8. In contrast to the pound sterling, the lira was at 2,133.2 in 1990 and 2,467.3 in 1994. In comparison with the Deutschmark, the lira has devalued from 741.6 in 1990 to 994.7 in 1994. When you look at those figures you get some idea of the fundamental problems of a devaluing currency, of high inflation and of high unemployment. Married to all that is the chronic problem of crime, and crime in high places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason I was particularly pleased to see included amongst the new ministers a former prosecutor who played such an important role in prosecuting some of those within the Mafia who over the years have tragically impeded so much on the credibility and the integrity of the public life of the Italian community. That former prosecutor, of course, is Antonio De Pietro, the prosecutor whose drive against corruption made him a national hero. He is to be the public works minister. Public works is an important area. It is an area where corruption has been endemic. One of the priorities of Prime Minister Romano Prodi is to try to reduce the level of corruption in that field. So I feel that that is a very good appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note the high academic qualifications of others within his ministry. Academic qualifications are all very well, but what is far more important is a bit of practical commonsense. I am apprehensive that, unless that practical commonsense is applied, there will be worries for the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="842">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also of interest&mdash;having heard a bit of the ideology of my friend in his moving of the motion&mdash;to look at and compare with the Australian Labor Party the appointments in the Olive Tree ministry. The comment is that women did surprisingly poorly in the share&hyphen;out. A Progressive Catholic, Rosy Bindi, got the health ministry. But both the other women chosen are ministers without portfolio, with obviously contrived responsibilities&mdash;one for equal opportunities and the other for social solidarity, whatever that means. So I am afraid that the socialists, wherever they are, do not seem to think highly of the other sex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Be that as it may, I think the whole of this House welcomes the election of this new government. We wish them well in their significant tasks and trust that, under the guidance of Prime Minister Romano Prodi, Italy can continue to grow and contribute in political affairs as soundly as it has in the arts, music, culture, design, engineering, fashions and other spheres for so many centuries.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has put forward in this motion is extremely moderate. Suggesting that some of this is an interference in the Italian political system is somewhat of an exaggeration. I think even people with the strongest of ill-will would have to recognise that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said earlier, the Italian-Australian connection has been a very powerful one. The contribution of the Italian community to Australian society has been extremely important. In just a few weeks time we will be celebrating the anniversary of the establishment of the republic. On the first Saturday in June the tradition is celebrated in the Hunter. It is a major function and coming together of people of Italian descent and others in the community to celebrate the formation of the republic. Those of Italian descent have a great sense of pride about their contribution to Australia and certainly have an enormous interest in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that a concern to all of us&mdash;people in Italy and people in Australia, people of goodwill&mdash;has been the instability of the Italian government. The fact that the average life of a government has been only 11 months has not been good and not been thought well of. Following the recent election, there is now great optimism that we will see a longer lasting government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst the few matters I should mention in terms of the Australian&hyphen;Italian connection is that in Newcastle we are currently building minehunters for the Royal Australian Navy which are of Italian design and use a lot of Italian technology. A great interchange of skills and depth of understanding has come from Australians going to Italy to learn and bring back technology and Italians visiting and looking at how we are handling this exercise. It has been a very productive exercise, and we look forward to it developing further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion tries to pick up and make us understand that for the first time since the war there has been a left&hyphen;of&hyphen;centre success in an Italian election. That is a major change and major departure. Whether or not that is the first swallow to herald a summer of change is yet to be seen, but certainly what is happening in England post Thatcherism and the now debunking and almost embarrassment of the British parliamentary system and certainly the conservative party&mdash;they are walking away from their now much discredited philosophy&mdash;is interesting.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="843">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening in France is interesting, as is what is happening in America, where we saw the great euphoria with Gingrich and the contract with America suddenly collapsing in one giant heap, and the absolute collapse of the `Dole for President' campaign, so much so that he has now resigned his position to concentrate on his election campaign full time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these things seem to signal to many of us a change from pushing individual greed, from pushing materialism and from pushing the idea of individualism to looking much more at our need to understand and support each other and that parliaments and governments around the world need to govern for all by all, which means thinking of all and allowing people to see themselves as part of communities and the interdependence that is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen for many years, particularly in some of the countries I have mentioned, has been materialistic measuring and countries being run for the economy rather than the people. In Italy the Italian people are now perhaps saying, `We want a country with a government which governs for us and for the economy and works for us&mdash;not separate from us.' Those opposite will see in the next few years that what they are putting forward in their rhetoric may well end up causing here the same surge we have seen in Italy in recent months. I join with my colleague in sustaining the motion. I look forward to Italy having not only a strong, stable government but a government that is caring and committed to all people and governing for people rather than for economics. I think the final paragraph is a valid one. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly support the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and that part of the motion moved by the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) that will be left after this House, if it ever gets the opportunity to vote on this motion, deletes sections (2), (3) and (4) from the motion currently being discussed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say at the outset that I find it interesting to observe members of the opposition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in this place. After 13 years of government, we now find that they are able to come here and be socialists again. When votes on privatisation are taken in the parliament, such as the votes we had a week or so ago in relation to Telstra, we now find members of the Labor Party vote against privatisation, whereas over the last 13 years we have seen many of those same members opposite vote in favour of privatisation. So I think there has been a resurgence of socialism on the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened very carefully, as I always do, to the thought&hyphen;provoking comments from the honourable member for Charlton. I think he was able to come into his own today. He was able to state the sort of view that he would have liked to have expressed during 13 years of government. I congratulate him on his courage, although it is certainly belated courage we see today from the honourable member for Charlton. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) continued in a similar vein.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be churlish of anyone in this place to fail to congratulate the new Italian government. As has been said by previous speakers, it is the 55th government in postwar Italian history. It is quite incredible that governments have lasted on average for only 11 months. The right honourable member for New England pointed out that, while governments may have lasted for only a short period, the bureaucracy and the Bank of Italy have provided continuity, which has certainly been absent from the political process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many respects it would have been better for this country had the Hawke and Keating governments lasted for only 11 months rather than 13 years. If that had been the case, we certainly would not have the wreckage of the Australian economy that we see today. We certainly would not have Beazley's $8 billion black hole. We certainly would not have unemployment as one of the ongoing national tragedies in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="844"> Today we are dealing with this important motion relating to Italy. The members who have previously spoken have indicated the strength of the Australian&hyphen;Italian community and the importance of the enduring connec tion Australia has with Italy. I did, however, find it somewhat interesting when the honourable member for Newcastle defended paragraphs (2), (3) and (4). He said that we have commented on South Africa, Cambodia and Burma. We certainly have, and I am pleased that we have done so. But I do not think one could ever accuse Italy of being in the same category as those three countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Italians have been a very important part of Australia's history. We probably have close to a million Australians today who have some Italian connection. As immigration from Europe declines, undoubtedly the number of Italian born Australians will decline. But when one looks at the impact and contribution of second and third generation Italians, it is very obvious that a substantial connection will continue. It is interesting that the honourable member for Charlton highlights the election victory as an important victory for the political Left. He suggests that the new Italian government is going to achieve what the other 54 governments have failed to achieve since the Second World War.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One ought to appreciate that, while there may have been a multiplicity of governments in Italy, those governments have over the years performed economic miracles. They have certainly rebuilt the Italian economy after the ravages of fascism in the Second World War. Over the years there has been a tremendous growth rate in Italy under conservative leaders. So, while we all join the honourable member for Charlton in congratulating the Olive Tree coalition on its magnificent victory, it ought to be remembered that the government is not stable. It has a bare majority in the lower house. It has a majority in the upper house. The government is a combination of factions. This government could go the same way as other governments. I think we ought to congratulate it and wish it well. We ought to point out to it, though, that socialism is a failed philosophy right across the world. Socialist governments have been collapsing and continue to do so. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I congratulate you on your appointment. This is the first <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opportunity I have had to do so. The amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is a nonsense. He contradicted himself in his own speech. He said that we should not be debating the internal events of other nations. As if we have not done this in this parliament in all the years that he has been here&mdash;and he has lasted more years here than anyone! Then he proceeded to explain what was wrong with the new government and its philosophies. I found that to be a bit curious and to be a contradictory argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Putting that aside, the reason we are persisting with the full motion moved by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is that this signifies a turning point not only in Italian politics but also in Europe. There has been a very strange phenomenon in Europe. There have been primarily conservative governments at the national level; yet at the level of the European Parliament the majority has for some time been with socialists and Left parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This paradoxical situation has arisen, strangely enough, because we have had difficulties in the various leftist and socialist and labour and social democratic groupings, especially in Italy, getting their act together, so to speak, and fighting an election in a coherent way. This is what the Olive Tree coalition did in Italy. They did so on the basis of a relatively coherent platform. It was a moderate, socially democratic platform&mdash;a platform which, nevertheless, put forward some new ideas which are relevant not only for Europe but also for the social democratic movement throughout the world. It is necessary to have not only a political response to the New Right and the onslaught of conservatism that rose out of Britain particularly and Thatcherism but also to have a philosophical and coherent policy response. This is a challenge which we in opposition will face to build further ideas. Although we recognise that there were many positive ideas put forward by the Australian Labor Party, we also recognise the need for change and the need for further development of human thought, especially from a perspective of progressive political ideas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="845">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The performance of the Italian Olive Tree coalition will be watched by all the other major countries of Europe particularly, because they have a very interesting combination of ideas. First of all, they are pro&hyphen;European. They are strongly pro&hyphen;European while, at the same time, wishing to assert the importance of social programs and egalitarian values. They are keen to see a united Europe that is playing its role in the world economy. At the same time, they are interested in ensuring there are social programs that protect the poor, that achieve an egalitarian outcome and that  provide for Italy a basis for its economic, social and cultural future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the Italian community in Australia that is looking at what is happening. All those people who are interested in political developments throughout the world, particularly those of a left or social democratic bent, are interested to see how this coalition is going to put in place a program which is going to work in the context of the international economy and the limitations which the international economy puts into place. The coalition will put forward programs which will protect the poor and which will involve significant redistribution of resources. It will support both the public sector and the private sector&mdash;not, as the right honourable member for New England said, `only the public sector'&mdash;in a balanced way. It is necessary to have this balance, as it forms the basis of what a good society should be. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great admiration for the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). He is a man who has great respect for the institution of parliament, respect for his political philosophy and respect for the democratic process. He is the type of Labor person that I have always admired. I have always thought those from the left of the Labor Party are the true Labor people&mdash;the people who are true to the philosophy on which the Labor Party was built. Sadly&mdash;and I mean sadly&mdash;for the Labor Party, there are not many people left in the Labor Party like the member for Charlton, and we are seeing others like those in the right of the Labor Party, such as the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), the member for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and the former member for Lilley, who are more like political machines than people with a passion for a philosophy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no hesitation in supporting the first part of the motion. Of course, I would offer my congratulations to any political leader and political party which is democratically elected. I should add that it is a coalition of parties, as other speakers have mentioned today, and differences will no doubt come about. I certainly wish the new Italian government well. I must indicate my disappointment that the member for Charlton did not extend his effusive kindness to the Prime Minister of Australia on his magnificent win.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is also to be supported. While I have no hesitation in congratulating the Olive Tree coalition, I welcome the omission of the last three parts of the motion of the member for Charlton. While the member for Charlton wants to recognise the results as the most significant national success of the political Left in Italy since World War II, I would not be too excited about the success at this stage as, given the unstable nature of government in Italy since World War II&mdash;we have already mentioned there have been something like 55 governments&mdash;Lord knows what could be happening in Italy as we speak.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, if one acknowledges that one&hyphen;quarter of the Olive Tree's votes were for the Communist Refoundation Party whose platform has little in common with its coalition partners, then the first hurdle the government approaches where there is a difference of views within the coalition will certainly test the strength of the coalition and the stability of the new Italian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Communist Refoundation Party is dedicated to higher taxes, high government spending on social services, guaranteed employment through state jobs and wage indexation against inflation, and opposes privatisation and development of the European Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Romano Prodi has already ruled out wage indexation and real increases in public spending. That shows the difficulties that will be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="846"> faced by the new government in implementing its program. It requires the support of the Communist Refoundation Party, yet there are differences in their platforms which do not augur particularly well for the stability Italy requires from its government. Italy certainly needs stability and we wish that upon the Italian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the extreme Left is seeking higher government spending on social services&mdash;despite Italy's public debt standing at 124 per cent of gross domestic product&mdash;Prodi has indicated his opposition to this. I must also question whether the Left have been welcomed with open arms by the Italian people when the mastermind of the Olive Tree, Massimo D'Alema, pushed Romano Prodi as the coalition's candidate for premier because he appealed to moderate voters. `Moderate' is one of my favourite words. That, in itself, is an admission by the coalition that the Left was not fully palatable to the Italian electorate when they required a more centrist candidate to be the face of the party while the backroom boy, the person calling the shots, had his political upbringing in the Communist Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The win by the Olive Tree is probably slightly less than magnificent when it requires the amalgamation of eight political parties&mdash;all with differences in philosophy&mdash;to form the party, particularly when the Communist Refoundation Party has already given Romano Prodi 100 days to perform. That is a threat against the government and a threat against the political stability which the motion infers has come to Italy but appears to be only cosmetic. While Romano Prodi needs the support of the Communist Refoundation Party to carry through the coalition's reform program, there is a threat if Prodi does not compromise with the extreme Left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I would welcome political stability in Italy, this motion may be a tad early to celebrate that stability. While I congratulate Romano Prodi, Massimo D'Alema and all members of the Olive Tree on their endorsement through the democratic process, I would not hail it as a victory for the Left or say that it will bring stability to Italy until the government has withstood the test of time. I certainly wish them all the very best.</PARA>

<PARA>The nearest thing to a learning difficulty that most adults in this chamber come to experience is finding their way around the maze of corridors in this building in their first few months as a member. I am sure that many of these, dare I say, lost souls find comfort in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="847"> knowing that help is at hand and that an attendant or others who could assist are only a phone call away. However, imagine for a moment being lost in this great building knowing you are not able to access one person for assistance or, worse still, not having the skills to ask in the first place. Such is the life, frustration and poor skill base of a sufferer of the mental condition commonly known as attention deficit disorder or ADHD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of us know of this disorder not by name but by its consequences. The consequences of ADHD manifest themselves through a number of society's ills. We are all too well aware of increasing school failures, increasingly unemployable people with poor employment prospects, social aggression and vandalism, antisocial behaviour and domestic violence, psychiatric disorders, either diagnosed or suspected, and aggravated sleep and appetite disorders&mdash;and the list goes on. These should not be considered mainstream behaviours of our society. In fact, they are linked directly to attention deficit disorder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ADHD has also been linked directly to communal behaviour. Dr John Yu, the Australia Day Council's 1996 Australian of the Year, called ADHD the hidden handicap in Australia. From speaking with families, sufferers and teachers, this is most appropriate. However, in saying this we must never lose sight of the fact that ADHD sufferers are not necessarily incapable of learning, have lower intelligence or should be considered intellectually disadvantaged. In many cases, the opposite can, and may, apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the evidence already presented over the past two years to this House by me and by others, Mr Deputy Speaker, you do not need me to reiterate that the problem is enormous. In fact, we have only touched the tip of the medical iceberg. On several occasions a number of members on both sides have discussed and debated this, and have offered comments, suggestions and support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the time for rhetoric is passed and we must now put national interests&mdash;the particular interests of children and young Australians&mdash;before the interests of any faction or party, or any personal agenda. This cannot be achieved in isolation. Indeed, in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> many respects we, the elected members of parliament, as the representatives of our respective electorates are only the conduit for community demands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple truth is that the parents of either diagnosed or suspected sufferers should now take up the challenge before them and finally get some real action and some real answers. I hope that for ADHD parents this is the final challenge of what have been many challenges. We all know that it is the loudest voice that gets heard. However, the loudest voice is often not backed by the most people. On many occasions it is the most organised voice&mdash;the voice that uses the media to advantage, the voice that uses networks, associations, friends and family to spread the word&mdash;that is heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents of ADHD sufferers are not yet known for their assertiveness. Their needs are not yet recognised. They are not yet acknowledged for the important role they play in ensuring that their children are not placed on the drop&hyphen;out statistics&mdash;or even worse. These parents often go through great confusion and a feeling of lack of empowerment. They are in a state of frustration, simply not knowing the best thing to do at various times. They are likely to be on the defensive when dealing with the comments and criticism of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Dr Julia Solomon, a leading clinical psychologist with expertise and a passionate interest in ADHD, parents of sufferers now must be more accountable. They must ask for more information about their child's condition; they must ask for and seek out alternatives on how to manage it; they must be treated as partners with teachers in dealing with their children; and they must be given knowledge of the research and theory that validate whatever practices are being used for their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am talking about empowerment for parents and families. Without putting too fine a point on it, parents should consider bringing together all the support groups and forming an ADD action group. It would be a group with members from around Australia, not information deprived but with resources, information and the expertise to deal with ADD and, more importantly, plan strategies <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="848"> for diagnosis and treatment. ADD and ADHD are national disorders. We can no longer pretend that they do not exist. We can no longer label them as yet another yuppie disorder. No longer can we let our children suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this House we can debate the definitions of ADD and ADHD, we can talk about the causes and solutions; but no&hyphen;one can deny that research into ADHD, its causes, symptoms, effects and treatment has snowballed in the last seven years or so. In this time we have established several significant indicators which are accepted as true and on which we base much of our current thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ADHD is a biologically based, often hereditary, neurological development disorder. It affects at least five per cent of children and at least two to three per cent of adults. Some 50 per cent to 60 per cent of children will continue to have the disorder into adult life. Less than 10 per cent of affected Australian children are receiving appropriate medical attention and very few adults receive medical attention. People with ADHD are very likely to suffer from a whole range of disabilities which have adverse effects. Most professionals lack training and experience in this area, and clients and patients are unlikely to obtain the important practical services they require.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On several occasions I have mentioned to the parliament the symptoms of ADHD. These are now part of the public record and are easily accessible. What have yet to be stressed and acknowledged are the depressing conditions associated with this condition. They can significantly affect sufferers in family situations, at school and at work, and in the broader community. We have a long way to go. However, we do need to make a start. This, I believe, is best done in the formative primary school years which are the years when the condition first becomes public, outside the confines of home and family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are aware that ADHD is a neurological disorder linked to human brain development in the first eight years of life and linked to chemical imbalances. There is no education for or information available to parents or teachers which explains a child's neurological development or how to determine the levels <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of neurological development of a child. There is no information provided to parents or teachers on how to note ADHD risk factors and what to do if there are risk factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the tragic results of this lack of knowledge is that, as educators of young children, teachers and parents can be unwittingly producing ADHD problems and learning difficulties which result in the symptoms consistent with the learning disorder dyslexia. I do not for one minute think that teachers or their methods of instruction are at fault but there is an urgent need for teachers to have some knowledge of neuropsychology. This would assist them in understanding more about brain development, which would help them to understand more about the individual learning needs of children. This, in association with learning theories, would go far in their gaining control of the learning environment in the classroom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the education of society remains the responsibility of government, such demands involve a commitment by the government to change and innovate. I believe that Australians rightly insist that the allocation of funds to specific educational needs have adequate justification. Such an allocation must be the outcome of a proper inquiry into the issue by a government committee charged with the responsibility of undertaking a sound assessment of needs, possible outcomes and solutions. It would need to collate available data, consult widely with experts, teachers, families and sufferers; and realistically assess the impact of ADHD on Australians of all ages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of ADHD on our general society appears to be reaching a level which can no longer be tolerated. In my view, an inquiry that would investigate practical remedies to this crippling aspect of the Australian future is urgent. In saying this, I respectfully suggest that the federal parliament give consideration to the problems associated with the disabling condition of dyslexia and ADHD in primary school children; undertake to heighten the awareness of the prevalence of, and adverse learning effects of, learning behaviour and/or attention disorders; and conduct an inquiry through the relevant <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="849"> parliamentary standing committee into these disorders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an important matter. We cannot continue to ignore it. We have had some inquiries on different things. We had some inquiries on truancy last year but did not consider ADD as a factor in truancy. I am calling upon the chairman of the appropriate parliamentary committee to consider an inquiry into this condition because I think it is important for our children. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The problems of dyslexia and attention deficit disorder (ADD) are now well documented. A lot of work has been done, particularly in respect of children at primary school age, both in Australia and overseas. The sooner there is heightened awareness of these conditions among health and education administrators and in society generally, the better we will be able to address the problems. Early identification of the problems is essential and, as with any condition, early treatment is vital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy of the disabilities and, in particular, attention deficit disorder is that the disability is likely to be worse in a stressed or disorganised environment. Those stresses on family life can result from unemployment or from the demands upon a working mother who has a task of maintaining a family and, at the same time, earning a living, which is now a widespread phenomenon. The unfortunate reality is that, as a result of their economic circumstances, it is often the case that families under stress are the least likely to be able to afford appropriate treatment for their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, early screening for the disabilities is essential. The sooner a child is able to access treatment, whether it be behavioural or, if necessary, by way of medication, the sooner a child will be able to adjust to new environments that they confront, such as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a new school environment, and the ability to establish appropriate peer group interaction. The unfortunate reality is that there remains a lack of consistent information for our teachers and there are still no measures in place for early screening of children to identify whether they have these conditions of dyslexia or attention deficit disorder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until a proper diagnosis is made the child, the child's parents, and often the teacher, can come to the conclusion that the child is either unintelligent, naturally disruptive and/or naturally aggressive as a result of these conditions. The tragedy is that the child himself then starts to accept the brand that he has been given and his behaviour becomes a self&hyphen;fulfilling prophesy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Early intervention is essential to prevent that occurring. And, indeed, teachers or school support staff need to be appropriately trained and assured of their legal protections in their role in assisting children with disabilities, including perhaps administering medication. The consequences of not treating these conditions are in many ways self&hyphen;evident. But, for instance, in the case of attention deficit disorder there is considerable literature to indicate the prevalence of persistent social disorder on the part of sufferers. Specifically, it is estimated that between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of untreated ADD sufferers will have an experience with the criminal justice system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps more depressing is the fact that it is well documented that those suffering from ADD who are of a withdrawn or depressed personality will suffer a suicide rate of approximately 25 per cent. Aside from the tragic human cost, the costs to society of not treating these disorders is immeasurable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even when the question is approached from the point of view of our modern obsession with economic rationalism, it is the case that with early intervention and appropriate treatment we can assist these children to become decent, successful and taxpaying citizens. The costs of not addressing the problem are self&hyphen;evident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the point of view of employability, it is accepted that if a child leaves school at the age of 16 or later and has not achieved a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="850"> reading level of age 12&half; to 13 years, they are not going to be employable in anything other than a manual capacity. They will not be able to undertake TAFE courses nor will they be able to undertake trade apprenticeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has just announced a program to develop literacy, which of course is to be encouraged. But such a program cannot be successful in isolation from addressing these significant disabilities of dyslexia and attention deficit disorder because any attempt to address a symptom, namely, illiteracy, without addressing what in many instances will be the cause of the symptom will be ineffective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The failure to properly address these conditions and resultant illiteracy will result in a whole generation leaving school, in this computer age, probably unemployable and may well perpetuate inter&hyphen;generational poverty. The literature indicates that treatment of these conditions may require a three&hyphen;pronged attack, namely, medication, behavioural treatment, together with occupational or special learning assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if a parent is fortunate enough to access such a composite range of treatment, it results in massive costs. It is not unusual for costs of up to $5,000 to be incurred in the treatment of one child. Clearly, poorer families are just not going to have the money available to afford such treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as politicians commonly hear and indeed commonly use, on both sides of this House, the rhetoric of respecting, fostering and nurturing the family unit. The reality is, we seldom do anything constructive in that endeavour. This motion is an exception; it is a genuine attempt to make a difference to traumas confronting not only many children but also many adults and indeed many families as a whole. The honourable member for Cowan is to be congratulated on raising this very important matter on the floor of the House, as clearly greater awareness is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently interviewed a constituent who took her child off the Ritalen medication which had been prescribed because she had heard a well&hyphen;known radio commentator attack the condition of ADD. To use her words, `I took her off it because truck drivers use it.' <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> This little nine&hyphen;year&hyphen;old girl was continuing to eat her school lunch on her own and experience complete peer group isolation without hope of a solution because of cynicism which still exists in society&mdash;a cynicism which is unfortunately exacerbated by many sectors of the media. For instance, Medicare benefits for neurometrics testing were withdrawn last year following an ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> report broadcast on 27 February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the removal of benefits for neurometrics testing we are faced with a ludicrous situation where a similar QEG test, but based on different computer software, remains on the Medicare schedule. It remains so more because it seemed to be outside journalistic scrutiny rather than any more logical analysis. Clearly, such a logical analysis is required and that is sought in this motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need for an inquiry through the relevant parliamentary standing committee as proposed in the motion if only to once and for all jolt the community into addressing these problems. It is wrong&mdash;indeed, it is cruel&mdash;for supposed media experts to attempt to make parents feel neurotic and/or inadequate because their children suffer from these conditions when they are attempting as best they can to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, there is a need to examine the adequacy of assistance provided to parents in terms of the Medicare rebate for both diagnostic tests and medication and the provision of assistance for specialist areas not covered by Medicare rebate&mdash;for instance, psychologists, occupational therapists and remedial teaching experts. There is also a need for appropriate early intervention in our school system which both respects a child's right to dignity and privacy and enables access to appropriate treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about an extremely widespread phenomenon. As the member for Cowan indicated, it is estimated that up to five per cent of children have it. If we do not address these conditions we are losing a significant benefit that we would otherwise gain for this future generation and, indeed, for generations following that. I wholeheartedly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="851"> support and congratulate the member for Cowan on this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By a series of measures the coalition has effectively ended the policy of bipartisanship on immigration and multicultural affairs which has persisted since the time of former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Blow by blow still falls. Hot on the heels of revelations in the leaked cabinet document that Minister Ruddock prepared in which he proposed cuts to the refugee and humanitarian program we now discover that there is to be closure of regional offices and overseas offices in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs which will be draconian in their impact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a minute from the departmental secretary, staff of the department are advised that the department will be moving to close regional offices in Townsville, Newcastle, Chatswood, Wollongong, Sunshine and Geelong. Staff are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> notified that all closures will be given effect to no later than Christmas of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This further blow, which has a much more dramatic consequence than would have been the case had the department remained as it was formerly&mdash;responsible for immigration&mdash;is greater now because of the fact that it is obliged to take over the responsibilities of multicultural affairs. The office that was formerly in the Prime Minister's department has been transferred to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs but with no funding. To confirm that fact, the minute from the office of the secretary provides that these cuts that are being made to the staff&mdash;170 staff members being lost&mdash;are required not only because of the cuts in running costs and savings that were projected by the coalition in the lead-up to the election, but also because they have to make provision for the assumption of responsibilities for the functions of the Office of Multicultural Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have now is a department which is supposed to be able to carry through a program of access and equity which was endorsed by members of both sides of this parliament, including the now minister, without the capacity to do so. Instead of there being offices on the ground throughout regional Australia, we have a suggestion that it might be served by telephone links. But how can it possibly be concurrent with the added responsibilities of the office of the minister that he perform those functions without staff available throughout regional Australia and with the added responsibilities of coordination that his office is supposed to take up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Blow by blow is falling on what was formerly a settled position between government and the opposition. We start with the demise of the Office of Multicultural Affairs, which was intended to be able to coordinate across all agencies of government policies that enabled there to be an effective response to those who come to Australia from other backgrounds, particularly those who still have limited fluency in English. People who have arrived in this country need to be given opportunities to find employment, to make their home here and to prove part of an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="852"> economic success. That is why they have come here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The access and equity strategy, which was endorsed by both sides of this House, cannot be implemented effectively in an environment where the minister for immigration has that responsibility rather than an office with central coordinating functions in the Prime Minister's department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as that, there has been hypocrisy and deceit in relation to the question of those who have believed the coalition's election commitments that there would be no cuts to the humanitarian and refugee program. In fact, there will be a very substantial reduction. The baseline program was 13,000 in the humanitarian program, with 4,000 refugees. It is certainly true that that program was increased by 2,000 to cope with the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, but anyone who was part of the community seeking reassurances from the coalition that they would maintain the humanitarian and refugee program would have understood the coalition's commitment that there would be no reduction to mean that that 13,000 baseline program would stand and the 4,000 refugee component would not be reduced. There is a direct admission from the minister himself in the leaked cabinet document that those assurances can no longer be met. He says in that document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My proposal to reduce the size of the Humanitarian Program, with the consequent reduction in the Refugee component, will bring into question our election commitment `not to reduce the refugee component and to emphasise the role of assisting genuine refugees.'</PARA>
<PARA>Then, of course, the submission canvasses how that breach of the government's election commitment could be camouflaged or best put for public presentation. That is the kind of approach we are seeing now. It is ethically and morally bankrupt. Deceit is being practised in an area where there had previously been bipartisanship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final area where it is crucial that we identify a problem with the administration of this department is in the new&hyphen;arrivals situation. It is certainly true that in the election the coalition flagged that they would be seeking to withdraw the availability of benefits for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> new arrivals, but in their costings they estimated those savings at some $616 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since their coming to office, they would have received information and briefings from the department estimating the savings at substantially less. The brief to the incoming Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) estimates that, rather than $616 million of savings, this will represent $259.1 million of savings, even if accompanied by the most draconian application of a safety net for those whose circumstances unavoidably change. With oncosts, the overall shortfall that the coalition have between their pre-election estimates of savings and those which would appear now to be available to them would be something in the order of $374 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the minister is now being forced to make these draconian and quite uncivilised cuts to programs which no-one in this House could have regarded as justifiable prior to the election. If any spokesperson for the coalition had stood forward before the last election and said that what they were intending to do to the refugee and humanitarian program was to actually propose a reduction to a baseline of 10,000, and next year reduce the refugee component from 4,000 to 3,335, they would have been hounded down. But instead they exercised a deceit on the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is now true that, as a result of the leaking of those documents, their pledges will be maintained, I will be extraordinarily grateful. But the proof of the pudding of that will be whether we see a program which maintains that baseline of a 13,000 humanitarian program and a 4,000 refugee component.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, today's grievance debate is a very sad occasion. In the past, debates on immigration and multicultural affairs have not been occasions, in the main, for a division of this nature and of this bitterness. But that wedge is now firmly in place in the Australian community and it is there because of the deceit and the wrongful and hypocritical approach of the government as it goes about making these savings measures because it got its costings wrong on key policy proposals before the election. The government is having to renege and breach its election commitments <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="853"> after its election. It is an exercise which members on both sides of this House should note and go to the minister and say, `We will not stand for these consequences.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I grieve for all those Australians of whatever age or whatever background who have inadequate literacy skills. I grieve for those children, those young people and those adults who are unable to read or write in English at a standard comparable to their peers or at a level to allow them to fully participate in the life of their nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 36th Parliament, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training brought down two reports which have driven the issue of literacy very strongly throughout the decade of the 1990s. The first of those reports, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Literacy needs in the workplace: words at work</EMPHASIS>, was a report into literacy needs in the workplace. It was a report of literacy inadequacies in our existing adult population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During that inquiry, we interviewed many Australians at many workplaces around the nation and found that far too many Australians had difficulty doing a proper job at work because of their inability to read properly. They had difficulty in being able to fully participate in society because of not being able to access simple things, understanding the language on a television program or going to a movie and completely understanding what the language was all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the inquiry I took the opportunity to ask of everyone who appeared before us: given that we accept we have an unacceptably high level of people in society with poor literacy skills, are we still growing the problem in our schools? Mr Deputy Speaker, I can tell you that substantive evidence was received by the committee that we were then still growing the problem, but no submission and no witness was able to quantify that judgment. A number of submissions and witnesses claimed that a change in teaching <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> methodology in primary school reading programs both had been inappropriate and had acted to put at risk a substantial percentage of students in the first three years of primary school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The literacy challenge</EMPHASIS>, brought down and tabled in May 1993, was a report on the strategies for early intervention for literacy and learning for Australian children. It was, in fact, an inquiry into early language development of our young students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a problem which desperately needs to be addressed: there are far too many Australians who cannot truly participate because they cannot read or write at the level of their peers. In order to address that problem, we need to bring to national attention the exact circumstances of our failure in teaching young people those skills they so desperately need to have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Literacy needs in the workplace: words at work</EMPHASIS>, I recommended that there be a series of national testing beginning at age 7, grade 3, grade 5, and continuing, in order to find out exactly where we stood and, once knowing where we stood, then being able to address the problem. My colleagues on the other side of the committee&mdash;that is to say, the Labor Party members of the committee&mdash;rejected all those recommendations, so I had to bring down a dissenting report. Their rejection, I think, was for ideological reasons which, to some extent, still seem to exist in Australian society today. Those reasons really are encapsulated by the teachers and teacher unions for some reason or series of reasons being unconvinced that testing can occur without testing their ability or their results in transferring knowledge or learning to their students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Literacy skills&mdash;learning to read and learning to write&mdash;are very difficult to acquire. They do not occur naturally. As we grow up at home we learn to speak in the tongue of our parents, and we learn to speak in the tongue of our peers. But there is no set mechanism that teaches us how to transfer the sounds of the spoken word or speech into symbols or the written word that has the same meaning as those sounds. So we have to have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="854"> strategies, methodology, applied from the teacher to the student to direct and help the student grasp the meaning of letters and the meaning of words in writing&mdash;and the ability then to hear words and transform those back onto a piece of paper, or whatever, in written form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The literacy challenge</EMPHASIS>, several of my colleagues and I brought down another set of dissenting recommendations. Once again, those recommendations said that we needed to address this issue of testing in an international sense. We said that two specific things really needed to occur. The first was that all literacy training should include specific instruction in decoding skill acquisition and spelling. We thought it important that students learn how to transform a letter and the sound of a letter, in combination with other letters, into a word and the sound of that word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We further recommended that the Commonwealth finance, through the Australian Education Council, national assessment of reading, writing and mathematic skills for attainment of all primary school students prior to completion of year 3 and that the results of the national assessment be reported. It is important that we as a nation compare ourselves to other nations; that we have some idea of whether our expenditure in educating young people is achieving results. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we do ourselves immense harm by failing even one student, one young person, and denying them what ought to be a basic right of theirs&mdash;to learn how to read and write in the language of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The literacy challenge</EMPHASIS>, my colleagues and I said that it is unacceptable that 10 to 20 per cent of children are finishing primary school with literacy problems; it is also unacceptable that the actual numbers of children with such problems are not known. We were appalled that during the inquiry state, territory and Commonwealth education authorities were unable to tell the committee, with any degree of accuracy, the extent of the problem as it exists in primary schools because most systems do not test basic skills on a systemic basis. It appears, however, that numbers could be as high as 25 per cent of </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>the students. It may represent the majority of school populations in some education districts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to tell the House that, since that report and the national outcry which followed its being brought down, there has been a sea change in terms of acceptance at the state level of some systematic form of testing of literacy skills and at an early age. New South Wales began, under the Greiner government in 1990, to test students at years 3 and 5; Queensland has now begun to do a safety net check of students at year 2 and it tests completely at year 6; the Northern Territory assesses years 5 and 7 in both basic literacy and numeracy; Western Australia is in the process of introducing at primary level a systematic test to back up its anecdotal test, if that is what it can be called, where it surveys teachers and asks for their opinion on how their students are doing; South Australia has, in the last 12 months, introduced at primary level a series of literacy tests amongst a great controversy, largely emanating from the school community; Tasmania now uses basic literacy and numeracy tests at primary level, and that system is currently under review; Victoria, of course, has the LAP test at years 3 and 5; and the ACT is the only one that is missing out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to tell the House that the Commonwealth will now institute a survey form of testing nationally which will encompass 9,000 students across Australia&mdash;4,500 from year 3 and a comparable number from year 5. Five hundred of each group will be Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander students. Parents will have the right to decide whether or not they wish their child to participate. It is certainly hoped at the Commonwealth level that we finally, year after year, begin to build a database on how well we are transferring information to our young students, how literate they are becoming and what chances they will have in the future in terms of jobs and further education.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance relates to the damage being caused to Newcastle and the Hunter <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="855"> Valley by this new government. Before going into detail about individual programs, I want to put in perspective the nonsense being uttered about the deficit. The first point the community must recognise is that $4 billion of the $8 billion deficit comes from the government's uncosted promises. The refusal of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to give details of the finance costings confirms this. If there is not a gap in their costings, why do they not produce them? I will read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  an excerpt of a letter by Fred Argy, Fred Gruen and John Nevile, all distinguished economists, in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  which puts this into perspective. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, it is neither necessary nor desirable to seek to reduce discretionary spending by $8 billion over the next two years simply because the economy is forecast to grow more slowly. If the economy is indeed slowing down, such a policy may well slow it down further and increase unemployment in the short term, while helping neither the fiscal deficit nor the national saving rate.</PARA>
<PARA>Three of the country's most eminent economists are saying that what is being put forward is neither good economics nor good policy. This is also a massive breach of faith. The shadow minister for immigration and multicultural affairs, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), advised the House this afternoon of the impending closure of six offices of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs&mdash;Townsville, Newcastle, Chatswood, Wollongong, Geelong and Sunshine. These offices are in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody north of the Sydney Harbour Bridge who needs to talk to someone from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs will have to go to Sydney. The office in Newcastle, which has a staff of nine, has done an enormous job. They service 50 or more people in person and more than 100 phone calls a day. Those people will now have to go to Sydney to talk to anybody from the department. The idea that they can do it by telephone is a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy that is rampant is reinforced when one recognises that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) took part last year, along with me, in an inquiry into access and equity for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people from non-English speaking backgrounds. At the hearings all over Australia he kept insisting that the previous government was not doing the right thing for the migrant community in terms of access and equity. He is now taking away access for virtually one million people. Townsville is further from Brisbane than Brisbane is from Canberra and yet that office is closing. Why does the minister not close the Brisbane office and have the people there deal with Canberra? That is the next step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government spent years building and establishing services for regional communities and it is not an understatement to say that that is all being wound back. Let us look at other areas. We hear the throwaway line about the 12 per cent cut to university funding. The university in Newcastle has a budget from the Commonwealth of about $130 million a year. A 12 per cent cut in funding to that university amounts to about $15 million. The effect that will have on jobs in Newcastle will be enormous, let alone the effect it will have on academic standards and confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working Nation provided about $130 million to help the long-term unemployed in the Hunter. The projected cuts in that respect are in the order of $20 to $30 million. That also means a reduction in the number of people employed to run the program as well as, more importantly, a reduction in the number of people the program helps. We saw the appalling performance today in terms of barrier controls for the Customs Service. Newcastle is a major port. The Customs Service is being cut even further. We have argued for years that it has been cut too much already. This government is talking about being good managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the life of the previous government the number of Commonwealth public servants employed in my electorate alone increased by 1,300. On my estimation, between a quarter and a third of those will now go. They were permanent jobs that employed locals. Graduates of our university could actually stay in Newcastle and work rather than go to Sydney. This government has the hide to talk about the fact that they represent regional Australia. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="856"> When those in regional Australia understand what they are about&mdash;when they understand this slash and burn philosophy and ideology&mdash;they might change their minds about how wise they were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea that somehow this is all necessary because of economics is absolute nonsense. These decisions were made years ago. This is not some reaction to present circumstances. Canberra will be frozen up until post&hyphen;budget. Who in Canberra is going to buy a car, a house or spend any money by choice when in August their jobs may go? They are jobs in the public sector as well as the private sector. Business people are not going to make decisions until they know what the budget involves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody associated with any of the Commonwealth programs, departments, universities or services in Newcastle will hold back. Those three professors pointed out this morning quite aptly that this kind of policy will slow down the economy further, create more unemployment and create more panic. Why on earth would a new government set out to frighten everybody for the next four months? What is the logic behind that? What is the policy behind that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea of trying to hide behind some mantra about a black hole deficit is not biting out there and it lacks credibility. The fact that these professors put their names on a letter to a newspaper confirms that. If this government had any economic credibility at all we would not have these three professors putting themselves forward in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing is ideology gone berserk. We are seeing an approach to the Australian economy of slash and burn which has long&hyphen;term consequences and really does bring into question the understanding and philosophy of those opposite. I watched with great interest the first speeches of so many people from regional Australia and I watched them espouse how their government was going to help. What I want to tell them now is that, back in 1986, a previous minister for immigration made a similar decision, and the backbenchers from regional Australia had it reversed. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was announced that the Newcastle office for immigration, as it was then, and for ethnic affairs was to be closed in 1986 in the budget. That decision was reversed because we would not tolerate it. I suggest that those on the back benches of the government now should have enough gumption to do the same thing as we did 10 years ago. If they do not, the long&hyphen;term effects of contracting services back to capital cities will be both morally and ethically wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People living in Newcastle are entitled to a service&mdash;as they are in Maitland, Cessnock or anywhere else up the valley. To go to Sydney to talk to a departmental officer is impossible for many people. As for the idea of doing it by telephone, I refer members to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the parliamentary inquiry when the now minister was questioning people about the suitability of telephone services for ethnic affairs. Look at what he was saying and what he was asking when he was questioning them about the efficiency of the telephone translation service. He has got the hide to come forward now and say that not just interpreter services, which are complex and difficult to provide, but also fundamental migrant visas, extensions of visas, applications and sponsorships&mdash;all those things which are so day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day that people see access to them as a fundamental right&mdash;will be gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as that, of course, they are plugging away at all the other ethnic community support services which the department does so well. These people are good people. They have done a great job in my part of the world. They deserve to stay there&mdash;and, just as importantly, the people deserve that service. For this government to stand there and posture the way it does is in fact hypocritical. I suggest to the people in the government who live in regional Australia that you should watch out, because your services are going, in the same way as ours have been marked for closure. As they start to go, do not start lecturing us about the reasons. The reasons are the ideology of the cabinet. If you do not sort them out soon, the question of who controls whom is well and truly answered. Today is a day of enormous grievance, and people in Newcastle and the Hunter will be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="857"> absolutely outraged when they realise what has been decided by the minister and by this absolutely hypocritical government.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to grieve today about the legacy left to my constituents by Labor governments, both federal and state. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) was talking about what has to happen, and was complaining about the impact of what has to happen; but of course it has to happen because of what his previous government did. I want to talk about what has to happen and its impact on my constituents, and I want you to be well aware of some of the impact that his government has caused this government to have to make. The reality is that when you are going bankrupt you have got to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My experience is that Labor governments around the world, not just federal and state, all seem to have the same fatal flaw. I come originally, of course, from the UK&mdash;as many in this chamber will know.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UT4">Mr NUGENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the Westminster Council was a very good example of not being able to balance the books, and I thank the honourable gentleman from Reid for reminding me of it. But I also was brought up and lived much of my adult life through, for example, the Labour years of the Wilson government. The whole process of the Labour Party in the UK was one of levelling down of doctrine rather than one of results. In fact I suppose I could even describe myself as, to a certain extent, a refugee from the Labour governments of the United Kingdom. That was not the only reason that I came here; there were very positive reasons too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate of Aston, in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne, has a lot of young families, a lot of young people who need jobs, and a lot of small businesses. These are the very areas that the previous government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in fact attacked quite viciously in terms of the policies that they implemented. Victoria sustained bad government not only from the previous federal Labor government but also from the previous state Labor government, the Cain&hyphen;Kirner government, which tried very hard to bankrupt the state. Jeff Kennett and his government have spent a lot of time&mdash;and there has been a lot of pain for the people&mdash;sorting out that mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To talk about federal issues, what we see from the previous federal Labor government are unemployment rates in my electorate that are 658 per cent higher than when the Labor Party came into power. Twenty&hyphen;eight per cent of youth are unemployed in my area. The impact on mature&hyphen;age people who have lost their jobs through all the small business closures has been quite a damaging social phenomenon. Small businesses have been struggling. There have been record bankruptcies, and the high interest rate regimes have been absolutely disastrous as well. There have been a whole host of problems associated with the social welfare situation and the inefficiencies and the inequitable way in which it has operated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It all means that not only have we had those problems in the community but we have also come to government and found the $8 billion black hole. I am not going to go again through the pros and cons of that, as it has been well rehearsed in this place; but there is a need to stop the debt getting worse.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been gone through repeatedly and in great detail. For the benefit of the member for Chifley, I refer him to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  where the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has given a very detailed and very explicit explanation of what the $8 billion black hole is&mdash;Beazley's black hole&mdash;an explanation which, when you were in government, your government was not prepared to do before the election, I would remind you. What that means is that a number of programs, which are good programs, might well come under review, and I want to spend much of my time this afternoon talking about a couple of those programs. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="858">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already announced that we will be, unfortunately, having to do away with the DIFF program. It will be a sad day for Australia when the DIFF program, which is the development finance structure part of the aid program&mdash;in other words, soft loans to overseas countries where they use Australian companies to implement projects&mdash;is abandoned. A company called Data Electronics in my electorate has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were about to finalise a contract to supply $4.5 million of flood monitoring equipment to the Ministry of Water Resources in China.</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cancellation of DIFF means that we will no longer be able to compete with European, US and Japanese companies who have this type of aid funding available to them.</PARA>
<PARA>If it were not for the disastrous state of the economy that the previous government left for this government, we would not have to be cancelling this sort of project. The member for Chifley, instead of sitting there now making a lot of hot air, would have been better advised making sure that his government kept the country solvent when they were in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only a question of DIFF itself and the damage that is doing to companies in my electorate and elsewhere across the country. Of course, the mere fact that we have to take these sorts of measures is not going to do our relationship with other countries, particularly around Asia, any good either. For example, an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of just a few days ago talked about the scrapping of DIFF drawing a backlash from Asia, and a number of countries are complaining about that. The reality is, of course, that this is a result of your inheritance. You should face up to it because you have actually caused the country damage in the past and there is an ongoing legacy which we are going to have to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from DIFF, of course, there is also some speculation about the EMDG scheme. I do not know whether EMDG is going to be affected in the budget on 20 August. Of course you do not know, in the same way that I do not know, but there has been speculation. I want to make some comments about EMDG <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because it seems to me that that is another scheme, if it comes under the hammer, that will be directly attributable to the financial shambles that the other side left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a company in my electorate called Jardan Design Pty Ltd, which manufactures furniture. Jardan is a manufacturer of high quality furniture and it distributes it right throughout Australia. In May last year, it was successful in obtaining its first major export order to Japan. That represented a shipment of two 40&hyphen;foot containers per month. That has given the company confidence to expand its product line and concentrate more of its efforts towards developing and expanding its potential markets in South-East Asia. It was pleased to report, in a letter to me recently, that this has already resulted in orders from five new export customers in the past year. From its point of view, therefore, it has been able to put on additional employees and grow its business, and that growth in its business is going overseas. It has been able to do this with the assistance that it received through Austrade and its eligibility for EMDG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that, if we have to take financial measures in respect of programs like DIFF and EMDG, we need to make sure that it is clearly understood in the community that these are not things that we want to do but things that we have to do because of the financial irresponsibility of the previous government. That is not just a general political point. It will have an actual impact on the constituents in my electorate, it will affect real jobs in my electorate, as we clear up the mess that has been created by the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the problems of finance that the other side left behind for us, there are a couple of other things I would mention that were major omissions in their administration that affect my constituents. The first is their failure to effectively deal with issues such as dementia. I have a number of retirement villages in my electorate and one of the concerns is that we just do not have adequate facilities for dealing with people with dementia. Although I have an overwhelmingly young electorate, obviously an increasing proportion of it is getting older. Dementia has to be dealt with in any community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="859">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw with the previous administration that you could be either in an aged persons' hostel and there was one rate of support or in a nursing home and there was a different rate of support. But, if you wanted to be in a specific dementia unit which does not require as much money as a nursing home but requires more than a hostel, you could not get special funding; you could get only the hostel rate of funding. In my electorate we actually closed dementia units because of the failure of the previous government to adequately finance those sorts of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, and in many electorates across the country, there has been an impact on my constituents as a result of the measures that we have had to take due to the legacy we have inherited. There has been an impact on my constituents as a result of what the former government did which will last in my electorate for many years to come. I can assure this House that the Liberal government will have the courage to come to grips with these things, to get the budget back into balance, to deal with the issues of debt and to free up the business community to make sure that we actually start to get this country thriving yet again.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) has provoked me into making a few responses. The new government has come in talking about wanting to lift the standards of parliament. I think it is important therefore that we on both sides of the House speak with some veracity about the matters that we wish to contribute to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think a lot of people might have sympathy with the honourable member for Aston if he referred to the Prime Minister's legacy in 1983 after having been briefed by Treasury that there was a $9.6 billion overspend in his budget. In equivalent terms today, that is $25 billion of overspend. When you talk about this $8 billion, of course this is not an overspend but, rather, a forecast, a projection, by Treasury of the likely outcome. The Reserve <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bank has not sent us a note to say, `Look, you're in overdraft, you're overspent.' This is a projection by Treasury of the likely outcome, and it has already refined it downwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made much of this sort of charter of accounting honesty that they are going to introduce as a result of their budgets. If they are so concerned about accountability, honesty and veracity, why won't they table&mdash;as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has said&mdash;the costings of their election promises? And is it true that up to $4 billion of the amount of money they are talking about is direct election commitments made by the present government during the election? I do not think it does us any good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Aston is very interested in industry policy, particularly the IT industry. It is an absolute tragedy for Australian exporters that the government is going to cut out DIFF funding. Our DIFF funding is not as good as the soft loans from America, Japan and Germany. We are already at a competitive disadvantage with DIFF, but we are going to eliminate DIFF. We are saying to Australian exporters, `Your pricing has got to be so keen that you'll get no DIFF funding from us, so you're going to have to lower your price to be competitive for that, and then you've got to beat the DIFF funding from other countries who are bidding for projects.' We have already read in the paper that the patrol boat project in the Philippines is in jeopardy with its follow on orders. I suspect that the $2 billion patrol boat project with Malaysia is in difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Aston also mentioned the EMDG program that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull), who is at the table, often spoke about when he was in opposition. Again we are putting our exporters at a competitive disadvantage. This will cut Australian jobs, cut back Australian industry and make it even more difficult for us economically. This is one of the most short&hyphen;sighted approaches to industry policy issues I have ever seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="860"> I want to talk about a by-election for Blacktown council that occurred in my elec torate on 11 May. I want to congratulate Tony Bleasdale, who is the successful ALP candidate. He has already taken his place on the Blacktown council. We fought a very difficult campaign. We had the Deputy Mayor, Charlie Loudes, as a campaign director and a team comprising councillors Danny Mackin, Peter McAlister and Allan Shearan. They were all working together to develop policies and approaches that Tony, as the candidate, took to the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tony was a great candidate because straightaway he was out there listening to what people wanted. We developed a very grassroots campaign. At a time when at a federal and state level perhaps we on this side are not travelling as well as we might, we scored a six per cent swing, which is a great testament to Tony as a candidate and to all our members and supporters of the party who rallied behind it magnificently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the campaign, one of the issues that the Liberal Party raised was the proposition that Blacktown council should not fund a chair of construction and building services for the Nirimba site, an educational precinct comprising the University of Western Sydney, TAFE and two senior high schools. As far as I am concerned I have always been excited by the Nirimba educational precinct, even though it is in the electorate of my colleague and friend Frank Mossfield, the member for Greenway. It has been one of the most exciting projects for Blacktown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding a chair of the university for building and construction sciences is quite appropriate. Blacktown is the largest local government area in New South Wales. It has about 30 per cent of its land still underdeveloped. It has been a high growth area for a long time. There are heaps of people involved in the building and construction industry or who are owner-operators in the building and construction industry. With a professor, we not only get the teaching value of the professor developing courses but also get the research which will be of direct benefit to companies in Blacktown and in the western suburbs region generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people feel that the people of Blacktown should not have a university; it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should go to other, nicer places in Sydney. But we are really proud about our historic role in fighting for the University of Western Sydney and, more recently, obtaining this educational precinct. It really makes a positive contribution to the quality of life of our residents and provides opportunities for our younger population there. The benefit of the chair is that all you are really paying is the start-up costs. Our council has already announced the figure of $100,000 a year for five years and has put some of the money aside. It is currently re-evaluating it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The council gets the value of the start-up costs because, once it has funded it and it raises the money for five years, it goes on in perpetuity. Council does not have to make any further commitment to that chair. It is not permanently tied to the recurrent funding of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an argument about whether council should be involved in funding university chairs. I well recall that one of the great programs we had in government was the local government capital works program, which was federal money going directly to fund the capital works of councils who had high unemployment in their areas. If we had adopted that attitude, Blacktown council would never have received the $7 million that it did under the program and we would never have seen the jobs that were completed with that $7 million being completed, as they are now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very confident that when council reconsiders this issue it will take a long-term approach and it will make a commitment to Nirimba and to fund this chair. I am sure that when we look back in, say, 10 or 20 years this will be seen as an excellent decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the Liberal Party campaigned strongly against providing the chair. But, as I say, in the by-election we got a six per cent swing. So, if you want to take the marketplace of public opinion, there is no better way than actually getting people to vote on an issue. Overwhelmingly&mdash;the Liberals ran third&mdash;the people rejected this Liberal view that Blacktown should not fund the chair. Last but not least I should make the point that council made a commitment in its 1994 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="861"> budget speech, and it is very bad to break a promise or break commitments.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.16 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An inheritance is usually accompanied with a high sense of expectation and sometimes brings a sense of joy and some financial reward to someone. It can be quite unexpected. A distant relative or a friend departs this world after a long lifetime of service and perhaps thinks kindly enough about another person to leave them a few dollars or a favourite family keepsake. Today I want to talk about what the former federal government, the Keating government, left as an inheritance to the Howard government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have inherited from the previous Labor government gives me no joy and the rest of Australia absolutely no joy whatsoever. After 13 years in office, they left us with high unemployment. Over 730,000 Australians are still out of work and wanting a job but cannot get one. To this we can add 1.3 million Australians who are either underemployed, want to work a bit more work and are available or are engaged in other activities and have been discouraged from seeking a job. Youth unemployment in my electorate is getting close to 30 per cent. It has been higher than that figure. Hopefully, we will be able to address that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to look at the high foreign debt that has been left to us by the former government. After 13 years in office, the net foreign debt is in excess of $180 billion. Add to that over $87 billion in foreign equity and Australia's net liabilities to the rest of the world now total over $267 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">High interest rates are another inheritance from the Keating government. When we came to office, Australia had the second highest bank prime rate amongst developed nations. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We also had low national savings. Our national savings figure was lower than that at the depths of the 1982-83 recession. Household savings are also at historic low levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have a poor growth record. In the 17 quarters after Labor's recession, our economy grew by 16.8 per cent. In the 17 quarters after the 1983 recession, it grew by 21.9 per cent. We also have lower living standards, and with those lower living standards our world per capita income ranking fell from 10 to 22 in the 10 years to 1993. Poverty and income inequality are worsening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming into office we are also faced with an $8,000 million budget deficit. To put that deficit into proportion, a person would need to win the Lotto every Saturday night of the year for the next 52 years to balance the books. I think that gives people in the community an appreciation of the task that the Howard coalition government has ahead of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the inheritance again. What we have been left with by the former government is a very difficult situation. We will have to deal with the high unemployment rates. That is not going to be easy. I was interested in the comments by the member for Chifley (Mr Price) about the performance of his former government, the Keating Labor government, but there was very little mention of the difficulties that he has left us with and which we have to cope with in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current account deficit and foreign debt have forced up interest rates, which are very high by international standards&mdash;a testament to our worsening international position. We have the second highest bank prime interest rate amongst the nations that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> surveys. Average monthly loan repayments have risen by nearly 50 per cent over the Labor government's term in office. Many Australians have seen the value of their most prized possession, the family home, fall in value. They are being squeezed by high interest rates and falling home prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have declining incomes. Real wages have fallen by over one per cent over the last 13 years. Inequality of income and poverty have worsened, and those on the lowest incomes have seen their earnings fall <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="862"> the most. Middle Australia has found it harder to make ends meet and save for the future. Poverty, inequality, unemployment and underemployment remain the greatest causes of social misery in our community. Poverty and inequality are worsening. They are the greatest obstacles to opportunity, security and full participation in Australian life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That message was brought home very clearly to me during the 1996 federal election campaign. When I was handing out how-to&hyphen;vote cards at some polling booths in my area on the morning of the election, almost every woman voter who passed me going into the booths to vote whispered to me, `Mr Reid, the coalition must win office. We are absolutely desperate.' I think that was the clearest message I have ever received in my political life of just what a mess the former government left Australia in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have tried to detail some of the problems, but there are many more of course. The major problem that we have immediately on our agenda is trying to overcome the Beazley black hole&mdash;the $8,000 million budget deficit which was left to the coalition to overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This business has all the shades of the Cain&hyphen;Kirner regime when I served in the Victorian parliament. When that government went out of office in 1992, it left Victoria with a $42,000 million debt. It came to pass then that the Kennett government had to come in and make some very difficult decisions to try to get the budget balanced and to overcome some of the debt in Victoria. Obviously, we are going to have to go through some of the same exercises at a federal level if we are to overcome the $8,000 million budget deficit created by the Keating government and left as an inheritance to all of the people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficult part about this is all of the broken promises of the previous government and the expectation of what it might be able to do for the Australian community. It was very clear when they were making those promises that they would not be able to fulfil them&mdash;they had no possible hope of keeping them. It was simply an exercise of telling the community, `We will promise all of this. Then after the election, if we are fortunate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enough to be elected, we will immediately break all the promises again&mdash;as we did with the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, the community saw through that ploy and elected the coalition to govern this country and to put the economy of this country back on the rails. That task is going to be difficult. We have been left this inheritance by the Keating government: this is what Labor left the Australian people. It is now our task to address the $8,000 million deficit. There will be some tough decisions to be taken to bring that budget back into balance over the next two years&mdash;and it is all due to Labor's failure&mdash;but those decisions have to be made if Australia is to prosper in the years ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, the $8,000 million budget deficit has a $180 billion foreign debt attached to it as well. Labor has left a  negative inheritance for this nation and its children. The debt that is attributable to every man, woman and child from the $8,000 million alone is over $400 per head, and we are now faced with a $10,000 million interest payment each year. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.26 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to share with members of the House my concern about the transfer of nursing home beds from a state controlled nursing home in my electorate. Cessnock's Allandale Nursing Home is the town's largest single employer. The home has a reputation for delivering the highest standard of aged care and has provided the training for many of the Hunter's aged care providers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The home has trained many of the town's tradespersons. On that basis, it plays a significant role in employment in the area. The home has also trained many support staff and employs many staff who work in such areas as domestic services and food provision. It employs about 400 people and, until recently, had more than 400 nursing home beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hunter Area Health Service is transferring by stealth nursing home beds from Allandale to private providers of aged care, most of whom lay outside my electorate. It is the intention of the Hunter Area Health <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="863"> Service to reduce the size of Allandale Nursing Home to 230 beds. The justification given for the transfers is the attempt by the Commonwealth and the states to more equitably distribute the nursing home beds available throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Cessnock local government area, the Hunter Area Health Service would argue, has an oversupply of nursing home beds. This is based on that historic formula I know most members would be familiar with&mdash;that each area should have about 40 nursing home beds for each group of 1,000 people aged 70 or over. On this basis Cessnock does have an oversupply, on face value, of nursing home beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Cessnock's Allandale Nursing Home provides accommodation for many people outside the local government area. On that basis, the suggestion that we have an oversupply of nursing home beds is ill-founded. Indeed, up to 80 persons in the local government area aged 70 or over are waiting for a nursing home bed at Allandale at any one time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have read the Gregory report and I am familiar with the challenges the Commonwealth faces in terms of the ever growing expense of providing aged care to an ever ageing population. I am also familiar with the need to change the ratio of nursing home beds and hostel places to provide for the most efficient distribution of funding in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also aware that, in the early 1990s, the Commonwealth and the states reached an agreement whereby the states would transfer the control of nursing home beds&mdash;those that were left with the states at that time&mdash;to the Commonwealth. In terms of the aged care strategy, this may be okay and may seem more than reasonable. But the way that this policy is being implemented in the case of Allandale is nothing short of scandalous, and my reason for suggesting that is twofold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hunter Area Health Service argues that, of the 400&hyphen;odd beds at Allandale, 200 or so would be accommodating people outside the local government area, as I just said. They would argue that as a consequence, if you take 200 away, you really have not reduced the number of beds available to Cessnock area <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> residents because they were always being filled by people from outside the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a catch. Allandale Hospital, because of its experience, its expertise and the professionalism of its staff, provides very special care. It accommodates many residents and many patients who are not wanted by the private providers. These very highly dependent people are put in the too&hyphen;hard basket, and it is always Allandale which is required to accommodate them. These people will continue to be sent to Allandale from outside the Cessnock local government area, so it is folly to suggest that you can take away from Allandale Nursing Home some 200 beds without there being an adverse impact on the waiting list for nursing home beds in the Cessnock local government area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another reason why I suggest that the way in which the policy is being implemented is scandalous is the impact it will have on the Cessnock local government area economically. Members would, I know, be aware that unfortunately the Cessnock local government area already has a higher than average rate of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. I have already mentioned that Allandale traditionally has been not only the provider of jobs for apprentices and, therefore, our local tradespersons but also the provider of jobs generally for first&hyphen;time school leavers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hunter Area Health Service is telling us that everything will be okay and that no person will lose their job at Allandale as a result of the transfer of these beds. I have difficultly in coming to terms with that. I do not know where the Hunter Area Health Service is going to place a lot of these people, particularly those categorised as List B registered nurses, who, according to some, do not have any contribution to make outside the area of aged care and cannot be accommodated in other areas where the Hunter Area Health Service provides services, such as surgical support, et cetera. I have a great deal of concern not only for the List B registered nurses, who are very fearful about their future, but also for people generally who will be affected by these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beds are already being transferred and wards are closing. As a result of the closures, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="864"> long&hyphen;term residents are being moved to other wards or out of the hospital entirely. Over a period, the residents of these nursing homes and their families build great relationships with the nursing staff. You have to remember that many of these patients are suffering from dementia. Moving them around to different wards is a very scary experience for them. This is not something we should be imposing upon people who have worked hard to make this country the great place it is. I do not think this is the way we should be treating them, and it certainly is not a way of expressing our thanks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What can be done? I understand that this is a difficult issue. As I said earlier, we are talking about an agreement, in writing, made between the Commonwealth and the states in early 1990 which has already been implemented in most states. It is difficult to suggest to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) that, while it is okay for this to have taken place in other states and in other regions, we should make a special case for Allandale. Maybe we can. Allandale nursing home is certainly the biggest nursing home in my state and, I suspect, the biggest nursing home in the Southern Hemisphere, so it is a special case. We should be taking into account the fact that such a hefty transfer of beds is going to impact on the users of the facility and the economic make&hyphen;up of the town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have written to the minister seeking some action on this matter. I am still awaiting a response. I have specifically asked that a moratorium be placed on the transfer of beds from Allandale until the parties involved have had the opportunity to express their concerns and views to the ministers for health at both Commonwealth and state levels. Surely some accommodation can be made for these people. I appeal to the minister for health to respond to my representation, to impose a moratorium, and to set up some dialogue with the states so that he can understand the impact this decision is having and we can have an opportunity to be heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some suspicion about the way in which some of these transfers are taking place. An article in Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> suggested that some private providers of aged care are being forced to accept Allandale beds before 30 June. If this is all about the provision of aged care, what transfers before 30 June have to do with it I will never know. It makes the whole thing stink a little. I am very suspicious of the process, and I appeal to the minister for some assistance.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.36 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to express my dismay and disbelief at Premier Carr's decision last month to refuse the go&hyphen;ahead for North Ltd's Lake Cowal gold project. I know that the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks)&mdash;whose electorate, like mine, also borders the lake where it was proposed that this mine take place&mdash;has also expressed public concern about this incredible decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lake is situated between West Wyalong and the town of Forbes. North Ltd is a company renowned in Australia, with about $1,600 million of assets and 52,000 shareholders. It has been exploring for gold in this area since the early 1980s and has spent almost $20 million in this area. It has identified 40 million tonnes of ore containing about 1&half; grams of gold per tonne&mdash;about 1&half; parts per million&mdash;which means that you need to process about 25 tonnes of ore to get enough gold to make a wedding ring. North Ltd hoped that, out of this mining operation&mdash;if it could have gone ahead&mdash;it would have mined two million ounces of gold, earning $1,200 million worth of export income for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That would have put it not only in the top 10 goldmines in Australia but would have made it the No. 1 goldmine in New South Wales. They intended to mine 230,000 ounces a year for the first seven years of the mine's life, then 102,000 ounces for the remaining four years. The gold is contained in volcanic sediments. It is a very large low&hyphen;grade deposit. It goes back about 460 million years. It was proposed to be mined by an open cut operation of about 800 metres diameter and about 220 metres deep. About half of the open cut would have gone out into the lake but the lake would have been protected by an impermeable protection bund. The gold would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="865"> have been treated on&hyphen;site with cyanide. That would have gone out into four tailings ponds about a kilometre from the edge of the lake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until recently very few people, apart from the locals, had even heard of Lake Cowal. It is dry 30 per cent of the time. When it is full it is only three metres deep. It is largely privately owned by farmers around the area who, when the lake is dry, graze and crop the lake. If you look at photographs of the lake you can see river red gums growing in the middle of it, and fences and roads running backwards and forwards across it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trees in the middle of the lake, because it is dry some of the time, are alive. There is a breeding habitat of some significance for birds, which would be approximately five kilometres from where the proposed open cut would be. I say all this to show, if nothing else, that Lake Cowal is not the New South Wales answer to Kakadu. This is very much a shallow lake which has been dry for over 30 of the last 100 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">North were proposing to mine there. They were going to spend $180 million to develop this mine. When it got going, it would have involved 180 jobs directly, with about another 180 indirectly. The wages of the miners would have averaged about $60,000 each and, over 11 years, that would have put $132 million into the economy. Of course, North were hoping to find more gold than has already been proved, as is usually the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you that towns like West Wyalong and Forbes were very much looking forward to this because they have been through one of the most severe recessions they have ever experienced. But what happened? I was sitting watching <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> on 7 April and, at the end of the program, Bob Carr came on and announced that this mine would not go ahead. It was not until three days later that North Ltd, the mining company, was even told officially that this was to be the case. Bob Carr and Minister Knowles, who is the Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning, have not even been to the site to look at it. It is an absolutely extraordinary situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is incredible. They knocked it back on the report of Gabrielle Kibble, the director&hyphen;general of the department and a daughter of Sir John Kerr. It was a 4&half;&hyphen;page report&mdash;not even on a letterhead, for heaven's sake&mdash;that went against all the scientific findings. I will come to that in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to that, North had spent $2 million on a four&hyphen;volume environmental impact statement and a fauna impact statement which had taken eight years to draw up. That was presented in August last year but was put aside. The Premier, Bob Carr, set up a commission of inquiry which sat in December and January, presented a 120&hyphen;page report to the Premier and took 118 submissions. The committee was chaired by the Chair and the Deputy Chair of the Office of the Commissioners of Inquiry for Environment and Planning, William Simpson and Kevin Cleland. These are top people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very best people were appointed to the inquiry and they said they were totally satisfied that the show should go ahead, that all the concerns had been addressed and that there were really no worries. It was an excellent report by any standards. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contrary views of some parties are not supported by the evidence.</PARA>
<PARA>One of those parties was the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which had said the mine should not go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There we have a 120&hyphen;page report recommending the mine should go ahead, with $1,200 million for Australia; 180 jobs directly over 11 years&mdash;$60,000 a job&mdash;and the Premier comes out on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>, without even having the courtesy to tell the company, and announces that it will not go ahead&mdash;purely on the report of this woman, Gabrielle Kibble. The experts have looked at her 4&half;&hyphen;page report&mdash;I have a copy in front of me. They have rebutted it point by point. By any stretch of the imagination she has put up a very shallow report. It is full of half&hyphen;truths. It has twisted the facts. It misunderstands the science and, above all, it is totally inaccurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She says that because there is some risk&mdash;because it cannot be said there is no risk&mdash;the mine cannot go ahead. What an extraordinary standard to put on a mine. It would mean that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="866"> every mine in the country should shut down if this standard were to apply. It would mean that we would have to ban cars because there is some risk of people being run over or killed in car accidents, and so on. She does not even have the decency to put out a report on departmental letterhead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet the Premier put more weight on this report than on his commissioners' report which was scientifically based and 120 pages long. It is an extraordinary situation we have reached in New South Wales where the Premier, chasing the green vote in Sydney, has totally dismissed work for 180 people directly and another 180 people indirectly. It also means that $1,200 million of export income is just thrown away. Even worse, the environmentalists&mdash;the scientists who have looked at this area&mdash;appreciate that there are rising water tables near the lake, and they have high saline levels. North Ltd were prepared to put $2 million towards that to redress the problem. The Mayor of West Wyalong, David Bolte, says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Premier's decision has not saved the environment at Lake Cowal, but has put it at greater risk from rising groundwater salinity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been studies carried out that indicate the lake could be saline in 20 years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Premier will do nothing about that. They have lost the chance of having $2 million donated to save the environment in the area simply because the Premier has been chasing the green vote in New South Wales. It is a totally irresponsible decision by any measure and should be absolutely and thoroughly condemned. I believe that the Australian people, particularly in the electorates of Parkes and Riverina and the state electorates in those areas, will remember that at the next election.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Mr GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is indeed quality, and I acknowledge that interjection from my side. But a special significance is evident in these bills this year because they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="867"> posit such a stark contrast between the pattern and the scale of expenditure that is provided for under them, based as they are on continuity with the past and a continuation of our forward estimates, and, on the other hand, the forthcoming budget bills with the massive expenditure reductions that are there proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Usually, oppositions support these supply bills. There was one spectacular counter&hyphen;example we can all remember a few years ago. But I support, on behalf of the opposition this year, these bills with particular enthusiasm. And I do so because we strongly believe that continuity, with our own forward estimates of the kind that is enshrined in these particular bills, is a proper basis for the 1996&hyphen;97 budget&mdash;not the manic slash and burn approach that is now being proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills do provide an ideal opportunity to expose the significance of the budget cutting process that is now under way, because I think it is not yet even now wholly appreciated just how wrong&hyphen;headed, misguided and indeed potentially disastrous the government's budgetary strategy is, not only for the particular groups and constituencies that will be immediately and directly affected by it but indeed for the whole of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's approach in its budget strategy is built around three propositions: firstly, that there is a so&hyphen;called $8 billion black hole which reflects the Labor government's mismanagement; secondly, that this constitutes a crisis for Australian economic policy, the addressing of which has to be the highest priority; and, thirdly, any pain that is involved for particular groups in this budget strategy will be amply outweighed, amply compensated, by wider gains for the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Needless to say the opposition wholly rejects each one of those points. The points I will be making are these: as to the first, there is not a Beazley black hole but, rather, a Costello con&mdash;one simply designed to place the blame on Labor for the savings they are generating to cover the coalition's own irresponsibly underfunded election promises. And, secondly, it is designed to cover a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> passion for Thatcherite, small government ideology making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that, even if there were to be a $8 billion starting deficit, this nonetheless does not constitute a crisis for the Australian economy, nor any evidence of a failure of our economic management. Rather, it is a function of different and wholly legitimate policy choices, which I will spell out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point I will be making is that there will not be the gain to outweigh the pain in this respect, that economic responsibility demands a quite different policy approach&mdash;an approach that puts people first, that goes for growth now and which adopts a longer timetable for addressing the deficit reduction and other associated or related issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take each of those three points in turn. First of all, the so&hyphen;called Beazley black hole is not based on any calculation, any accounting, of what has happened in the past, and it is certainly not based on any calculation about blow-outs of expenditure. It is simply based on a Treasury and other officials' guess about what will happen in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $8 billion in fact is a puffed up, rounded out, exaggerated worst case figure. The headline starting point for next year&mdash;the figure you read about in the press the next day after each budget is brought down&mdash;is currently not $7.6 billion but $4.9 billion, and fully $2.3 billion of that is attributable to the coalition's own actions last year in blocking particular budget measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The so&hyphen;called underlying deficit, which does not bring into account asset sales and particular one&hyphen;off things like state debt repayments, is currently, on the government's officials' estimates, $7.6 billion. Even that is rather less than the $8 billion figure they constantly talk about, but it is certainly much less than the $3 billion it will reduce to over the next two years, again employing the government's officials' own estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, I guess, than those points is that there is every prospect that the growth predictions on which these particular projected deficits are calculated will change again by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="868"> August, changing in a way which reduces the so&hyphen;called starting deficit by several billion dollars. At the moment the Treasury, in making these calculations, has only half of the relevant data. When it made the forecasts that are in circulation at the moment, it had only one quarter of the relevant data for the current financial year. Years ago John Howard distinguished himself by saying that the forward estimates released well ahead of the budget were notoriously unreliable guides to the ultimate outcome. Dead right&mdash;they are. They were. They always have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professors John Neville and Fred Gruen and Mr Fred Argy in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today, 20 May, made the point with absolute clarity when they said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the figure of $8 billion is not itself a firm figure. It is a Treasury forecast assuming no policy changes and a rate of growth of the economy of 3.25 per cent . . . a small difference in the assumed rate of economic growth can make a large difference in the size of the projected deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the point can be made that the size of the possible deficit based on these predictions came as absolutely no surprise to Mr Costello or to the coalition. Access Economics predicted something like a $10 billion deficit based on different growth assumptions before Christmas. The now Treasurer, Mr Costello, was complaining publicly before Christmas about a huge hole opening up in Commonwealth finance. As Max Walsh said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  on 10 May:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there was the slightest surprise by John Howard or Peter Costello when they were told that the prospective deficit for 1996&hyphen;97 was $8 billion, then you would be concerned about their competence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That figure was in everybody's ballpark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why the demonising of Kim Beazley and his black hole has, for me at least, a lack of credibility.</PARA>
<PARA>The real reasons that the coalition is pursuing what can only be described as this Costello con is straightforward: it is to try in the first instance to put some blame on Labor for the savage spending cuts that are going to be necessary to finance some of the opposition's own irresponsibly underfunded election promises. The coalition promised $6.8 billion worth of new policy measures over the next <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> three years to be funded, supposedly, by $8.9 billion worth of savings measures. We, with the assistance of the Department of Finance, before the election, exposed the coalition as having itself a $4 billion hole in those savings measures. To take just one example, there was $360 million alone in the calculation of the savings that would be involved in the two&hyphen;year waiting time for social security for new migrants, a point confirmed by a recently leaked Department of Social Security document. Prime Minister Howard has carefully not ruled out utilising any of the $8 billion savings measures to pay for those pre&hyphen;election promises. The strategy is obvious. The strategy is: slash, burn, grab enough dollars to fund at least some of your pre-election promises, enough to remain credible, but blame the former Labor government for it by saying that it is all a necessary strategy brought on by our mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point is that the government is pursuing in all of this a small government ideological agenda which makes Margaret Thatcher look like Mary Poppins by comparison. The objective is absolutely transparent. Again, they want to off-load on Labor as much as possible of the blame for the pain that will be caused in the pursuit of that agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I want to make&mdash;and it is a very important one&mdash;is that there is no economic crisis associated with these figures, even if you accept them for the sake of this argument at their own face value. The headline deficit of $4.9 billion is no more than one per cent of our national income, of our GDP. Even the so&hyphen;called underlying deficit of $7.6 billion is only around 1&half; per cent of our national income. Neither of those figures, one or 1&half; per cent, is massive or even very large by international standards. A deficit of 1&half; per cent of national income would make us the equal third lowest of the major OECD countries as these figures were listed in the most recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Outlook</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compare those sorts of figures, those percentages, with what we faced coming into government in 1982&hyphen;83 and I think the point is made. The deficit that we confronted in those days' dollars of $9.6 billion was 4.9 per <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="869"> cent of national income. If you translate that into 1996&hyphen;97 figures, it is $24.5 billion. It was utterly unexpected, came out of the clear blue sky, and that was a budgetary crisis unquestionably that we had to confront and solve. This is trivial by comparison, even if you accept the puffed up, exaggerated, blown out numbers which I have already referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our structural deficit, when you wash out these figures for cyclical effects and look at the underlying balance of expenditure and revenue, is estimated by the OECD as the second lowest in that whole group of industrialised developed nations. Only Finland has a better looking balance sheet in this respect. Our deficit is around one&hyphen;quarter of the prevailing OECD average. If we had as a proportion of our national income the same average percentage deficit of the OECD countries as a whole, our starting headline deficit in 1996&hyphen;97 would not be $4.9 billion; it would be $15 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We just cannot make some of these comparisons too often. Our public expenditure is the second lowest after the United States in the whole of the OECD. Our proportion of taxation, our ratio of tax, to national income, GDP, is the second lowest in the OECD after Turkey. Everyone gets very passionate about New Zealand but, if you collected as high a proportion of tax as New Zealand does, this year Australians would be paying an extra $35 billion in taxation. We certainly would not be talking about budget deficits under those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, our public debt in Australia&mdash;another parrot cry endlessly in the economic debate&mdash;is the fourth lowest in the whole OECD after Japan, Norway and Finland. Let me answer the question, `How come the budget is not in better shape after 4&half; years of sustained growth?' This is a point that many commentators, not just on the government side but in the media, constantly make. Let me answer it by saying it is not a product of mismanagement in any sense; rather, it is a product of deliberate policy choice. In the first place, it is a product of our success in holding down inflation by a whole variety of strategies but, in the process, eliminating the usual fiscal drag revenue that is derived <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> naturally from inflation. In fact, rather than having disguised tax increases through effective bringing in of the tax scale at higher levels and generating more revenue without actually changing the legislation, rather than having those familiar disguised tax increases that have occurred so often in the past, we had a very explicit tax cut. That is where honest and effective government gets you, I suppose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point to make about this is that our progressive tariff reforms, that absolute centrepiece of our industry restructuring policy, have denied us ever increasing amounts of revenue each year. This year those cuts amount to a loss of some $6 billion in tariff revenue&mdash;deliberate policy strategy which has a major revenue reduction effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again&mdash;the third point&mdash;we chose to shield the states from the largest impact of the fiscal fallout of the recession by maintaining their general purpose payments in real terms at the same time that Commonwealth revenue was collapsing. We could have gone backwards and made life much tougher for the states. We chose not to do so. We are now bearing the budgetary consequences of that, but understand why it is that the budget deficit is higher than we would ideally like. It is a result of deliberate policy choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, we made and we have maintained a massive commitment to expenditure on education and training and job readiness programs. We faced in government in the 1980s new kinds of problems that were not around in the 1970s to confront Mr Howard last time he was in office and were not confronted then by governments anywhere&mdash;the problem basically of the information technology revolution which has meant the disappearance in particular of large swags of clerical jobs and the phenomenon of cultural change, especially women's entry into the work force in massive new numbers, reflecting their desire to make a positive contribution to the community and to their own personal satisfaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With women in the work force you now have much higher rates of people wanting jobs which, if we were translated back into the world of the early 1980s, would have very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="870"> different outcomes for our unemployment situation. If we had the same participation rate now as was the case in 1983, unemployment would be down around four per cent rather than the 8.9 per cent it is at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recognising the reality of these revolutionary technological changes and cultural changes that are involved in the different structure of the work force, as a government we went about placing massive new resources into education and training and skill development because we wanted to create a situation where our work force would have jobs in this brand new environment and would not be condemned to the status of long&hyphen;term unemployed. It was a deliberate policy choice, a very expensive policy choice and one that constitutes a large part of such deficit problem as there is in the budget figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short conceded recently that the ALP did not leave a lot of waste in its government programs when he said in his speech to the ACCI dinner that the former government was in the business of cutting programs which had, in fact, achieved their objectives efficiently and effectively. He said, as quoted in the press a few days ago:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will also need to prioritise between programs which are meeting a relevant objective effectively and efficiently. Such prioritisation is required both within and across portfolios.</PARA>
<PARA>That one statement alone gives the lie to the suggestion that we now have any product of Labor government mismanagement waste blow&hyphen;outs. The truth of the matter is we were a lean, taut government doing things that had to be done and should have been done in the interests of this country and they did have budgetary consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course it is true that, other things being equal&mdash;I have made this point on many occasions and I will continue making it&mdash;it is highly desirable that budgets be brought back into balance and, if possible, surplus to reduce government dissaving. We showed our credentials in that respect by being the only government since the war ever to deliver a surplus, and we in fact delivered four in a row in that respect&mdash;a task not managed by anyone else, certainly not the coalition.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Budget balance or budget surplus is not an objective to be manicly pursued at all costs, whatever the cost. Ross Gittins made the point very well indeed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 13 May when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Though it's true that the sooner we return the Budget to underlying surplus the more confident we can be of avoiding another blowout in the current account deficit, such a blowout is not imminent. There is no `crisis'.</PARA>
<PARA>Ross Gittins is saying, and so many other commentators have said, there is no crisis. That brings me to the third point: what is a responsible approach to economic management at this stage? What is a responsible budget strategy? There can be no doubt about the magnitude of the assault on the public sector and on public sector expenditure that is now being mounted by the coalition. I can document that assault, as evidence has already accumulated, but I will leave it to my colleagues to do so in the latter part of this debate. Let me concentrate for my purposes on the major theme of what is a responsible approach as distinct from the approach we are now seeing from the opposition. The general point I want to make about the assault is that it is not just a matter of their intense negative impact on particular groups or constituencies, on business, on the higher education industry, on a whole variety of people who are dependent on social welfare and on so many other areas. The point is that a matter of responsible economic policy, the approach that is being adopted, is utterly unnecessary and, in fact, wrong&hyphen;headed and utterly misguided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the economy needs now is not $8 billion of fiscal contraction but, rather, to consolidate the gains that we have had through almost five years of economic growth and to make a major new assault on the fundamental problem of the Australian economy at the moment, which is unemployment, and to do that by lifting the growth rate back to four per cent or more. The Australian economy is currently growing at an annual rate of around only three per cent. We are in fact one of the fastest growing economies in the OECD. By prevailing international standards in developed Western industrialised economies, three per cent looks pretty good. But we well know by now that three per cent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="871"> growth is simply not enough to cut unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To reduce unemployment further we need growth of at least 3&half; per cent and preferably four per cent. Private sector economists&mdash;it is not just us in the opposition but Westpac and Access Economics&mdash;are all saying that the government's cuts, if they go down this path with $4 billion this year and $4 billion next year, $8 billion worth of cuts, will mean at least half a per cent less growth in the economy this coming year and another half a per cent less the following year than would otherwise have been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of working to help the economy back up to the four per cent growth that we actually need, the budget cuts that are presently in train will actually work in exactly the opposite way. This cut in economic growth will, of course, translate directly into lower job growth. Less economic growth equals, obviously, less employment growth&mdash;and we can easily quantify it. The government's cuts, if you do take half a per cent off growth next year, will mean that over 40,000 jobs that would otherwise have been created with growth at the higher level will not be there. And over two years, the figure will be 80,000 jobs lost to this manic pursuit of a budget ideology that says `cut, cut, cut'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, there is very little scope for other economic forces&mdash;in particular, interest rates, exchange rate and confidence factors&mdash;to somehow come to the rescue and cushion the impact, modify the impact, of the government's planned cuts on the economy. It is true that the effect of a fiscal, a budgetary, contraction on economic growth could be cushioned in an environment where interest rates were falling and the exchange rate was depreciating. A reduction in interest rates could certainly stimulate private spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the government is planning its budget cuts in an environment where, because of the abandonment of the accord and because of the abandonment of wages policy, interest rates in everybody's assessment, from the Reserve Bank down, are more likely to rise than to fall in the immediately foreseeable future. A depreciation in the exchange rate, which might again in the normal course be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expected to follow from an interest rate cut, would make Australian goods more competitive on world markets, would be a boost to our exports. But in the real world at the moment, the exchange rate is being, in fact, driven up because of strong world commodity prices and demands for the commodities that we produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of fiscal contraction, I acknowledge again, might also be cushioned if somehow the cuts were to translate, as some people have predicted they will, into a massive rise in consumer and business confidence&mdash;this intangible lift to animal spirits that is supposed to occur when rough and tough budgetary, highly disciplined decision making of this kind is made. But the point is that on all the available information we have, the surveys that have been done, the hard evidence is that business and consumer confidence are already high, so that any further boost that would be achievable would have a marginal impact on the economy at best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before we left office, statistics from the ABS, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, showed that business was planning to increase its investment spending by as much as 27 per cent over the next financial year. With business investment expectations already so obviously buoyant, as they unquestionably have been, there simply is not scope for an additional increase in private investment of the kind of magnitude that would be sufficient to soften the blow of the proposed budget cuts on the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So here we have a government which is planning massive cuts in an environment where confidence is already high, where interest rates are more likely to rise than to fall and where the exchange rate is set to remain very strong. In this environment, massive budget cuts can have no economic impact other than to dampen economic growth. The only other possible justification for further budget cuts is that Australia needs more national savings, and the government has to responsibly contribute to this task by reducing the deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already said that the opposition agrees that Australia needs more national <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="872"> saving. But the government's totally unbalanced approach to economic management is not the way to go about successfully boosting national saving. Leaving to one side superannuation policy and all the rest of the longer term measures that we put in place, the best way to get more national saving is very simply to have a strongly growing economy. A strongly growing economy means that people have the extra income to build up their private saving. More economic growth means that more people have jobs which means less government spending on unemployment benefits. That means more tax revenue, less expenditure and more public saving. There is a very strong and a very clear relationship between unemployment and national saving. As unemployment falls, national saving rises. The best way to get national saving up is to get unemployment down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This point, again, has been very well made by those excellent, well&hyphen;regarded economists Fred Gruen, John Nevile and Fred Argy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in a letter this morning when they said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is neither necessary nor desirable to seek to reduce discretionary spending by $8 billion over the next two years simply because the economy is forecast to grow more slowly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>more slowly than was assumed in the 1995-96 budget, that is. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the economy is indeed slowing down, such a policy may well slow it down further and increase unemployment in the short term, while helping neither the fiscal deficit nor the national saving rate.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me conclude on this note. The crucial thing in economic policy is not to confuse means and ends. The first priority for economic policy should always be people. The objective of economic policy and of economic management of the economy is to improve people's living standards through providing sustainable full employment and rising incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everything else&mdash;whether it is controlling inflation, reducing the current account deficit, bringing budgets back into balance or surplus, reducing public debt, reducing foreign debt or increasing savings&mdash;are second and third order objectives by comparison. They are means to the achievement of the primary <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> objective of improving people's living standards. There are times&mdash;there are real crisis times&mdash;when absolute priority attention has to be devoted to bringing inflation under control or hauling absolutely unacceptable levels of current account deficit back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not the situation of the Australian economy at the moment in the view of any serious-minded economic commentator. I have to say that it is not the view of any of the senior chief executives, senior managers or senior analysts in the banks and the financial institutions, the corporate leaders of this nation whom I have been talking to over the last few weeks. Inflation is comfortably within the average two to three per cent underlying rate of inflation range that everyone agrees is desirable to target for and to achieve. The current account deficit has been brought down from six per cent of GDP to 4&half; per cent of GDP. It is being comfortably serviced at present at foreseeable export levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is simply not necessary at the moment, if it is ever necessary, to mount some kind of Vietnam style crusade to destroy the economy supposedly in order to save it. It is possible, while being absolutely economically responsible, to choose a very different path in the government's management of the economy and its budgetary strategy over the weeks and months ahead. It is possible to choose a quite different path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say the priority for economic decision makers in Australia today should be to resume growth and to make a new assault on unemployment. That is what the priority task should be. You do not achieve that priority task by moving down this particular slash and burn route. You do not abandon the aspiration of getting the budget back to surplus but you spread the task out over longer time periods so you do not have those adverse impacts on growth in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that that is what the priority task should be about&mdash;that is, getting growth back up to four per cent and generating the capacity as a result to make a significant impact on unemployment, which is unquestionably the greatest human problem as well as the greatest economic problem in Australia at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="873"> moment. That is not what this budget is going to be about. It will be to the everlasting shame of this  government that it has so quickly and so conspicuously and so mindlessly failed to meet, in these ways, the real needs of the Australian economy and the real needs of the Australian people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I rise in this House to speak for the first time, I am mindful of the challenge that lies ahead in delivering responsive government to the people of Canning. I first contested Canning, which is situated in Perth's south-east corridor, way back in 1984. I stood for this electorate in five successive elections before taking my place in this House today. The fact that I was on the campaign trail for so long led many people to assume they could come to me with their problems and concerns and have them resolved. Indeed, some members of the Liberal Party used to refer to me as the longest serving federal member without a seat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If any electorate in Western Australia demonstrates how people have turned away from the Labor Party over the last 13 years it is Canning. Every year, every election, more and more people felt their expectations were not being met. The 1996 election saw Labor's traditional supporters desert them as never before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put on the record my thanks to our Prime Minister, John Howard, and the many senators and members who campaigned so vigorously on my behalf. A special thank you must also go to Senator Ian Campbell and his staff, whose advice and assistance were always readily available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It truly is a most humbling experience to be elected to represent the people of Canning. Because I have fought so long and so tenaciously to win the honour of representing the people who live in my electorate, I have no intention of wasting the marvellous opportunity they have so generously bestowed upon <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> me. I pledge to serve them with enthusiasm, compassion and fortitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, let me cast your mind back to 1984 when I first started campaigning: the Berlin Wall still separated a nation; the USSR was a major world power; Saddam Hussein enjoyed the support and the claim of the West in his fight against Iran; and here in Australia there was only one conservative state government. But thankfully times have changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor came to power in 1993 Australians had no idea of the tough years ahead. We suffered through the infamous recession we had to have. Our foreign debt skyrocketed and interest rates soared. Far too many ordinary Australians sank deeper into the mire of unemployment. This had a devastating effect, causing family breakups, associated social problems and an escalation in the level of crime. By 1996 the string of broken Labor promises ensured that the chasm between the haves and have&hyphen;nots had widened dramatically. What a great legacy from a so&hyphen;called egalitarian government! Labor's mismanagement has left its impact on all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I witnessed hard&hyphen;working people struggle to make ends meet and families disintegrate. Small business owners fell into ruin as a result of unfair high taxes and bureaucratic red tape. All of this was introduced by a government that had no inkling of, and probably less interest in, the sacrifices people had to make just to survive, let alone create wealth for this country. In my local area I have a reputation for hanging in there for the good fight, for being tenacious, for being knocked down in one round and getting up to fight another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party offered a better alternative to the 13 years of Labor hardship inflicted on all Australians. They offered hope and the restoration of quality of life for all of us. It was this belief that inspired me to continue to battle for the right to represent the people of Canning in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like many Australians, I am the child of immigrants. In 1954 my parents chose to travel halfway around the world from their native Germany. They left behind family and friends to begin a life in a country which to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="874"> them was very alien&mdash;a vast, harsh land, but safe and politically stable compared to the ruins of postwar Germany.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My parents, Maya and Henry Heppekausen, provided me with a stable, loving upbringing which inspired my staunch moral and social beliefs. They encouraged me to form my own opinions early in life, to participate in community activities and to strive towards upholding the rights of the individual and the rule of law. I am thankful for those values instilled in me and I hope they will serve me well when making decisions as the people's representative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My father often remarks on the wonderful opportunities open to all Australians. I do not take this magnificent country for granted. Indeed, I am proud my parents chose to make Australia our home and become citizens of this nation. We found that if one was prepared to work hard and to save, one's toils could be rewarded with unlimited opportunities and a better future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, many of those attitudes have disappeared. Much of our pioneer spirit has vanished. That capacity for effort and the determination which shaped the ethos that helped build this great country have largely faded under a Labor administration. Today a significant segment of our community scream in demand for their rights. They have been fed the language of rights without being encouraged to accept the responsibility that earns these rights. We have prisoners' rights, children's rights, illegal immigrant rights and dozens more. All this talk about rights, yet few people are willing to admit to their responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As citizens of this country, we all have responsibilities to ensure that Australia is as good a country to live in as we can make it. We have responsibilities to our families, our friends, our neighbours, our employers/employees and to the community in general. Many of those who loudly demand their rights shirk their responsibilities. Yet, if we are to turn Australia around, we should all act responsibly. The emphasis should not be on what this country owes to the individual <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but what each individual owes to this great country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was my late father&hyphen;in&hyphen;law, Fred Johnston, who introduced me to the tenets of Liberalism. Fred was a foundation member of the modern Liberal Party and a great friend of Sir Robert Menzies. He was a pioneer of Western Australia's meat industry and a passionate believer in the principles of free enterprise. He postulated that those who worked hard were entitled to just rewards. Fred was an inspiration to many people. He was a man of conscience and brilliant ideas who dedicated himself to working for the betterment of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first met Fred about 30 years ago, many Liberals believed that a woman's role was to work behind the scenes and make the tea, despite the fact that the first wave of female politicians came from the conservative ranks. How delighted Fred would be to see the number of `tea ladies' on the government side of the House today, especially those elected to the key seats that helped John Howard form his government! And would you believe, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, that all of this was achieved without Labor's quota for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to tell you a little about the electorate that I represent. It is typically Australian in its make&hyphen;up. Canning extends from the south&hyphen;east metropolitan areas of Perth to adjoining rural areas. Named after Alfred Canning&mdash;a surveyor who pioneered the great stock routes and rabbit proof fencing&mdash;it was first proclaimed in 1948 and has an area of more than 1,200 square kilometres. Although many people think of Canning as being a very ordinary sort of place, some of the best views of Perth can be seen from the hills of our area. These hills, which form part of the Darling escarpment,  cradle three of Perth's major dams and supply Perth residents with much of their water. At the other end of the electorate, in Canning Vale, we have the home of the famous Swan Brewery and Western Australia's largest produce markets. We also have some very interesting vineyards, but I doubt whether many members have had their pallets tantalised by these fascinating vintages. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="875">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people assume my electorate also takes its name from the Canning River, which feeds into the beautiful Swan. As a child, I played on the banks of the Canning River. Back then you could swim and fish to your heart's content. But, sadly, this is another change that has taken place. The Canning River is now polluted and choked with algal bloom. Whilst not quite dead, the river is very dormant. John Howard's government has promised $1 billion to help rehabilitate environmental problem areas like the Canning River. Central to this policy is the partial sale of Telstra, but it would appear that some of those in the other place are hell&hyphen;bent on opposing this proposed sale. I can only conclude from this that they do not share the government's commitment to a cleaner, greener Australia. However, I want to remind them that it is precisely this which the coalition was elected to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Canning is very representative of hardworking middle Australia. The light industrial areas of Maddington, Kelmscott and Armadale consist mainly of small business which provide jobs for many of my constituents. Large retailers such as Coles&hyphen;Myer and Foodland Associated Ltd have their state head offices in Canning Vale. In contrast to this, the southernmost aspect of the electorate is rural, scattered with tourist attractions, orchards, dairy and emu farms, horse studs and timber mills. While this may paint a happy picture of stable employment, Canning, like much of Australia, has suffered from Labor's legacy of high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In January 1996 I commissioned a small business survey in Canning. The overwhelming response from employers was total loss of confidence in the future of their business in terms of profit and job growth. Ninety&hyphen;two per cent of respondents rated the former Labor government's performance as poor or very poor. Only seven per cent gave Labor an average rating, while just one per cent said that it was doing a good job. However, since the March election, I have been in regular contact with many employers. I sense a new hope. Small business owners particularly have welcomed this government's policies, which will provide opportunities for growth, jobs <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and wealth creation. They are firmly convinced that these policies, when implemented, will lead to improved living standards for the people of Canning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Four local government councils, with a combined population of about 140,000, stretch across my electorate. Continuous expansion of both residential and commercial areas within these geographic regions means that adequate long-term planning for roads and bridges is extremely necessary. I have already briefed the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) on the urgency of implementing an integrated road system which will require substantial federal funding in conjunction with state and local government authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Canning is such a large metropolitan electorate, I have formulated plans for a mobile office. This will allow me to visit schools, shopping centres and retirement homes, making it easier for me to meet with people. Apart from being able to deal with their concerns on the spot, my intention is to encourage people to once again have faith in their government and its process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last decade, the public's cynicism towards the political process has escalated to an unprecedented level. In many instances, the people view the performance of their elected representatives with contempt. I applaud the Prime Minister's commitment to restore respect for our national parliament in the true spirit of the Westminster system. We have in our hands a great trust, which I feel sure we in this House can all fulfil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similar to other parts of Australia, Canning has an ageing population. It has been estimated that, by the year 2010, 22 per cent of Australians will be aged 60 years or over. We must, if we are to remain a humane and caring society, ensure that the more mature members of our community are treated with respect, honour and, above all, dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a nurse, successful small business operator, local government councillor and service coordinator for the aged, I have sadly on some occasions witnessed the indifferent manner in which we treat many of our elderly citizens, especially those suffering from dementia. This is an area of our health care <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="876"> system where the implementation of an improved means of palliative care is still in its infancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too often, people so afflicted are left to lead an existence of drug&hyphen;induced stupor. As a result of this, they experience very little stimulation, which may become a contributing factor to the gradual loss of their faculties. However, their quality of life can be improved. This government's commitment, therefore, to focus more directly on the special care needs of the elderly is most timely and indeed most welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Appropriate facilities for the elderly in my electorate are acutely scarce. Specifically, I have identified the desperate need for more nursing home beds as well as alternative accommodation. As this problem has been allowed to drift for a long time, there is an urgency to act now. By bringing together representatives from community organisations, state and federal governments, I hope to establish a meaningful dialogue so as to ensure that these needs are met in the best possible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern though is not just for those aged people who suffer illness. Many older folk remain relatively fit and mentally astute. But lately there seems to be the general notion that, once a person reaches the age of 65, their usefulness somehow evaporates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Age brings wisdom, yet Labor failed to tap into this rich and valuable resource. The previous government rarely listened to our elderly. Indeed, they dismissed their views in favour of those of the social psycho engineers whose sometimes crackpot theories have done much to disintegrate the social fabric of our society. This government will recognise the talent of older Australians. It will broaden the scope in which they can continue to contribute to a range of economic and community activities. It will also ensure that all elderly citizens are given a fairer deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern that causes me great distress is the observation of just how fragile families have become. Family life should be the cornerstone of our community. All too often without the support of a stable family environment, our youth run the risk of becoming alienated. They need role models, both at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> home and in the community, whom they can respect and look up to. Above all, they need a sense of security and values and the opportunity to succeed, which they in turn can pass on to their children. I say this because I firmly believe Australia's best asset is its youth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as providing adequate social services to families, we have inherited the ridiculous situation in which low income married couples with children are allowed to be financially worse off than others simply because they choose to remain together in a cohesive family unit. Financial pressures on families over the last decade have often been the first trigger towards family breakdowns. I intend to take an active role in this government to bring about a change for the better in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me briefly touch on a subject which, as a student of politics, I have a great interest in&mdash;that is, the question of voluntary versus compulsory voting. I do not resile from the fact that I favour voluntary voting. Pedantic opponents of voluntary voting may argue that, in Australia under the present system, people are not compelled to vote&mdash;they merely have to go to a polling booth and have their names crossed off. However, it is my opinion that compulsory voting actually devalues a citizen's right. By making the failure to vote a punishable offence, we have lowered citizens' appreciation of the importance of their choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Voluntary voting, on the other hand, gives citizens cause to reflect on the power contained within their vote. I totally reject the cynical and pessimistic view that large numbers of Australians will be too apathetic to vote. Indeed, I believe we have nothing to fear in discussing this important principle in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before concluding, I want to thank the hundreds of people who offered their time and service to ensure Canning would have a Liberal representative. Volunteers came from all walks of life&mdash;the young and old, the disabled, the unemployed, Liberals and disillusioned Labor supporters. It is impossible to mention them all, but I especially acknowledge those six dedicated ladies who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="877"> worked long hours for many months in the most trying conditions in the hottest campaign office one can ever imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable members would know, one does not arrive at this House without the support of one's family. My two sons, Allistair and Adrian, never complained when they were asked to hand out yet another how to vote card over so many years. My husband, Ian, whose understanding, encouragement and belief in my commitment never wavered, is my best friend, critic and confidant. His objective analysis of the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day situation during the long campaign periods was invaluable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final words are to the electors of Canning whose desire to have a Liberal government allows me to be here today. I see my new role as the servant of all the people of Canning. I hope that we on this side of the House will have the courage to stick to our policies and to implement them with sensitivity and compassion. The Howard government has given people new hope. I am confident that, by working together with the people, the future for all of us will be brighter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence this evening by doing something that is a bit unusual for a member of the opposition, that is, giving the government a couple of bouquets. As a new member of the parliament but someone who has had quite a lot of experience in the Victorian parliament, compared with Victorian Premier Kennett, I find the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) comes across as a statesman and a gentleman. Some people might think I have just damned the Prime Minister with faint praise, but I make that observation in all seriousness concerning the conduct of the parliament and, for example, the cut in the size of the ministry from 30 to 28, which is to be compared with the Victorian Premier's view of the Victorian government as a source of reward for his friends and cronies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, Premier Kennett had the Victorian ministry expanded from 18 to 22, appointed parliamentary secretaries with allowances in the order of $7,000 a year and doubled the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allowances for committee chairmen, with the government deciding that it would have all the committee chairs in the Victorian parliament. That was against the custom and practice in the Victorian parliament, where committee chairs had previously been shared around. Compared with that, I have to acknowledge that the Prime Minister at least shows a shred of integrity in reducing the size of his own ministry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second bouquet relates to the government's response to the tragedy at Port Arthur. If there is one thing which this community has to do and one thing which we as legislators and politicians have to do, it is to provide an appropriate response to that appalling disaster which befell people in Port Arthur just a few weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the Prime Minister has shown genuine leadership and his response has my total support. Equally, I believe that the response of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has been spot on. It also has my unqualified support. I am pleased that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is here this evening because he has had a substantial involvement in this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also indicate to the House that the response of the media has been one of great leadership in putting these issues before the public and before us as parliamentarians. I say this subject to the qualification that, in the last week or so, it is my view that the media have provided undue coverage to the representatives of that most unrepresentative of groups, the gun lobby. When you look at opinion polls and observe that more than 90 per cent of Australians support the Prime Minister's package, it seems to me that they really are receiving undue coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of example, one of the Sydney newspapers surveyed all of us as members of parliament and asked for our views on three questions: do we support a national system of gun laws; do we support the registration of all firearms; and do we support a ban on automatic and semi&hyphen;automatic weapons? I, and virtually every other member of this House who responded, indicated yes to all three questions. Our answers were printed in that particular newspaper.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="878">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I recall, there was only one member who responded to that questionnaire to the effect that he did not support the registration of all firearms and that he did not support a ban on automatic and semi&hyphen;automatic weapons. If the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) does not have the courage&mdash;does not have the guts&mdash;to stand up to the gun lobby, that is his problem. But it does not, in my view, entitle him to undue media coverage when the fact is that the overwhelming majority of members of parliament support&mdash;as I do&mdash;national registration of firearms and support a ban on automatic and semi&hyphen;automatic weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we as a parliament have to have something that we can say to the victims of the Port Arthur massacre, something that we can say to Walter Mikac, whose wife and two children were killed in that event&mdash;his daughter, having seen her mother and her sister killed, hiding behind a tree and then being killed herself. We have to have something that we can say to him about our willingness to address these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to have something that we can say to people who now live in fear in aspects of their daily lives which are both unavoidable and appropriate. For example, as a parent I send my daughter to Moonee Ponds West Primary School. I feel that I and every other parent who sends a child to primary school ought not to have to worry about whether or not there could be a repeat of the events of Dunblane in Scotland, where a whole class of young boys and girls&mdash;some 16 children&mdash;were killed by a single assailant armed with a semi-automatic weapon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we go to work we should not have to worry about whether we could become victims in our own workplace, as workers at Australia Post became in 1987 in the massacre at Queen Street in Melbourne. At that time I was an employee of Australia Post and I remember very well and very vividly the shock and dismay that was felt by people in Australia Post after that tragic event. When we leave work or when we go to work we should not feel that we, too, could become victims in the way that people going home from work became the victims of the Hoddle <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Street killer, Julian Knight, who was armed with military training and with military weapons&mdash;or, indeed, the man who was going to work in my electorate in Fawkner a year and a half ago and who was killed with a semi-automatic weapon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not have to feel that, when we go shopping, we might have the same situation that occurred in the Strathfield Plaza shopping centre, where people were killed by Wade Frankum. Finally, we should not have to feel that, when we go on holidays to some of Australia's most picturesque and attractive landscapes, as Port Arthur is, or to other places, we might become the victims of a mass killer, as occurred just a few weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to have something to say to people who are concerned about these things. We have to get together as a community, as a national parliament and as state parliaments to address these issues in the way that the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, with the full support and cooperation of the opposition, have been doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A supply bill includes within it supply for the parliament, including supply for the Senate. On that note, I want to congratulate the Senate on the steps that it has taken to hold an inquiry into the tender process surrounding the casino in Victoria. There are a lot of questions that need to be answered arising out of such an inquiry&mdash;questions to which Victorians wish to know the answers and are entitled to know the answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask this House: how is it that, when ITT Sheraton put together a bid which was $80-odd million in excess of the bid put forward by Hudson Conway, or the Crown consortium, ITT Sheraton was not the successful tenderer? What in fact happened was that the tender was put out again for further bids and the Crown bid mysteriously rose by $80-plus million to equal the ITT Sheraton bid. Then the Crown consortium was able to win the bid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How is it that the Treasurer of Victoria, Mr Stockdale, was able to ask for and receive details of those bids? How is it that Ron Walker and the Premier, Jeff Kennett, could be seen sitting on the dock of the bay&mdash;Port Phillip Bay&mdash;when they had been warned <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="879"> against contact, discussing presumably the weather during this bidding process? How is it that after the casino contract was awarded to Crown the Victorian government made so many decisions which advantaged the casino in so many ways that surely ITT Sheraton would have been prepared to up their bid very substantially had they known that these things were going to occur? These are appropriate subjects for a Senate casino inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also urge that inquiry to investigate the most recent revelations concerning the Premier's and Felicity Kennett's purchase of some 50,000 shares in the Guangdong Corporation through the intercession of Mr Bruce Mathieson. What many members of parliament may not be aware of is that, long prior to revelations by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today Tonight</EMPHASIS> a week ago, people were coming to me and to other members of the opposition screaming about the preferential treatment being given to Bruce Mathieson. He had bought up hotels which had been unable to get poker machine licences. They had applied for licences but had not been given them, and when the hotels were sold to Bruce Mathieson he was able to jump the queue and get poker machine licences. Those are matters which the Senate casino inquiry ought to investigate also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at a supply bill provides an opportunity to study what situation our economy is in. These days the most dominant feature of our economy is the way in which it has become so internationalised through transport and communication advances. Companies are simply able to relocate their businesses from Australia to other parts of the world at the drop of a hat. That imposes a tremendous discipline on Australians who wish to maintain our standards of living. It certainly poses challenges to the labour movement, to the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">History shows that we had a situation a century ago and in previous centuries associated with the industrial revolution where employers were able to effectively pit worker against worker, pay very low wages and have very poor working conditions as a result. Trade unions were able to band workers together and gradually and progressively <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> improve living standards and working conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the internationalisation of our economy and the way in which companies can simply relocate overseas at the drop of a hat certainly challenge that. It is important, in my view, that we look at lifting the standards of other countries because, if we are unable to do that, we will end up finding our own standards progressively diminished. We need in this regard a social clause in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I regard that as a very important thing which this parliament ought to be pursuing in order to protect the living standards and the working conditions of working Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this country we have had during the past decade the accord, which has been fundamental to securing Australia's international competitiveness, to securing lower industrial disputation and to securing the wellbeing of ordinary workers and protecting their wages, while at the same time enabling reforms in the area of superannuation, employment growth, Medicare, child care and others to be pursued. The accord has been of immense benefit to workers, to employers and to the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result principally of the accord, Australia has been handed over to the incoming coalition government in very good shape. I think the correct analogy is with that couple visiting Australia at the moment&mdash;the magician David Copperfield and the international supermodel Claudia Schiffer. I think that our economy is in as good a shape as Claudia Schiffer. Unemployment came down from 10 per cent in 1983 to some 8.5 per cent when it was handed over to the coalition. All the while the participation rate rose from 60.4 per cent in March 1983 to 63.4 per cent in March 1996. Inflation has come down from 11.4 per cent in March 1983 to some 3.7 per cent in March this year, so inflation has been reduced by two-thirds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prime interest rates have been reduced from 14.5 per cent in August 1983 to 10.75 per cent in August 1995&mdash;reduced by a quarter. In relation to industrial disputes, in January 1983 the number of working days lost was 105,000, whereas in January of this year the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="880"> figure was 20,000. So we have seen industrial disputes reduced by in the order of 80 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regarding the budget deficit, we inherited a budget deficit of $9.6 billion&mdash;some 4.9 per cent of GDP&mdash;compared with the figure of $4.9 billion which is used by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) at the moment and which represents less than one per cent of GDP. Rarely in politics does an incoming government inherit an economy in such good shape. But the government refuses to recognise this. They want to resort to the magic of Claudia's partner, David Copperfield. So the chief sorcerer&mdash;the Treasurer&mdash;says that, if you repeat the magic words `black hole' often enough, one of those black holes is going to appear. What he needs to understand is that, if you repeat the magic words three times and no black hole shows, that is a trick that you ought to abandon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other ministers who fancy themselves as magicians as well. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, wants to perform that old trick of trying to saw a woman in half but, instead, is applying it to the university sector. Senator Vanstone believes that you can cut funding by 12 per cent and still have a university sector catering for the same number of students. She wants to see the HECS repayments for students rise by the order of 30 per cent. In my view, if you want to perform that particular magic routine you will end up looking not so much a magician as a clown. We have a Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism who did not pull a rabbit out of his hat a few weeks ago. What Mr Moore pulled out of his hat was a new tax. So we have a number of ministers who think they are David Copperfield.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In addition, we have a government which fundamentally is suffering from anorexia. It thinks that the economy is overweight, when in fact it is very nicely proportioned and, certainly, surgery is no cure. The government is behaving like a troubled adolescent, ashamed of the nation's economy. It cannot stomach the sight of itself in the mirror. The govern ment wants us to believe that the economy is in terrible shape and that the beautiful curves are in fact hideous distortions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's prescription for the Australian economy is a starvation diet. Regrettably, as we all understand, anorexia is in fact a very dangerous condition. I would urge the government&mdash;</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(8.19 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 September 1943, Dame Enid Lyons stood in this House and made history. In her first speech here she acknowledged the turning point that was marked by her arrival. Fifty&hyphen;three years later, in the 38th Parliament, times have certainly changed. There has been much attention paid since the election to the fact that we now have 23 women members in this House. While it is aesthetically pleasing to look around the House and see the different colours scattered here, the scattering represents meagre progress, as 53 years on there are still only 23 out of 148 of us here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is indeed a thrill to stand here in this House for the first time and speak as Dame Enid did 53 years ago. As I was putting these words together, I rang the Parliamentary Library to see if they could suggest a term as the male equivalent to `maiden', which is associated with qualities like youth and virtue and the state of being single. I should not be surprised, therefore, that there is no male equivalent. In the absence of a suitable word, I have decided to refer to this as my first speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 84,777 electors of Kingston have indeed bestowed upon me an enormous honour. My constituents can be assured that, together with their dependants, they have my total commitment as the vehicle for the expression of their political rights in this place. I look forward to fulfilling this commitment for as many years as I enjoy their confidence to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is customary in one's first speech in this House to thank those who helped you to get here. I must therefore start with the two people who perhaps pay the highest price for the attainment of my political goals&mdash;my daughters, Lauren and Jenna, who, quite surprisingly, are here tonight. Being their mother is and always will be my most important and most cherished role. I also thank my parents, Barbara and Bill Jeanes. As I move around my electorate meeting families in crisis&mdash;families where children suffer in the most horrendous ways&mdash;I am constantly reminded of the fortuitous start that I had in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> life through the plain good luck of turning up in the nursery bearing the name tag `Jeanes'. And, of course, I must thank my long&hyphen;suffering partner of 20 years, my husband, Bruce, who is also here tonight in the gallery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two&hyphen;party preferred swing in Kingston was 3.6 per cent. An analysis of the swings across the marginal seats in South Australia shows that visibility played a significant part in the final outcomes. Of particular note is our preoccupation with election posters. According, therefore, to my husband, the work that I put in over the 12 months leading up to the election was responsible for only half my swing. The other half, according to Bruce, was won by him, my dad, Don Phillips and their poster operations team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not see Bruce very much during the campaign as he was very busy every night repairing, replacing and just putting up over 1,000 of my posters. After the election, he found that he could no longer escape at night. He had to come home and spend time with me, causing him considerable adjustment problems! I must also pay tribute to the hard work of my committee headed by my dear friend Trevor, whose ongoing humour, advice and support is treasured. Our team included people like Rod Callagher and Joan Turner, who continued to strive to help me get here simply because they believed that this country desperately needed a Liberal government at this the federal level to restore responsible economic management and social cohesion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the hard work put in by so many, it could be easy to miss the meaning of an election victory and subsequent arrival in this place. It is an awesome responsibility, and indeed a great privilege, to represent the political rights of others. I think that the importance of what has happened to me, and the immense responsibility that I now have, is finally sinking in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the night of the election, I do not think I really realised that I had won. When my opponent rang at about 9 o'clock to concede defeat, all I could think of was to say, `Are you sure?' This did not seem to please him much. He sent me a warning on national television that he would leave a message for me in my office. And what a message he left! <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="882"> As my staff and I entered the office for the first time, no-one took much notice of a report that was left in the front bookcase about the viral diseases in rodents and ruminants. Nor did anyone bother to look at the chapters about the effect of these diseases on humans. It was not until we went into the kitchen that the meaning of the message began to be understood. There were indeed many little messages left in the kitchen drawers and the cupboards. The small, brown creatures that left the messages had my staff and I squealing with delight&mdash;not terror of course&mdash;as we stood on our desk tops and desperately dialled the department for the pest controller.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the age of about 12, I have been fascinated with politics. It has in fact taken me 26 years to get here. My appetite was whetted when Steele Hall, the then Premier of South Australia, wanted to make the electoral system fair to ensure that the votes of all eligible people were of equal worth. As a 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;old, I was struck by the inherent justness of this reform and I became a devotee of Steele and the Liberal side of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pay tribute to Steele for his active participation as our campaign manager in the Kingston campaign. His support and counsel I have truly valued. I would also like to pay tribute to Senator Robert Hill for giving me my first break in this business and for his continuing friendship and support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank Senator Vanstone and the member for Sturt, Christopher Pyne, and his FEC for their contributions and support to my campaign. Perhaps the greatest contributor to my successful arrival in this place is my dear friend and colleague the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). I have had the benefit of an apprenticeship to my party's most outstanding marginal seat campaigner. Chris, I have learnt from your successes and I have had the benefit of learning from your mistakes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more importantly, our families will no doubt enjoy a lifelong friendship. I am thrilled that Alex is here tonight with Bruce and the rest of my family in the gallery. The one achievement of yours, however, that I have absolutely no intention of repeating is to ever <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> win by 14 votes. I well remember the tension of those 2&half; weeks after the 1990 election when no&hyphen;one knew whether or not we had won the seat of Hawker&mdash;but win it we did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could not let this opportunity pass without mentioning the departure from the other place across the hall of one of its most worthy senators. Senator Baden Teague's term expires at the end of June. I am truly saddened that I will not have the benefit of his company or counsel as I embark upon my work here. Baden is one of nature's true gentlemen and a rare specimen of uncompromising honesty and decency in our business. I wish Baden and Kathy a happy and constructive life after politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every new member who arrives in this place no doubt has the intention of changing the world, to make it the way they think it should be&mdash;and I am no different, in that respect, from any other new member. There are, however, two problems that will be encountered by us all as we attempt to change our worlds. The first is that events in this life and in public life generally seem to have an inertia of their own. To change the direction is much harder than any of us ever imagined. There is always an interest group waiting in the wings to jump in and accost any member who wants to take something away from them or disturb their patch. They will fight to the end to defend their ground. Changing the status quo is a lot harder than one could ever imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second problem is that we do not always acknowledge that the way we want the world to be is not necessarily the way others want the world to be. This is perhaps the biggest hurdle of all. At university I studied political philosophy and had the good fortune to be a student of Professor Bill Brugger. Bill taught me that you must always search for the truth. The problem with this, as he also taught me, is that everyone's truth is different. So I am mindful of the fact that things as I see them are not necessarily as others see them. My deduction, therefore, is of course that others are not always right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am most fortunate to enjoy Bill's ongoing counsel. He, along with my friend that urban guerilla, Cherie Hoyle, bears the responsibility <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="883"> for keeping my conscience and my soul in a state of good health. So I come to the job and to the decisions I must make in the job with a commitment to search for all the relevant factors. But even in the event that you have all the necessary information available to you, you still have to make judgments based on more than just a balancing act. Judgments have to be based upon an ethical foundation and must contribute to the advancement of human society. My goal in this place is to contribute to the advancement of human society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No political philosopher throughout history has ever got it entirely right. Philosophers build their life's work based on a depiction of human nature, and the fundamental problem is that an all&hyphen;encompassing picture of human nature is yet to be accurately constructed. Obviously, all those philosophers held up as having achieved greatness had something useful to contribute. Those who I believe have provided the most use are those who have perhaps not adhered to a rigid ideological position, those who have not sought ideological consistency for the sake of ideological consistency but who have perhaps been more pragmatic, more willing to look outside their own experiences for answers. Those who search for the whole truth and who have accommodated a range of human characteristics as they go about their work have the most to offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At university, the philosophy of liberalism captured my imagination, not the atomistic liberalism expressed by those whose rhetoric emphasises terms like `individual rights', but the strand that emerged through the work of John Stuart Mill and later built on by the likes of my personal favourite, Leonard Trelawney Hobhouse. Together with their peers, they recognised the interdependence of humans and the proper role of government in supporting the conditions for positive interdependence. They extended the concept of individual rights and freedoms to recognise this interdependence and the rightful role of a democratic government in ensuring the rights and freedoms of all&mdash;not just the wealthy, the privileged and the powerful.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Michael Walzer, a contemporary writer, provides the most practical guidelines to policy developers in the liberal vein if their aim is to promote justice throughout all society. Walzer examines the various social and cultural goods that Western societies value and argues that one's success in one sphere should not bar one's access to the goods in another sphere. These are the great liberals who all provide me with the inspiration I need as I pursue my goal of contributing to the advancement of society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this time in our nation's development there are three key policy areas that I believe need to be addressed and my aim is to contribute to advancement in these areas as a member of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, my experiences over the past 18 months as both a candidate and now as a member have, at times, shocked me. I have met a much larger number of children and families than I would have ever thought existed who have been affected by the most horrendous incidences of child abuse, and in particular child sexual abuse. I do not understand where we have gone wrong as a society to produce so many people who sexually, physically and emotionally abuse children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My government has initiated a tough regime of national gun control measures in response to what can only be described as one of Australia's greatest tragedies, and I applaud the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for his decisive and responsible action. But restricting access to guns is not the only measure necessary to protect the Australian people against some of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to find out why people get to the stage where they do things like this. What goes wrong in the development of people where they depart so far from reality and from basic rules of behaviour? It seems that these things can begin to go wrong very early in the lives of children. Too many families seem to have lost the skills that are necessary to produce healthy, well&hyphen;adjusted adults, and this is undeniably our nation's greatest shame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who bury their heads in the sand and deny the fundamental right of children to a healthy family environment by denying government its rightful role to ensure their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="884"> protection must share the responsibility for the shame. It is for this reason that I have come to believe that we need to look at establishing something like a commissioner for children, perhaps based in the Human Rights Commission, with extensive powers to protect and foster the rights of Australia's children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our children deserve an advocate who will conduct ongoing research into the extent to which their rights are not upheld and their needs not met, to provide advice to governments on the basis of this research and to hold governments accountable for their actions to remedy problem areas. The ills of our society cannot be cured until we address this fundamental problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is partly for the reasons that I have just outlined that I am also interested in the area of family policy and industrial relations policy, and I thank the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) for his support of my interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent weeks I have spoken to a number of employers across Australia who have successfully implemented measures to accommodate the family responsibilities of their employees. Apart from the massive social benefits to the country in treating employees like whole people who have lives outside of the company, there are considerable commercial advantages in doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When employees have their minds on the job and not on family problems they are more productive. When employees return to work after parental leave the company does not lose the training investment previously placed in them. And when employees are treated as whole people, when they do not suffer the frustration and guilt associated with not being able to meet their family responsibilities, they go home and make better family members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Business Council of Australia and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> have awarded a number of Australian companies&mdash;and yes, even the multinationals&mdash;for the initiatives that they have taken in this area. Companies such as Esso, Alcoa and Australia Post serve as outstanding examples for other companies to take up the challenge. These companies are leading the way by providing such services as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> family counselling and child care, by allowing flexible working hours, work at home and permanent part&hyphen;time work. They are increasingly seeing the benefits to their employees and, therefore, to their commercial competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main impediments to achieving family friendly workplaces are cultural rather than practical. As these companies improve their competitiveness and are increasingly seen as doing so because of their family policies other companies will follow too. But there is still a long way to go and I intend to play a major part in talking these issues up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I envisage a system in the not too distant future where parents with young children are able to share both the income earning and the child rearing responsibilities in the household by participating in part&hyphen;time work and other family friendly measures for that portion of their working lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Implementation of the government's industrial relations policy will go a long way towards removing many of the barriers built into awards that limit the availability of part&hyphen;time positions and to facilitating the flexibility that parents with children so desperately need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the healthiest society in the world is worth nothing without a healthy environment. Hence the introduction of my third main policy interest, environment policy&mdash;although I suspect that a society which values its children would also value its environment. On both scales Australia has some dreadful shortcomings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate of Kingston has some of the most spectacular scenery that this country has to offer, including the rolling hills and vineyards of the McLaren Vale wine region, which produces many award winning wines&mdash;a fact which I shall be proving shortly to some of my colleagues. But, sadly, our beautiful coasts and hills suffer from the effects of European settlement. I do not doubt that our ancestors never intended to wreak havoc on the landscape and leave behind the chaos for their descendants to deal with. They did not have the information available to them that we have now to understand the effects of our actions on our environment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="885">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do have that information and yet we are still continuing with land use activities that have resulted in the fact that half the mammal species across the world that have become extinct are Australian native species. On recent NGO figures, we are still spewing 33 tonnes of greenhouse gases per person into the atmosphere each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition went to the March election with a policy to establish a trust fund, a substantial fund that would provide the resources to redress Australia's environmental degradation for many years to come. This was the only area of policy in which we made such a powerful and permanent commitment. The establishment of the fund depends upon the sale of one-third of Telstra. I hope that the other place does not deny the restoration of Australia's landscape, waterways and coasts based on a misplaced ideological fixation with public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge all senators and members of the community with an interest in the environment to concentrate their energy on building a corporation that meets the communication needs of all Australians in a fair and equitable manner. The luxury of rigid adherence to a tired old ideological fixation is one that the Australian environment and indeed the Australian telecommunications consumer cannot afford. The emergence of ethically responsible corporations and investment funds could provide models for reference as the Telstra bill moves through the other place and the attention of senators would be usefully employed exploring such avenues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the many wonderful people in my electorate who give of themselves for our community without getting anything in return. There are many dedicated people who collect and sow native seeds to revegetate our barren and eroded landscapes, people who give of themselves to provide transport, aid and perhaps the most necessary service of all&mdash;companionship to our frail and elderly. There are people who work through the churches to provide assistance to families facing hardship and who pick up the pieces when families shatter. There are parents in the school canteen and on the sports field coaching our children. Without <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these people our communities would be much the poorer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economic backbone of Kingston is the small business sector. The coalition's support of small business as expressed in our election policy is one of the reasons that I am standing here tonight. I look forward to continuing to work with the small business people of my electorate to ensure that my government's policies continue to be of benefit to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As federal members of parliament we are well compensated for the work that we do. But I admire those who are elected to local government, and expect that all members will appreciate the commitment of their local government colleagues who give up so much of themselves for their communities. My electorate is indeed most fortunate to be served by mayors Ray Gilbert, Jim Aldridge, Colin Haines and the young Trevor Fletcher, who work tirelessly and too often without thanks to make the south a better place to be. These are the people who really matter in our society across every electorate of Australia, but we are indeed fortunate to have more than our fair share in Kingston. My staff and I look forward to continuing with the productive and harmonious relationship that we have established thus far with the local community to ensure that the south becomes an even better place to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We get a lot of advice in this business, but in closing I would like to acknowledge the advice given to me by the Mayoress of the City of Noarlunga. Edith said to me: `Just enjoy yourself, Susan, and then you can't help but do a good job.' I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker: what better advice could any member get?</PARA></SPEECH>

One hopes that the enthusiasm and vigour with which they have committed themselves to the challenges of public office do not grow dim as the years pass by.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say for myself that after 13 years in this parliament it is a change&mdash;not necessarily a refreshing or stimulating one&mdash;to be on this side of the chamber. I console myself, however, in the belief that it will not be long before Labor regains its rightful place on the treasury bench in this parliament. The bill that we are debating, the Supply Bill, confirms that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that the election of 2 March is part of history and many people are commenting on it or reading messages into the outcome, I will take this opportunity to put a few of my own comments on the public record. Many of the people who voted against Labor were young couples in their thirties who have known nothing but a Labor government in parliamentary terms. These people, in general, live in a large house on a tiny block of land in a new subdivision on an ever rapidly expanding new housing estate. There are a few in my electorate. They usually have two cars in an agapanthus&hyphen;filled cul&hyphen;de&hyphen;sac ready to drop the kinder at the long day care centre. Both of them are in work and mortgaged to the eyeballs and their great worry is whether their swimming pool&mdash;which is slightly bigger than their neighbour's&mdash;will actually fit on their tiny block of land. These are the people who voted against Labor, yet these are the same people whom the conservatives will hit the hardest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello), a couple of weeks ago during question time, was boasting about the view that the conservatives had captured the blue&hyphen;collar vote. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you and I know, this is nonsense. The conservatives captured&mdash;or, perhaps, recaptured&mdash;the middle-class vote. In my area, a traditional Labor heartland, Labor's vote was maintained. In fact, I was one of the few people who actually had a swing towards me. In the suburb of Cringila, for example, Labor maintained 85 per cent of the two&hyphen;party preferred vote, as it did in Lake Heights, Warrawong, Berkeley, Port Kembla and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Warilla. We all got votes of this proportion. There was a slight vote against Labor in the new development areas of West Dapto and Albion Park, which are experiencing a spasm of new housing development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of the last election many people wanted to punish Labor for real or perceived sins. I can well remember advising voters in my area not to give Labor a hiding, and I am proud that the voters in Throsby&mdash;unlike voters in so many other parts of Australia&mdash;stuck with me and Labor. Unfortunately, voters in other areas got their rocks off in five minutes of voting glory. But what a price they will pay, a price some of them are beginning to realise only now&mdash;not least, of course, the members of the National Tertiary Education Union, Wollongong University Branch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of this union were locked in a pay dispute which all four local federal members in the Illawarra area publicly supported. We, in fact, lobbied in Canberra in support of the Wollongong university academics' rightful pay claim. The branch president, Michael Morrissey, wrote to me and my Illawarra colleagues on 18 January advising that the university academics would be voting against us. He said that at a general meeting it was resolved unanimously that the union would be campaigning actively against any party or individual in opposition to their current pay claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The actions included leafleting, a publicity campaign targeting nine marginal seats in New South Wales, participating in anti&hyphen;government demonstrations and determined industrial action. So be it. I, as I am wont to do, responded to that letter. For the public record, I will read part of what I said to Mr Morrissey about this threat to me. I thanked him for his letter of 18 January informing me that the union was going to campaign against the Australian Labor Party in the federal seats of Gilmore and Macarthur. I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you would appreciate, in a democratic society how one casts their vote in a general election is entirely a matter for the individual. If the National Tertiary Education Union feels that they will get a better deal from the conservatives, and on all their social and economic issues that they will be better treated by the conservatives then I suppose, regardless of what I or any other Member or candidate <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="887"> says, they will vote for the conservatives. Being academics one would assume that some research would be carried out into the record in regard to the conservative and ALP policies regarding universities and I would be somewhat surprised if the academics reached the conclusion that they would be better off under the conservatives, but then one lives in a world of surprises. I guess nothing really surprises me. Undoubtedly, too, after a federal election all Labor members&mdash;be they in government or opposition&mdash;will remember the activities of the various interest and lobby groups during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be surprised if the disruption to enrolments of university students was a main issue in the forthcoming federal election. I must say that at this time in the lead up to an election I receive on average four letters a day from various interest groups throughout Australia informing me that unless I take some particular action or endorse some particular program various people will not vote for me.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>It just so happens that I can also remember flicking through the local newspaper a couple of weeks before the election and seeing an open letter from Mr Morrissey suggesting that the ALP should be put last on the ballot paper in the Illawarra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is fair enough in a democratic society, but imagine my surprise when on 1 May 1996 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS> carried an article under the heading `150 uni jobs may be axed'. In that article, Mr Michael Morrissey&mdash;the same Mr Morrissey who had campaigned so loudly during the election period for the election of a coalition government&mdash;complained about academic staff losses and cuts in higher education research grants. The article quoted Mr Morrissey as saying that he urged all residents to write to their local federal members to protest about those cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When residents write to me protesting about those cuts, I send them out a copy of my letter of 22 January to Mr Morrissey. I also send them a copy of Mr Morrissey's letter to me of 18 January. Academics obviously have very short memories; politicians have very long ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, at the front of the University of Wollongong, the students marked out the size of the cuts on university functions and services proposed by the government. I support the students' action, but again I have to wonder whether it is all a little too late. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> University of Wollongong is within the boundaries of the electorate of my colleague the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), but many of the students are from my electorate of Throsby. During the recent election campaign, the student representative council put on a `meet the candidates' seminar. Those who turned out were, in the main, plants or stooges. The average student there was fairly apathetic to the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the member for Cunningham and I warned the university and the students during the campaign about what was in store for them if a conservative coalition was elected. But they were too apathetic to take any action and I suspect that a number of them, especially the academics, voted for the conservatives. So disgusted was the local newspaper at that forum that it gave the article about the meeting the heading `Yawn&mdash;student forum fails'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The students at that university, and universities in general throughout Australia, will pay a price for their apathy and for being so deluded by the conservatives. Incidentally, the impact on the economy of the Illawarra will be in the order of $50 million in wages lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would be aware, speculation has been rife for some time about the government's intention to cut the public sector. Broadly, we have an idea where the cuts will be made and what implication these cuts are going to have. Of course, as all ministers are parroting the same line, we will have to wait until 20 August when the Treasurer announces these cuts in the budget. We know that all Australians are about to face a tidal wave of cuts, with 20,000 Public Service positions being gutted. Every single department and agency will have a date with an axe. There is no place to hide. The effects will be real; they will be felt by all of us and will be very painful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians have always enjoyed the sport of giving public servants a good kick, or making them the butt of some good one&hyphen;liners, but they certainly do not hesitate to pick up the telephone and angrily inform me and my office of what an outrage it is to have to wait in a queue at the local office of the Department of Social Security, the Taxation Office or the CES.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="888">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently we have been hearing about the tragic experiences of abused young children, and children in New South Wales. We have all thrown our arms up in despair. But is there a realisation that perhaps, if the departments charged with ensuring the welfare and wellbeing of these children and young people had been better resourced with staff, some of the experiences these kids have had could have been prevented?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not bleeding heart stuff. It is the reality of cutting back on staff in departments charged with an important service delivery. The former Premier of New South Wales, now the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey)&mdash;and I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Gilmore (Ms Gash) is in the House because she would know this too&mdash;should face the fact, and it should weigh on his mind, that it was his government that inflicted substantial cuts in the Department of Community Services, especially in the Nowra area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Nowra area, it was so bad that the department would only deal with kids who were actually at risk. It did not have the staff there to do the whole of the investigative or reporting work. That was the result of the conservative government in New South Wales cutting funds to that service in Nowra&mdash;and the fact that that was happening was a disgrace. Now it is trying to rectify that and has, over recent months, drastically increased the staff in that department. But it is a matter of training the staff and bringing them up to speed. Had those cuts not been made, I am suggesting that much of the abuse and neglect which has been experienced by many of those kids&mdash;kids we all throw our hands up about when we read of child abuse and neglect&mdash;might well not have happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is being true to the old adage: penny&hyphen;wise and, indeed, pound&hyphen;foolish. Customs Service staff, for instance, will be reduced nationally by 400. In my own electorate, which has the major port facility of Port Kembla at its centre, the Customs Service staff will be cut from 15 to five. But that is not the end of the matter. The remaining staff will now have to operate office hours of nine to 5 p.m.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Port Kembla, one of the busiest port facilities in Australia, will now be a prime target for drug traffickers, shonky importers and others of ill repute. They will know that they will not have to undergo inspections or clearance requirements of Customs&mdash;because all the Customs officers will be able to do there is the paperwork. They will know that, if they arrive at a jetty in Port Kembla, they will not be met by enforcers of the law but by a couple of fishermen angling for a catch. Port Kembla will be open to all kinds of abuse; it will be the gateway of abuse&mdash;and all due to the government's penny&hyphen;wise, pound&hyphen;foolish approach to the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members are aware that I take a great interest in shipping. Later this week I will again have the opportunity to indulge this interest by addressing another foolish piece of legislation. But I have often heard the now minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), and some of his colleagues go on about the cost of shipping operations. These Customs Service cuts and the implementation of office hour shifts to our port will do nothing but increase the costs of shipping. Should a ship arrive outside of office hours of, say, nine to five imposed on Customs Service officials, these ships will be forced to wait out at sea until the office hour shifts recommence on the following day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is the government seeking to reverse the efficiencies made on the waterfront in recent years? Or will it, as I suspect, use this in its hate war with the Maritime Union of Australia? Meetings of trade unions, community groups and public sector organisations have already been held in the Illawarra to campaign against these cuts. Any community, political and industrial campaigns against these unjustifiable attacks on the public sector have my own support and, indeed, that of my Labor colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conservatives have no mandate to savagely cut the public sector, its employees and its services, nor do they have a mandate to close the Wollongong office of the department of immigration, as they announced today. It amazes me that here, in the most ethnically diverse part of Australia, they are going to replace that office of well&hyphen;trained <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="889"> officials with a telephone service. On an average, I would contact that office four times a day. I use that office at least once a day. On some occasions I use it four or six times a day. Every time I use it, I go there as a last resort; it is always a difficult case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my area we have many residents from former Yugoslavia, be they Serbs, Croats or Macedonians. They might be having great difficulties with migration; they might have great concern about families and great worries about visas. How are they going to deal on the telephone with an office in Rockdale when they want an extension to their visa or, indeed, a visa? What if they want to make a personal inquiry or lodge a migration application form? Instead of going to the office in  Berelli Street, Wollongong&mdash;which is their right&mdash;they will have to go to the office in the Sydney suburb of Rockdale. To do that will take them away for a day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone said to me today about the closure of the office in Townsville&mdash;and having been on a committee of inquiry that was looking at people coming down, or the possibility of people coming down, through the Torres Strait and entering Australia there&mdash;do they think that Townsville is next door to Brisbane? I thought it was bad enough with people from the Illawarra having to go to Rockdale, but now it is even worse with the people from Townsville having to go to Brisbane or maybe having to make telephone calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new government has no mandate to sack nurses, police and teachers, to allow fewer TAFE and university admissions, to increase waiting times for nursing homes and child&hyphen;care centres, to allow longer queues at Social Security and CES offices, to close regional Taxation offices and offices of the Family Court and to reduce funding to a host of other important programs and agencies. The justification for these cuts is to satisfy the conservative craving&mdash;to imitate the tactics of Thatcher's Britain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is using the traditional caution of the Treasury to exaggerate the budget deficit and to con the electorate into believing that these cuts are needed. It is a standard textbook approach adopted by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conservative governments throughout the world. The fact is that there is no fat to trim from the bone. Australia cannot afford these cuts. The public sector provides vital community services which Australians are entitled to and indeed deserve. These cuts are not just about job losses; they are about undermining service delivery. We cannot afford to do without the public sector and we will fight to keep it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the government realises the fight they are going to have on their hands. We saw a bit of it in Sydney last Friday. I can assure them that the people of Wollongong and the Illawarra will not accept this. We have always had a reputation for militancy in that area and we will continue that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It saddens me that Australia will go from a country which, over recent years, had one of the lowest levels of industrial disputation in the Western world&mdash;and that is a record that we have held in this country&mdash;to a country which has one of the highest levels of industrial disputation in the world. That is due to the ideological bent of this government to smash the trade union movement. Those who have had a background in the trade union movement will not stand by and see that happen. We will fight these cuts. We will continue to fight attacks on the trade union movement as we have done in the past.</PARA>

I also congratulate my friends and colleagues from both sides of the House on the quality and depth of their first speeches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am honoured to be here to represent the people of Bradfield&mdash;an electorate that covers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="890"> what is known commonly as Sydney's Upper North Shore. Proclaimed in 1949 and named after John Bradfield, engineer and bridge designer, it follows the Pacific Highway from Chatswood West in the south to Wahroonga in the north, across to Belrose in the north&hyphen;east and Castle Cove in the south-east. It is predominantly a residential area, within which live some of the most influential and resourceful people in the country. That is what makes it most special. It also contains a number of light manufacturing, service industries and commercial industries and some government administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the outset, and on behalf of the people of Bradfield, I wish to acknowledge the loyal service and hard work for over two decades of my predecessor, Mr David Connolly, his wife, Monique, and their family and wish them well for the future. I would not be here now if it were not for the dedicated hard work and sacrifice of so many people, only a few of whom can I now specifically recognise. As I mention them, I am reminded of the words of Isaac Newton: `If I could see further than others it was because I stood on the shoulders of giants.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my father who instilled in me the value of education, decent tolerance and respect of others and a work ethic that he thought was always in the Australian Labor Party, thank you. I thank my mother, Pat, for her intelligence and her empathy and for teaching me the importance of having a passionate commitment to those things in which you believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My wife, Kate, married a doctor, not a politician. Yet when I told her on 7 September 1994 that I had `had enough' and would seek Liberal Party preselection, her response was, `I knew that some day you would do this. It is not something I would want for us and our children, but I will do my best to support you.' In giving up what little financial security and privacy we had, moving interstate and then being indirectly subjected to some rather insensitive ridicule and denigration, she has given much more than me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my son, Tom, who has already told me he would `not like to be a politician', and to my daughter, Emily, who understands that I have gone into politics `to help other people', <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thank you. I would also like to recognise a number of those people who at times, with some courage, reached out to support me: Don Glover, my campaign director, mentor and friend; Rhondda Vanzella, the Northern Regional Metropolitan President of the Liberal Party, who recognised the urgency of the party's situation in 1994 and has followed me the length and breadth of Australia ever since to promote the Liberal message; Doug Lowe&mdash;this may seem unusual&mdash;a former Labor Premier, my friend and mentor who taught me that no&hyphen;one has a monopoly on what is right or wrong and to always look for good in others; Bill and Betty Flick; Peter and Norma Beckley; Denise and Ross Reid; Tony Fox, my FEC president; Robert Longstaff; Kathryn Greiner; Michael Yabsley; and, in particular, my friends and colleagues from the Australian Medical Association who in 1993 conferred upon me the privilege of leading what was at times a dangerously difficult agenda for reform but one that was badly needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, I would not be here were it not for the courageous foresight of a man I have come to love, respect and admire, that is, my friend Dr Bruce Shepherd. Above all else, he has taught me the importance of being prepared to fight for the things in which you believe and that the solutions of life will be found in helping others to help themselves and their families. Finally, I mention Raphael Klaesi, a man whom I had never met but who designed the Bradfield logo, which says, quite simply, `Put your heart in it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="891"> There are others whose lives have touched me and who played a significant and critical role in making me who I am. They are people whose names I do not remember. But when you attend a cot death at 5 o'clock in the morning, or you visit a home just after midnight when parents have been informed that their teenage son has been killed in a car accident, or you sit in the kitchen of a modest home where the bank is about to foreclose due to unexpected unemployment, or you visit the home of a young girl who has been raped by her father&mdash;although nothing prepares you for these experiences as you struggle with your helplessness and your inability to pro vide sufficient comfort, more than anything else they are some of the experiences that will keep me true to my principles and certainly not change me by the time I finish here. Those principles are commitment, compassion and conscience instilled in me sequentially by my parents, the Jesuits and the Hippocratic principles upon which the medical profession is based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why am I here? What will drive me and what are some of the issues to which I commit myself? I did not plan on being a politician but there were a number of critical events that happened to me as I went along. On 2 June 1992 I spoke to the National Press Club about unemployment and the health consequences of it. When I had finished, Ian Spicer, the then Executive Director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was asked a question about the employment of young Australians. He got up and gave a reply that was based then on a survey that the chamber had just done of the top 200 employers in Australia. Essentially he was proposing a change to the way in which youth wages and conditions were to be negotiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before he could get his backside back on the chair, Bill Mansfield, the then Vice&hyphen;President of the ACTU, sprang to his feet and said, `Absolutely under no circumstances will the union movement of Australia ever talk to employers about anything like that.' As I stood there listening to this, I thought, `My God, listen to this. Here are the people who create wealth in this country and who could and should employ more Australians saying, "This is what the problem is, whatever the merits of the solution," and then the Labor movement is saying, "No, we're not even going to talk about it," at a time when we have 34 per cent national youth unemployment and 47 per cent youth unemployment in areas like Liverpool in New South Wales.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was Vice&hyphen;President of the AMA, I was told by the Labor health minister that I should `not bother telling the then government what I thought it ought to do and that, if I wanted to change anything that government was doing, I would have to change the government'. I was then told by his successor that people were `wasting their money having <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> private health insurance' and that they ought to do what she did. When I inquired what that was, it was to pay cash. There we were representing a million families in Australia earning less than $40,000 a year, half a million people on health care cards and 800,000 pensioners who still made enormous sacrifices to care for themselves and their families, and government wasn't listening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I went through the preselection experience&mdash;which I know the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) found equally character building&mdash;one of my preselectors said to me, `Dr Nelson, you seem to be in a bit of a hurry. Why don't you wait until you're 40 and your wife has another baby? If you really want to be in politics, we'll find a nice place for you to go where you do not have to cause all this trouble.' The lady next to me suggested that I would be more comfortable in the eastern suburbs with an earring. You are damned right I am in a hurry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every hour of the day our children are going into debt, with Australia's current account problem at the rate of over $2 million an hour. At the end of every day there are 48 small businesses in this country that have gone broke. There are 800 people leaving private health insurance every day to rely on public hospitals because they can no longer afford the premium. So despairing are they of the kind of future they see ahead of them that every day one young Australian between the ages of 15 and 24 commits suicide and another 50 try.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are dozens of families who find day after day what some of us have been on about for a number of years&mdash;that is, unless we change the way that wealth is created we have absolutely no hope whatsoever of providing institutional, residential or nursing home care to the population as it ages. And we were told, `This is as good as it gets.' For people in business, if you did not like it you were instructed by the previous Prime Minister to go back on to PAYE. I can tell you that that is what I am doing, but I do not think that is what he had in mind when he gave the advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have surveyed the people of my electorate to find out the things that are most important <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="892"> to them. Apart from the aeroplanes that have been pushed over our houses day after day, the broadband cables that are being rolled out and over which we seem to have no control and telecommunications towers popping up all over the place, the things that are most important to them are essentially Australia's foreign debt, taxation reform and Australia's health care system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a time when Australians and others frequently referred to us as a `lucky country'; but you do not hear that so often these days. It seems that in many ways luck has become our problem. Over the last 13 years in particular, every year we have sold a little more of our country and we have borrowed more money from overseas to maintain an unsustainably high expectation of what government can provide. Our current account&hyphen;GDP ratio, running at around 5.5 per cent, is more than twice that of any other OECD country. We have run external deficits in 28 of the last 30 years. Our net foreign debt is 40 per cent of GDP. We spend four per cent of GDP servicing our debt and equity obligations, and it is increasing. We have a miserable savings rate nationally of 18 per cent of GDP and a disposable personal income savings rate of three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The much touted ACTU-government accord, about which the member for Batman made great things in his maiden speech, has basically reinforced the very things that stopped job creation. It has reinforced and given support to budget deficits, which have put pressure on interest rates. It has basically supported an inefficient and inequitable taxation system. When you look at the results of the ACTU-government accord you see that in the first 10 years&mdash;from 1984 to 1994&mdash;with an average annual growth rate of 3&half; per cent, 160,000 jobs were created in the private sector. But unemployment still increased from 687,000 to 850,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new `cures' for unemployment&mdash;training, job subsidy schemes, moving widows and middle&hyphen;aged people onto pensions&mdash;do not work. If you talk to people in business, including the businesses in my electorate or anywhere else, you find that they could and should employ more Australians, but they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cannot and they will not because the tax system is far too complex, the industrial relations environment is far too inflexible and they are overloaded with bureaucratic and administrative burdens. These are the things that the Howard government is moving right now to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is time in Australia that we had a serious debate about taxation reform, which has never been a sane pursuit. The first thing we need to do is educate Australians about the language&mdash;what is sales tax, what is payroll tax, what is wholesale sales tax or FBT. The entire system needs simplification. The monumental size and complexity of the Income Tax Assessment Act and the entire industry which surrounds it are in themselves arguments for change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to move away from a tax system which is focused on the very things we are trying to encourage&mdash;employment, productivity and savings. We cannot encourage wealth creation without simplification and we cannot sustain government spending without broadening the tax base. The looming impact of the Internet on tax avoidance completes a picture of national urgency on this issue, to which I will be the most committed during my time here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 30 April this year as saying that `revisiting the consumption tax debate would not be helpful to the ALP'. That may be the case. It is probably not helpful to the government either, and I suspect it will not help my personal political career. But what about us doing something that is `helpful' for Australia's next generation and committing ourselves on both sides of this chamber to putting taxation reform back on the political agenda? The Business Council of Australia's Access Economics modelling, about which the opposition was so preoccupied a couple of weeks ago, calculated long run gains from reform of indirect taxes and subsidies at two per cent of GDP, or $10 billion. We could finance a lot of education, health or Aboriginal services from that amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) said only two <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="893"> weeks ago and I have maintained for a long time, the present health financing arrangements are unsustainable. Australians need to realise that there is a limit to what governments can provide in terms of health care. Until such time as we provide support, political and financial, for people who wish to look after themselves and their families by supporting private health insurance, then frankly we have no hope. I also think it is time that we on both sides of politics worked as much as practicable towards setting some priorities for what the Australian government can and will fund in terms of health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area which I think more than any other during my time here will change the political, economic and social priorities of this country is the ageing of the Australian population. By the year 2001, the number of people over the age of 65 will have increased by 27 per cent. By the middle of the next century, a third of us will be over the age of 65. At present we spend more on housing criminals in Australia than we do on caring for people in nursing homes and residential institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whoever is in government, and hopefully it will be us for many years to come, there will continue to be people who are unemployed. There are serious human and health consequences of unemployment: 50 per cent more doctor visits a year, 35 per cent more admissions to hospital, a death rate which is 17 per cent higher and a 20 per cent higher death rate for the wives of unemployed men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that we ought to be considering, as the Anglican Bishop of Brisbane, Peter Hollingworth, argued unsuccessfully in 1992, that it is time in Australia that we started to pilot on a voluntary basis community development employment programs for people who are unemployed as a means of maintaining a sense of self&hyphen;worth and self&hyphen;esteem. Similarly, it is time that we changed the attitudes of Australians toward those who are unemployed. Most people who are unemployed are unemployed through no fault of their own. They are not dole bludgers or anything of the sort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 13 years we have created a world in which many Australians expect that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Australian government will provide for them and we have cut a whole range of people out of the economic mainstream. I think it is time that we said to every Australian, whoever they are or wherever they were born, `There is a place for you. We will care for you, but we want you to make some kind of contribution to our future.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On average, as I said earlier, one young Australian commits suicide every day, and there are another 50 who try. There are many reasons for it. It would be wrong to say it is entirely the fault of government, but government plays a big role in determining what kinds of values and priorities we have. In looking at the problems young people have we find 30 per cent of those who are looking for a job cannot find one and 60,000 young people in this country are long-term unemployed. There are 22,000 homeless children whom we know of, and we have 600,000 kids living in poverty. We have countless numbers who are remaining in the education system beyond their natural abilities for jobs that they think are not likely to exist. The threshold of resistance to despair has been lowered for a generation that have really lost confidence that we who profess to lead in public life either do not understand or perhaps do not even care about the sorts of problems they face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like my colleague the honourable member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes), I will be arguing for a national office for children and for youth, to put all kinds of legislation up for scrutiny in terms of what it will do for children, to give young people a political voice in the system so that they feel their future is not simply the subject of political exploitation, and to coordinate and advocate programs for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other issues to which I remain deeply committed is that of the health of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Life expectancy is 15 to 20 years less than that enjoyed by non-indigenous people. We are unique amongst countries in the developed world in that we are not reducing the gap between life expectancy for indigenous and non-indigenous people. I spent time in Kenya and in Tanzania <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="894"> for World Vision. People asked me what it was like. Of course it was terrible, but I can tell you that, with the exception of AIDS, I did not see in those countries anything as bad as I have seen in Aboriginal Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many reasons for it, but I think the former health minister, Graham Richardson, gave us some insight into the cause of the problem when, whilst visiting the Kimberleys&mdash;a trip for which I declined an invitation, by the way&mdash;Charles Woolley of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program asked him, `Why, Minister, after 11 years in government, is the situation still so bad?' He said, `I have spent a lifetime reading polls, and concern for Aboriginal people is not in the top million issues worrying the voters.' Amongst the numerous solutions which need to be undertaken and which our government has already commenced, I think we need to work with Aboriginal people, as Noel Pearson said in 1994, to see whether in fact welfare payments can be changed in some way to provide resources to Aboriginal people in a different way which might provide better outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, I am one of those people who watch <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> at 6.30 and I am one of those people who read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>&mdash;please don't tell Phillip Adams that&mdash;and my blood pressure goes through the roof. You ask yourself how one person can make a difference. How can any of us as individuals here, whatever side we are on, make some difference to it? I am not what you would call, I suppose, the orthodox person to be privileged to be the Liberal member for the seat of Bradfield. I did not learn Liberalism the way many of my colleagues did. But, as far as I am concerned, it is the political expression of a life that is spent amongst people. It is about familiarity with hard work, self&hyphen;sacrifice and idealism in everyday life. It is about asking yourself, as Ronald Reagan used to say: is the government the problem or is the government the solution?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real challenge for us is to see that we confront controversy in a constructive and a considered manner, to keep challenging the nation's thinking on a range of fundamental social, health and economic issues. In doing so, I think we need to question whether we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are relating decisions we make to values that society has. Over the last 13 years we have become a selfish country of people who think that their rights are more important than their responsibilities and value is more important than values. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is here tonight and he is a man who represents what leadership is all about&mdash;not the drivel that was fed to us in the election campaign from the other side. Real leadership is about trying to evoke in people a genuine desire to overcome our own self&hyphen;interest, to support things which are best for the community and for the country. Creating common ground and trying to find solutions to intractable problems are far more difficult tasks than ideological invective and party political abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to see this country become one in which we value the health and integrity of human life, as the Prime Minister has demonstrated in the last three weeks, as much as we do achieving our economic objectives. In the end it is what we believe, our sense of values and the way we behave which will determine our destiny&mdash;not some of the things which have preoccupied this House in recent years.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join other members of the House in congratulating the new member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) on an impressive and interesting first speech. I welcome him to the House and note that he moves in a longstanding and extraordinary tradition in the seat of Bradfield in that the first member and now the latest member for that seat started out their political careers with an ALP membership ticket in their pocket. Billy Hughes was the first member for Bradfield between 1949 and 1952. He was known by some in Australian politics as the Little Digger, but I must say that we on this side of the House still call him a Labor rat, because we do have long memories and these things we never forget. The seat has had four members: Billy Hughes, Henry Turner, David Connolly and now Dr Nelson. It is quite remarkable that two of those members started out with the Labor Party. I suppose that we on this side of the House need to take solace from that fact and appreciate that it is probably the only way we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="895"> would ever penetrate a blue ribbon tory seat like that and the only way we would ever penetrate the blue rinse set or the BMW set on the North Shore of Sydney. It is an interesting thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier today we had a debate about the quality of Labor Party preselection outcomes. I can assure those opposite that in the Australian Labor Party, whether you are male or female, whether you are young or old and whether you were born here or born overseas, there is one guarantee, that is, you have served a good apprenticeship for the cause of Labor. You have probably tied a good part of your life, your emotions and your commitment to the cause of Labor. There is none of this walk&hyphen;in, walk&hyphen;out stuff on our side of politics, whereas you can walk into the Liberal Party one day and the next day you walk out as a candidate or even a member of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, while there may be some criticisms from time to time about Labor Party preselection, when it comes to a lifetime commitment for the values that we hold dear, looking at our members and the things they have been through in politics, there is no revolving door. I can assure the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) that there is no walk&hyphen;in, walk&hyphen;out style of preselection and commitment in the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills are the first granting of supply to the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government. It is appropriate for the House to examine the strategies by which this supply will be used and to understand the way in which this government is developing its policy framework. Indeed, I think it is fair to suggest that there are four defining characteristics of the Howard-Fischer government. The first is its repeated breach of election commitments to the Australian people. In the election campaign, Prime Minister Howard put his hand on his heart and promised the Australian people there would be no new taxes or tax increases if he were elected on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then, we have seen a three per cent import tax&mdash;a tax that hits all consumers in all parts of Australia. We are about to see a 0.2 per cent increase in the Medicare levy,  albeit in extraordinary circumstances. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government is even going so far as to moot a death tax in aged care. It has been one of the suggestions for the budget in August. Later this week we will see in the parliament, despite the promise to reduce the uplift factor on provisional tax to six per cent, the permanent rate for small business and for self&hyphen;funded retirees throughout the country being kept at 10 per cent&mdash;in clear breach of coalition election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Away from tax, the record gets no better. The coalition promised that, if they were elected on 2 March, no Australian worker would be worse off. Under their industrial relations policy, the Minister for Industrial Relations, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), supported the individual bargains struck at Tweed Valley. That was a case where the individual contracts transferred $250,000 net in benefits from the workers to the company&mdash;a clear instance of where the workers of that enterprise, under the individual contracts and exploitation, are much worse off. It was an agreement supported by the Minister for Industrial Relations, yet he said that no worker would be worse off under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Industrial Relations is back to supporting a youth wage&mdash;a policy that does nothing more than churn workers through the work force. It simply displaces older workers in the retail sector and replaces them with younger workers at a lower wage. There is no net gain in employment. Those younger workers are worse off, contrary to the coalition's very clear election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has announced that it opposes the ACTU's submission for a living wage, the idea that a higher minimum wage can be struck in Australia, a wage which covers the cost of active citizenship. An initiative which any government should support in a country with a strong traded sector is a strong minimum wage in the non-traded sector. Again, contrary to its commitment to working Australians, it is failing to support the ACTU in that very important submission to the Industrial Relations Commission later this year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="896">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In social policy, the record is even worse. HECS is to go up. There is speculation about a co&hyphen;payment. There has been a breach of the policy to introduce the ISDN telecommunications link throughout all of Australia. There is speculation about increased pharmaceutical payments for pensioners. There is the certain breach of their commitment to maintain financial assistance grants at the projected rate for local government. There are the cuts to the non-government school sector. Again, these are all in clear breach of the coalition's election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The business programs they promised to keep are now under the axe, like the export market development grants program. None of this of course has anything to do with the budgetary position. None of these breaches&mdash;none of these broken promises&mdash;have anything to do with the fiscal position. But do not just trust me on that. Trust the Prime Minister. It was the Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Opposition, who was asked on the John Laws program, `You have a choice: keep your promises at a fiscal cost or break your promises to balance the budget. What is your choice? What is your promise to the Australian people?' Again, he put his hand on his heart and said, `We will keep our promises, even if it means a budget deficit.' So that is the measure of the man, that is the measure of this government and that is the measure of his moral standards in public life. You cannot even believe the Prime Minister's promise to keep his promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government have tried to establish this bogus alibi about the budgetary position. There is one thing about a flaky alibi: sooner or later the cat gets out of the bag. It was the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 12 May who was asked by Laurie Oakes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Treasury revises its growth forecast again, will you change your $8 billion target in the budget?</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer, in response, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, but I wanted to make this point. The black hole was the non&hyphen;disclosure. That was the point&mdash;the non&hyphen;disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA>There in a very neat summary&mdash;a clear question and a clear answer&mdash;is a total exposure of the flaky alibi, the so&hyphen;called budget <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hole. The Treasurer said that if the forecasts change then the fiscal position changes, and the allegation can fall to nothing. The Treasurer acknowledges that, if the growth forecasts by Treasury were to improve, the allegation about a budget problem would dissolve because the question of the fiscal position is not related to May 1996; it is a forecast. It is the Treasury talking about what might happen, in their assessment, between July 1996 and June 1997. It is nothing more than a forecast. If the growth forecasts change, then the budget numbers change&mdash;and he acknowledged that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if the Treasurer is into disclosure and a charter of budget honesty and open government, perhaps he could tell us the latest forecasts. He can whip them together within 48 hours, so we know it can be done. He should make those statistics available to the House. Beyond that, his comments indicated the very good point that he regards the so&hyphen;called black hole to be a question of non&hyphen;disclosure. It is not a fiscal point, it is not a point about the budget. He said it is about whether or not the budget figures, no matter their size, dimension or accuracy in the context of an election campaign, were going to be revealed. It is not a question of the budget forecast for 1996&hyphen;97. He said that this is a disclosure point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The absolutely rich irony is that the Treasurer was talking about a disclosure issue on which he had been a regular forecaster. Back in December, Access Economics published figures to say that because growth is slowing Commonwealth outlays will blow out and revenue will tighten. As a product, the budget will have a larger deficit than the Treasury had initially forecast. That is not surprising. Every single public and private economic forecasting group in Australia has acknowledged for 12 months&mdash;quite sensibly and quite naturally&mdash;that the economy was slowing through that part of the business cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer is saying that even though he had been advised by his shadow treasury, by Access Economics, that the budgetary position was weakening he was willing to go into the election campaign with a particular set of promises which he now cannot fund or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="897"> keep&mdash;so he is seeking an alibi. He is saying, `Look, the Labor Party has done all these things wrong.' But the Labor Party has done nothing wrong or unusual in the lead&hyphen;up to the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What other sources do we have? We have none other than Two&hyphen;neurone Tim, the Deputy Prime Minister, who let it slip in the campaign that the budget was weakening. No less a Liberal authority than Jeff Kennett also said the budget was weakening. So they knew all these things. There is no disclosure issue because they were the ones doing the disclosing in the lead&hyphen;up to the election campaign, saying that the economy was slowing and that the budget position was weakening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no black hole; there is a set of forecasts which can change from day to day, week to week or month to month, depending on how quickly the Treasury cobble together their forecasts. These things have been common knowledge in the public debate, not least within the Liberal and National parties, for at least 12 months. That is the truth and substance of this flaky, weak, dissolving alibi that the Liberal Party has tried to construct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the Liberals trying to hide? It is fairly clear that they are trying to hide the revival of Fightback. The things those on the conservative side of politics truly believe in are called Fightback. That is no secret. But, in their assessment, the things they needed to promise to win an election were not called Fightback; they were called different things that they had no intention of implementing. The things they believe in, the things they want to implement, are called Fightback. This is the sole reason for the construction of this awkward and flaky alibi.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, they are also trying to hide the weakness in their economic strategy. This Howard&hyphen;Fischer government is committed to a low growth, high interest rate strategy. The motto of this government is: all pain, no gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment the economy is not yet at the bottom of the business cycle. And this when the monetary authorities would have been looking for an interest rate cut. There would have been a cut if they had certainty about the future movement of wages. If there had been an agreement with the Australian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trade union movement on wage outcomes 12 to 18 months from now, the monetary authorities, the Reserve Bank of Australia, would have had the certainty by which they could cut rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what happened on election night, 2 March? That certainty was ripped in two, it was thrown out the window. Any concept of cooperation and sensible wages policy agreement with the Australian trade union movement was torn in two. John Howard tore it in two. He ripped away the prospect of wages certainty and, as he did, he dissolved any opportunity the Reserve Bank had in the current economic circumstances to produce the interest rate cut that the Australian economy would otherwise have received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, again, don't just take my word for it. Syntec, the independent forecasting group&mdash;no friend of the Australian Labor Party necessarily&mdash;have said that under a Labor government with the accord in place, with wages certainty, with that certainty in the pocket of the Reserve Bank of Australia, there now would have been an interest rate cut. It is a great shame that that has not been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of that we have had a flow&hyphen;on effect. You cannot have monetary policy in the wrong position without damaging other parts of the economy. People have been asking why the Australian dollar is so high. It is because our underlying inflation rates are too high. The Australian dollar, which is driving down our export competitiveness, which will have a contractionary effect on the economy in the medium term, is too high because the underlying interest rates are too high. They are too high because the Prime Minister tore up the accord on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only home buyers, small businesses and ordinary Australians who are suffering from high underlying interest rates under this government. Exporters, the traded sector and Australia's international competitiveness are also suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say this about the coalition: looking at the sweep of economic policy as it is being made around the world with the globalisation of capital movements, you cannot do anything dumber than rip up wages <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="898"> policy. You could hardly do anything dumber in the current context, because as you globalise the economy your fiscal policy is not the weapon that it was because you get the spill&hyphen;over effects on the external account, your monetary policy is subject to the convergence of interest rate patterns between nations, such is the mobility of capital. So the one thing governments could have left in their hands to have autonomous, national economic policy instruments at their disposal is wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 March, John Howard got in his hands the capacity to form a sensible agreement with the trade union movement and he ripped it in two to the lasting cost of home buyers, small businesses, exporters and the standard of living of ordinary Australians. It was a dumb thing to do. It just underlines the fact that under this government it is all pain and no gain. But, again, don't just trust me on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a debate earlier today about the relationship between fiscal policy and interest rate movements. What does the Reserve Bank have to say about it? The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) has come out and said that his fiscal consolidation strategy will produce an interest rate cut. He does not make interest rates; the Reserve Bank makes them. What did the Governor of the Reserve Bank say on 28 March? He said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What does all this mean for monetary policy?&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>talking about their budget strategy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The short answer, accepting that the foreshadowed fiscal restraint will be delivered, is probably not a lot. There is no presumption at this time of any trade&hyphen;off between fiscal restraint and interest rate reductions.</PARA>
<PARA>So the pain of the $10 billion cuts and their impact on middle Australia and living standards across the nation is all for no gain. No interest rate cut from the horse's mouth&mdash;the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the monetary authority, the man who sets the interest rates says there is no trade&hyphen;off, contrary to the nonsense that the Minister for Finance, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister tell this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at contraction, the other arm of their budget strategy. Look at an economy that is slowing as a deliberate product of this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's policy. You cannot take over two per cent of GDP out of the income expenditure stream and not slow the economy. This budget strategy is knocking half a per cent off the growth rate. It is taking 30,000 jobs out of the public sector and, as they come out of the public sector, jobs come out of the private sector because there is a loss of spending power, particularly in regional economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You get a loss on average of $67 million worth of spending power out of every federal electorate. If you divide the $10 billion cut by 148, there is $67 million of lost public spending power coming out of every electorate and there is no automatic replacement effect by the private sector. In Campbelltown, in Liverpool, in the seat of Werriwa that means unemployment, that means a slowing economy, that means a loss of resources, a loss of aggregate demand and spending power that just will not be replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But again, look at what the coalition's own fellow travellers have to say. Access Economics in its five-year forecast: `The budget is shaping up as a key short-term negative for 1996-97.' It is going to push unemployment back over nine per cent. `These policies will bleed money away from the wholesale and retail trade sector', the very backbone of the small business sector that this government says it supports. So it is all the pain of a contracting budget, higher underlying interest rates and a loss of international competitiveness out of the appreciating dollar and all for no gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House is entitled to ask, as are businesses and households across the nation: where is the growth coming from over the next 12 months? It is not coming out of the interest rates; they are too high. It is not coming out of the appreciating Australian dollar because it is driving down competitiveness. It is not coming out of fiscal strategy because the budget is being contracted. The growth is coming from nowhere other than the prospect of the international business cycle. This is an historic change for the Australian economy because under the previous government we led the world, not only on the OECD growth <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="899"> table but in leading the world out of the bottom of each business cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what is happening under the Howard-Fischer government? We are falling off the back of international growth. We are falling off the back of the rest of the world in terms of the opportunities we could make of global markets&mdash;all pain and no gain, particularly in regard to living standards, the social wage cuts, the high underlying interest rates, the deregulation of the Australian labour market. What does it add up to? It adds up to a government that has no answers, a government that effectively wasted its years in opposition, ripped itself apart, Left versus Right, Howard versus Peacock. The things they believed in&mdash;they popped out in 1993; it was called Fightback. They have no mandate to do those things. They have no answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no answer in the twin deficits theory that the Treasurer subscribes to. That was tried at the end of the 1980s. It did not work. There is no answer in the competitive advantage theory. You can have all the micro&hyphen;economic reform and competition policy under the sun and it will not produce full employment in Australia because of regional and labour market imbalances. They have tried reduction of the welfare state in other parts of the world&mdash;the United Kingdom, throughout Western Europe, the United States. It just does not work. This is a government without answers, a government without any hope of improving living standards throughout the Australian community, a government which deserves to be thoroughly condemned by this House as it deals with the first supply bills of the Howard-Fischer administration. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have come to this place from the mother of Australian parliaments, the New South Wales Legislative Council, to what I am constantly advised, particularly by those who have made <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it to this place, is the greatest chamber in Australian parliaments, the super league, if you like. Having departed from the Legislative Council with few regrets and high hopes, I certainly will not disagree with that assessment. I am not the first to make the transition from the place Henry Lawson described as `the fossil house'. Six others have come before me and two still sit in this chamber and have made firm and, I would add, distinguished imprints. In following the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin), I hope not to let the side down. Indeed, I feel quite at home here, where the standard of debate in my view approximates more the quality of debate in the Legislative Council as opposed to what passes for debate in the New South Wales lower house bearpit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as I look across the chamber and see the rump of the Labor Party I sometimes wonder how debate will continue. It seems that even though they have been given a spanking by the Australian people they still like to lecture us. So please forgive me if tonight I use the lectern and I lecture you a little bit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), I sometimes suspect, because we did spend some time together at the college of law, that some people that know us both would fear for the safety and future of our country. But I do suspect also&mdash;and I hope sincerely&mdash;that the standard of both of our debates has improved since those carefree days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyway, the standard in this place, which I think is very good, is a new phenomenon for which we should be indebted to the new House rules under the new enlightened management. And I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our new Speaker on his well&hyphen;deserved elevation and his refreshing manner in the chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the words of sympathy by the Governor&hyphen;General, on the opening of parliament, for the victims, their families and friends, who have suffered and will continue to feel the pain for the rest of their lives as a result of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="900"> the tragedy in Port Arthur. Among those who died was Zoe Hall, a young solicitor who was my constituent and with whom I played competition squash some years ago. Zoe was one of the most delightful people you could ever wish to meet. My sad condolences are extended to her family and many friends. They must be suffering a grief we can only begin to imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few weeks ago, when I took the oath of office, my family Bible was left behind in all the excitement. As I could not contemplate beginning my federal parliamentary career without the blessing of my ancestors, I have it here with me today. As is the custom, it lists the birth and death dates of Mutches. My great&hyphen;grandfather, William Murdoch Mutch, is listed there. He came to Australia from the Scottish highlands in the 1880s. Written also in the careful copperplate writing of my grandfather, Francis William Tait Mutch, a veteran of World War I, is the name of his mother, Sarah Davies Mutch, who, as a young woman, bravely journeyed across the seas on her own with four young boys, the progeny of William's first union, as well as her own babe in arms, Thomas Davies Mutch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My political inspiration, Tom Mutch, was a minister in the Storey, Dooley and Lang governments. With Lang, he clashed bitterly, and was eventually a refugee from the hate&hyphen;filled factions of the New South Wales ALP. Things have not changed, as the shadow minister for competition policy, who knows all about cronyism and nepotism, would vouch for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1934, Tom Mutch contested the federal seat of Werriwa as a UAP candidate. He narrowly failed, and I feel great pride in fulfilling, at last, this ancestral ambition to go federal. I also have a few inherited scores to settle with the ALP, who ratted on a good man when they abandoned Tom Mutch. On my mother's side, I am a seventh&hyphen;generation Australian, a descendant of Edward Whitton, an entrepreneurial convict who arrived aboard the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Scarborough</EMPHASIS> on 26 January 1788. I am also the descendant of Antonio Crameri, who left the beautiful Swiss valley of Poschiavo, over a century ago, to seek a new life in this wide, brown land.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make mention of these ancestors because they were immigrants and pioneers and, in remembering them, I am also reminded that we who have inherited the comparative luxuries of Australian citizenship should respect the determination and often the courage of those today who sometimes battle great odds, both physical and bureaucratic, to come to our country. We who have been born lucky can never afford to be complacent about our custodianship of this bountiful land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have travelled a bit&mdash;not nearly enough&mdash;across this great nation. As a modern man, I have seen Uluru, on a fine day, from a Qantas jet. I swear it pulsated like the great heart it resembles from above. I have swum among the warm coral waters of the Great Barrier Reef. I have been to the back of Bourke and seen Michael Cobb's monster sign by the Mitchell Highway. I have dodged kangaroos at Cunnamulla, perspired at Mungo and eaten pasta on Lygon Street. I have paid homage at the shrine of Peter Lalor, that great conservative rebel. What I have seen is a vast country with few people and unbounded potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having had some experience in government and opposition, albeit as a back seat passenger wondering at times who is doing the driving, whose foot is on the accelerator, I have arrived at some simple pragmatic beliefs. I do not altogether subscribe to John Fahey's argument that vision is bulldust. But I have come to the conclusion that the four&hyphen;way test inscribed on Rotary gift pens is about as much philosophy as anyone needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do need to have a dream, a plan for the future and a road map detailing the course we would like to take. We also have to have some idea about the mechanics of the vehicle that is supposed to get us there. I believe that members of this government and its ministry have a great deal of confidence and certainty about where we are going. My only caution is that I believe we should temper economic rationalism&mdash;which is good in a measured dose&mdash;with economic nationalism, which recognises the realities of a chaotic world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My experience as a diligent government backbencher has left me with a repository of experience which I hope will be of some use to this government. Much of what I believe <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="901"> to have been useful was my work on parliamentary committees. I served a long time and attended, I think, a record number of meetings of the Regulation Review Committee, which did an enormous amount of work to unstrangle the people of New South Wales from bureaucratic red tape. As chairman of a backbench committee, I wrote reports on the security protection industry and the private investigations industry. I am very proud of my efforts, particularly in relation to the security protection committee; but, alas, the benefit of both these reports is yet to be utilised by the New South Wales government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As chairman of, or participant in, many other committees, parliamentary backbench or party, I wrote or contributed to many reports. One of the most interesting I wrote was on the question of voluntary voting. In all of this, while some recommendations were implemented&mdash;usually by appropriation&mdash;I regret that all the enthusiastic work that goes into the nitty&hyphen;gritty of political and parliamentary life is often overlooked in the expedience of seeking and maintaining power for its own sake. I will therefore be one who is aware and vigilant of the need for governments to listen to the views of the party room, to seriously review the copious work done by backbenchers, and to take with a grain of salt the advice of those who spend their lives in plastic bubbles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My personal beliefs have been shaped by a family upbringing where we moved to the Sutherland Shire in 1969 and built Kankinya Kindergarten, which is run today by my sister Annette. As a family business, it was all hands on deck. I used to clean and polish the floors at night. Later we built a caravan park at Heathcote, where we did all the landscaping ourselves. While my father worked in the textile industry to provide a stable base, it was my mother who established the family businesses. Now my father has dedicated his retirement so far to Heathcote Tourist Park. In fact, we have given him a rare day off today to be here in the gallery with my mother Shirley, my sisters Annette and Julie&hyphen;Anne, Aunty Pat, my cousin Maureen, my wife Jenni, and baby daughter Grace Elsie&mdash;Baby Gracie. It is easy to see that behind every <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hopeful man there are a dozen women propping him up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall reading prior to my preselection an article describing the electorate of Cook as the perfect seat. It is bounded to the north by historic Botany Bay and the Georges River and, to the south, by the sparkling waters of the Hacking River, reflecting the beautiful gums of the Royal National Park. Our eastern boundary consists of the golden beaches of Bate Bay patrolled by world renowned surf lifesavers. Cook is also the home of ET and the mighty Sharks: no member could ask for more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electorate of Cook is also now a blue&hyphen;ribbon Liberal seat. Before the election, the margin in Cook was 3.5 per cent. It is now over 12 per cent, representing a massive swing of nearly nine per cent&mdash;extraordinary in a seat held by the coalition prior to the election. This spectacular result can be attributed to a number of factors, not least being the Howard factor, the Keating factor, and a positive local campaign which was run from my home in Sylvania Waters&mdash;our home, I should say. Our home became the focal point for all activities; our home number was posted on billboards all around the electorate. The atmosphere was festive, reflecting the palpable feeling all around that this time we would make a difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to reveal our trade secrets to the ALP, which obviously needs them, but they ran a negative and clueless campaign in Cook. In fact I am still waiting for my opponent to concede defeat; someone should tell him. But I can reveal that our engine was stoked by Beatrice Brown's jam tarts and chocolate cake, and by Ida and Bill Mowbray's delicious sandwiches, the piles of which were only kept in check by the voracious appetites of the Miranda&hyphen;Cook Young Liberals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Day after day teams from the Woolooware branch, the Sylvania branch and the Cronulla women's branch came to our home to produce the material that was distributed by other teams on the weekend. There are so many to thank, but at the risk of leaving some out I would like to thank Norma and Bruce Scotland, Uncle Kevin and Adrienne Schreiber, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="902"> John and Pauline Chad, Clive and Vicki Johnson, Marilyn and Tony Parkes, Dallas and Wade McInerney, Duncan Riley, Frank and Heather Newbery, Kathy and Anthony Clarke, Brenda Grosz, Barry and Katrina Munns, Les and Val Coy and Beth Adams&mdash;the A team&mdash;Nona Henderson, Thea Brown, Joan Walton, Marj Dyson, Myrt Little, Pam Lewis, Heather Parker, Julie and Noel Foldi, Pat Monk, Richard Cohen, Craig Farr, Natasha Johnson, Jack (General Patton) Hicks, Matt and Brook Daniel, Eric and Jan Dobbie, Charlie Francis and Jack Slattery, Roy Helm and Andrew Wilson&mdash;and those from far away, such as Robyn Young, Ann Youl and Rocky Wood, who all combined to send me to Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I leave till last my campaign manager and daughter's godfather, Malcolm Kerr MP, the member for Cronulla, who believes that the turning point in the campaign came when we changed the authorisation on pamphlets from M. Kerr to the unabridged Malcolm Kerr. How can I possibly disagree?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a massive effort, but the feedback was overwhelming. We received over 2,000 responses to our surveys. People were genuinely delighted that they had been given an opportunity to have their say, and I wrote back to them all. One regret I do have is that the Hon. Paul Keating has chosen not to be with us today because many voters asked me to convey personal messages to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have come to this place with a shopping list of things I would like to raise early in the life of this parliament. For some years I have been interested in the issue of preserving the census on microfiche for the future use of medical, historical, demographic and cultural researchers. My good friend Nick Vine Hall, Australia's pre-eminent genealogist, who is in the gallery tonight, is leading a campaign of tens of thousands of Australians to review this act of historical vandalism. They know that by destroying raw census data we are failing to record the existence of every Australian for posterity. Other records provide only pieces of the mosaic that represents our population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also to consider the important issue of medical research. Only yesterday a noted geneticist, Dr Max Nicholls of the University <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of New South Wales, said in frustration that `the census could provide an invaluable tool for future researchers into rare diseases and in forensic science, and it is an act of stupidity to destroy it'. I fully agree and have undertaken to pursue this issue in the party room.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of airport noise is one of major interest to many in my electorate. I would like to commend the decisive and professional approach of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and his advisers in the implementation of our election policies and in the follow-up of issues raised. This has been in marked contrast to the fudging, dishonest approach of the previous government. For instance, I am pursuing the issue of aircraft on take-off turning east out to sea after passing Kurnell, therefore avoiding the Cronulla peninsula entirely. In a meeting organised by the minister, I was surprised to discover that this issue had not been properly assessed by the previous government. It will be done now and proper answers given, whether they be favourable or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People are looking for an honest approach and decisions&mdash;something not given to them before. The fact that the long&hyphen;suffering people of Kurnell voted for me in preference to my ALP opponent, giving me a 20 per cent swing and an historic victory at Kurnell, is an indication of the anger and frustration they felt towards the duplicity of the ALP. I may not be able to offer them salvation, but at least I visited them all and listened to their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plight of small business is also a matter that received considerable attention in my campaign, and I am pleased to see that the government is moving quickly to focus on removing impediments imposed on small businesses, many of them by government, to free up this sector, the real engine room of our economy. I have convened a local small business task force, chaired by Frank Dowling of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shire Monthly</EMPHASIS> business monthly magazine, which has already met, to link in with the government's small business task force and report to the government on ideas and suggested reforms emanating from our local perspective. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="903">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing I am doing to serve as a conduit between small business and government is to make myself available on Saturdays. I call it my Saturday surgery&mdash;with apologies to all the doctors who are with us tonight&mdash;so that people like small business proprietors who cannot see me during the week have this opportunity to bring their concerns to me. I am getting a great response and feel that these representations will drive much of my activity in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An issue has been raised with me by Bernie Clarke of the Botany Bay Planning and Protection Council. He is concerned about the degradation of Towra Point, an area in my electorate with international significance for migratory birds. It could well be that a possible solution to wave erosion caused by the dredging of Port Botany and the construction of airport runways is the construction of a below surface breakwater to ameliorate the frequency of wave action. I have written to the minister seeking advice on whether a proposal might be submitted under our coast and clean seas initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This project, along with many others I would like to advance in the environmental interests of my electorate, depends on the Telstra legislation achieving passage through the Senate unamended&mdash;a fact I am sure is appreciated by those many Democrat voters who gave me their preferences on 2 March. While my Labor opponent ran a negative campaign on two issues only&mdash;the sale of Telstra and the local environment&mdash;I was still able to attract 52 per cent of Democrat preferences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As I explore more of this place, I am often asked where I am from. When I mention Cook and Cronulla many comment on my predecessor, the Hon. Don Dobie MP. The word that springs to most people's lips is an old&hyphen;fashioned word&mdash;gentleman. Don Dobie has been a father to his electorate for over a quarter of a century. My own early political hopes were inspired by a trip to Parliament House, now Old Parliament House, where my class from St Patrick's College, Sutherland, was looked after by Don Dobie. I hope that after my sojourn in this place I will be re membered with nearly as much affection as Don Dobie. I wish him well in his retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am continuing his tradition. Today I went and saw pupils from Kirrawee Public School who came to visit this great place. Most of the pupils who put their hands up when asked whether they would like to be Prime Minister were the girls. That is a sign of things to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing I would like to thank my family for continuing to be the most important influence on my career and, of course, my whole life. My wife, Jenni, and baby daughter, Grace, are a constant source of pride and joy to me. Some members might be aware that in my political career so far I have not avoided difficult issues and have been subjected to some bitter personal attacks and suffered some disgraceful public vilification and much harassment. That is well known to my friends Dr Max and Meg Wallace, who are also in the gallery tonight. Frankly, none of this has had the slightest effect on my morale because the people who matter to me are sitting up in the gallery, with me as always.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Cook (Mr Mutch) on his maiden speech and particularly commend him for the respect paid to the former member for Cook, Don Dobie, who gained the respect of all members on both sides of the parliament. Before speaking on the supply bills, I want to congratulate the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) on his election as Speaker of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last parliament it was my pleasure to work with the honourable member for Casey, who was the deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I am sure in expressing my delight and pleasure at his election to that position that I am also expressing the good wishes not only of the members of that committee but also the secretariat of that committee. To date, as Speaker, the honourable member for Casey has endeavoured to do his best to display fairness to both sides of the House and that comes as no surprise to members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. He has our best wishes and goodwill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="904">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl on his appointment as Deputy Speaker. He was kind enough to refer to a friend of mine, Clarrie Millar, who is no longer a serving member of this House. Clarrie was a very colourful member. There is no point in my pointing out to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we had the pleasure of serving together in the last parliament on the Procedure Committee. Some of the things we tried to tackle were not easy. The thing that stood out in my mind was always your reasonableness&mdash;that is, you are prepared to give things a go and take a reasonable approach in all the deliberations. This trait, in your new role as Deputy Speaker, will stand you in good stead, and I would like to personally extend my congratulations to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I did not mention the election of the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), I would draw some ire from this side of the House. While we express confidence in the roles that both you and the Speaker will fulfil, we have already had three years of Harry. I am sure that Harry, too, will continue to make the mark in this parliament that he did in the last parliament, but under different circumstances, and that he will enhance the top panel of three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because one of the supply bills is for the parliamentary departments, it gives me the opportunity to talk about what might constitute an independent Speaker and what might constitute better parliamentary behaviour. This is one of the aspects that the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) took into the last election, and presumably we will see it in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the fairness of your good self and Mr Speaker, it is always the opposition which will support you most stridently in that regard because we are the ones who will be the great beneficiaries of any demonstration of fairness. In fact, it is usually governments of the day which try to restrict the opportunities of Speakers and Deputy Speakers in dispensing fairness. Mr Deputy Speaker, I say to you and to Mr Speaker that you can always look to this side of the House when you are valiantly trying to make fair rulings, and you will have our total support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought I should draw to your attention something that has proved quite successful in the Senate in improving parliamentary performance. Admittedly, the government of the day was quite critical of the initiative but, as I say, it has stood the test of time. Speaker after Speaker has complained about the fact that they are restricted by current standing orders and that they can only apply them as they stand, notwithstanding the many points of order that are drawn to their attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Senate has adopted a time limit of one minute on questions and four minutes on answers. As I said, initially the government of the day&mdash;which was our side&mdash;was quite hostile to the change, but it has improved performance immeasurably. It is interesting that the new government has gone along with that system. Maybe, if it tried to change it, it would not have the numbers, but there no longer seems to be an argument amongst senators about the time limitation on questions and answers in question time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say that, after fairness, the preparedness of the government&mdash;after all, they have overwhelming numbers&mdash;to introduce such a limitation here in the House of Representatives is another test of improving parliamentary performance. Do it for a trial period, if you like, under standing orders. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have introduced standing orders for a session only, but I think it would be of great benefit to the government because it would discipline the ministers, as it has in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose I am a little old-fashioned, and I sincerely apologise for that. I have always described myself as a sort of traditional Labor man. One of the traditions in this place that I particularly enjoy, and I think I share this with the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), is the ability of members of parliament to get up, other than in second reading debates or maiden speeches, and give a speech without reading it&mdash;none better than Clarrie Millar, whom we were talking about a little earlier. If it is not introduced or not enforced by the Speakers or Deputy Speakers, I would certainly encourage <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="905"> all the new members who have made their maiden speech thus far to get to the point where they can actually deliver a speech without reading it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recount to the House the time when I was sitting on the government side listening to an opposition member and busily doing some work. I suddenly heard him intone that he took exception to government members laughing. I immediately spun around to see which government members were laughing. There was none, but it was written in the speech and he faithfully read it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue I would like to raise in terms of lifting parliamentary standards and the role of parliament is one that my colleague the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) raised this morning&mdash;that is, amalgamating the parliamentary departments. It is an issue of great sadness to me that Mr Speaker has started off his reign by cutting back committee staff. There are some real savings to be made both in efficiency and in money by getting away from this anachronism of every department within the parliament having its own parliamentary head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not trying to point score, but it is a matter of record that we have tried previously to make what is a sensible, micro-economic reform and productivity improvement but which has been hotly resisted by senators, in particular the now government senators. But, if we are asking the workers and industry out there in voter land to make sensible changes, sometimes we also have to demonstrate that we are part of that scene and act consistently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also in terms of accountability&mdash;and I mean no disrespect or impertinence to the Speaker, as I have already raised this with him&mdash;the House of Representatives department is the only department, whether it is a quango or it is a department of state, that does not have any scrutiny. I know that governments of the day or, more appropriately, the executives of the day delight in that particular situation. It is convenient to the Presiding Officers, because they are able to bury expenditure in the Department of the House of Representatives. But, again, particularly from a government that is hacking and slashing on expenditure, it seems to me to be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quite a contradiction that the Department of the House of Representatives does not have a staffing and appropriations committee, which could basically assist Mr Speaker and the Deputy Speakers in the administration of that important department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have long been an advocate of the committee system, which was a very recent product in the 1980s, for the House of Representatives. Amongst a lot of benefits, I always think of it as the university of the parliament&mdash;that is, the opportunity to meet the best academics, the top public servants and people in private capacities. It is an opportunity to test and to weigh up your views. In the majority of cases, committee reports are bipartisan reports and they do not reflect lowest common denominator approaches. I think committees are absolutely great and they do this parliament great service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they are badly in need of reform. I have to say to honourable members that we are really setting a bad example. Firstly, we are maintaining too many committees. We are not reviewing the number of committees nor reviewing how effective it may be for a member of parliament to serve on&mdash;I think `to serve' is an overstatement&mdash;or at least to be a member of so many committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I said to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is really the members of parliament who serve on committees that make the difference, you of course, in your singular way, would pull me up and say that it is really the quality of the support staff and the tremendous effort they put in that makes us perhaps look better than we might otherwise be. It is an absolute tragedy that we are now going to prune committee staff, because we will limit the effectiveness of committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see fewer committees and more staff. An idea I floated in my own committee in the last parliament is that I think it would be absolutely fabulous if we could change the employment conditions for some positions and offer university graduates a traineeship, if you like, for one year where they would not be paid full Public Service salaries but they would get an opportunity to work with a parliamentary committee, with all the benefits that conferred. It would be on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="906"> their curriculum vitae and they could then move on to a course position that they sought. If we were able to give young people that sort of opportunity and they were able to then move on, we would get the best of both worlds. We would have young brains and young enthusiasm. We would be giving them an opportunity and getting all the advantages from that. They in turn would be getting an opportunity to go into some very worthwhile careers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When talking about having an independent Speaker or enhancing the role of parliament, these are the sorts of benchmarks I think we should set and against which people could judge, perhaps whenever we again go to the polls, how successful Mr Speaker and his deputies have been and how successful the Prime Minister has been. From a very sincere point of view, I wish them well. I would be absolutely delighted if I were to learn very shortly that all of them were to be implemented. I fear that that will not be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a few minutes to talk about the Supply Bill (No. 2), which allocates $1.720 billion. Again, I want to return to a point that I made in an earlier speech: unfortunately, members of parliament are not held in high esteem, in particular when we are seen to be duplicitous, cynical or breaking promises. I think it is unfortunate that the Prime Minister has based much of his approach, in terms of slashing and hacking the expenditure, on the allegation of a black hole of $8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you, having listened to so many debates and contributions from different members, would know that that $8 billion represents an estimate by Treasury about how the economy is likely to be, rather than an actual overspend or overdraft. As I said a little earlier, it is not as though Mr Howard has a note from the Governor of the Reserve Bank saying, `Dear Prime Minister, I regret to advise you that you have spent $8 billion more than you have.' These are projections; that is what he is talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, it ill&hyphen;becomes the Prime Minister to start lecturing and hectoring the opposition when he was advised by Treasury when he was the Treasurer that there was a $9.6 billion <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> overspend&mdash;not an estimate but actual&mdash;and he chose during an election to keep that quiet. Translated into today's dollars, that $9.6 billion is not an $8 billion overspend or black hole. It is something like $25 billion in 1996 dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that we on this side of the House find so difficult is that the Prime Minister will not come clean and table the Treasury or Department of Finance advice about what the costings of his election promises were. After all, he said he would introduce a charter of budget honesty. If we asked people whether they are in favour of a charter of budget honesty, of course they would say yes. Do they want members of parliament, Prime Ministers and Treasurers to act honestly? Of course they would say yes. Why, then, do you disappoint those who would support you by not acting consistently, by not tabling that information? Is it true that that estimate of election promises is in fact $4 billion? I believe it is. There is one way it can be settled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, I would like to say that there has been a lot of speculation about the budget and how many public servants are going to lose their jobs. I know that, out in voter land, having a go at public servants is pretty good fun, particularly if you can identify them as being Canberra public servants. But let me say that one in five public servants employed on the Commonwealth payroll actually lives and works in Canberra. Four out of five work in electorates like yours, Mr Deputy Speaker, like mine, and like that of the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), the shadow minister at the table. So when we say we are going to hack and slash public servants, what we are really saying is that we are going to have fewer public servants to do the same jobs that they were doing in our own electorates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expressed a concern to the head of the Prime Minister's department, when we were on the expenditure committee, that you can get more and more efficient public service activity. But, if you are not careful, you lose sight of what the actual job is that you are trying to do. Take someone, for example, trying to ring a Department of Social Security <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="907"> office. You have to go through a telephone queuing system, you have to be competently able to identify what it is that you want, but you actually cannot ring your local office any more. I think that is sad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one thing Australians ought to have as a fundamental right, it is to be able to talk to the decision maker in the public service face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face&mdash;or at least on a telephone. You settle far more problems better in that way than you do through these anonymous queuing systems. Not everyone is functionally literate and, particularly in my electorate, old people and people who are functionally illiterate have great difficulty with some of the technological innovations. We should understand the disadvantages that we are placing them under.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to finish my address as I began it. I would like to sincerely congratulate you on your elevation, and also Mr Speaker. It is said that members of parliament come into this place with a prime ministerial baton in their knapsacks. A lot of us would say the highest honour any member of parliament can have is to serve as Speaker or Deputy Speaker.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pertinent to the supply bills we are debating tonight is getting our current account back in order. Earlier today, in a speech I made which was cut short, I referred to my dismay at the fact that Premier Carr had put the kybosh, if you like, on a potential goldmine in the south of my electorate, on the border between my electorate and the electorate of the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), at Lake Cowal. If the mine was allowed to go ahead it would return $1,200 million in export earnings to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the Premier has stopped that mine for all the wrong reasons. Before he did so he set up a commission of inquiry into the possibility of letting that mine go ahead. That commission called for submissions and 118 came in&mdash;most of which, I might add, were in favour of the mine. The Premier and his relevant minister, Craig Knowles&mdash;the Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning, and Minister for Housing&mdash;set up the commission. They appointed the commissioners, as is their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> right, and they set the terms of reference for the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They appointed the highest people possible for that inquiry, namely, the Chairman of the Office of the Commissioners of Inquiry for Environment and Planning, Mr William Simpson, and the Deputy Chairman, Mr Kevin Cleland. So they had top people for that inquiry who, when they sent their 120&hyphen;page report to the Premier, wrote a covering letter of three paragraphs. I will just read the last paragraph which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our report canvasses the various conservation, environmental, developmental and social issues brought before the Commission of Inquiry. We have weighed and balanced these aspects of the proposed development and are satisfied,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that, `are satisfied'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">subject to compliance with the strict conditions we recommend, that conservation and environmental considerations do not preclude you granting consent to the Lake Cowal Gold Project.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is. I cannot go through the whole 120 pages but if we turn to the executive summary that they put before the Premier, it is interesting to read out a few paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Submissions were received from 118 parties. The Department of Mineral Resources and the Bland Shire Council&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is based on West Wyalong in New South Wales&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">strongly support the proposal as do many of the businesses in West Wyalong. The Australian Heritage Commission, Department of Urban Affairs and Planning, the Environmental Protection Authority and the Department of Land and Water Conservation note the potential for ecological impacts but do not object subject to strict conditions of consent . . . Government agencies generally recognise the local economic and social importance of the development. The majority of local landholders support the development provided their amenity and livelihood is protected.</PARA>
<PARA>In the next paragraph they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our assessment we have recognised that the conservation significance of Lake Cowal must not be underestimated or compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On weighing and balancing the scientific and technical evidence before the Inquiry we are satisfied that the impact of the Lake Cowal Gold Project on the environment of Lake Cowal will be low and will not be ecologically significant in the short or long term. The contrary views of some parties are not supported by the evidence. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="908"> </PARA>
<PARA>Of the 118 submissions, 75 were in favour, and others from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and some of the green groups were against but, as the commission of inquiry clearly says, the contrary views of some parties are not supported by the evidence. They summed up by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have concluded that a maximum cyanide level of 50 mg/L CN(WAD) as proposed by the Company should apply to the tailings discharge. We also recognise the need for the conservation of biodiversity and ecological integrity to be assured at Lake Cowal. Consequently, we recommend that as well as the extensive monitoring proposed by the conditions of consent the Company fully fund a waterbird conservation program to be undertaken jointly with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are satisfied that the Lake Cowal Gold Project will bring positive economic and social benefits to Bland Shire and the State and that it will not compromise the recognised national and international conservation values of Lake Cowal in the short or long term, subject to the conditions of consent we recommend to control and mitigate potential environmental impacts.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is, a very clear recommendation indeed to go ahead with this goldmine that would have created 180 jobs directly with an average wage for the workers in this country of $60,000 each per year. The Premier came out at the end of one <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>  program and knocked it on the head and did not tell the mining company, North Ltd, until three days later that this mining project, which would have been the largest goldmine in New South Wales bringing $1,200 million of desperately needed export income to this country, had been rejected. The Premier based that on a 4&half;&hyphen;page report that was written by a Gabrielle Kibble, the Director&hyphen;General of the Department of Urban Affairs and Planning.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Interestingly enough, she is a daughter, I believe, of the late Sir John Kerr. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While many of the environmental risks of a gold mine proposal can be adequately monitored and safeguarded, any risk in the Lake Cowal environment may not be tolerated given the significance (national and international) of the wetland.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say in this report:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . risks cannot be totally eliminated unless mining does not place.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if an activity of mining takes place at Lake Cowal there will be some risk, no matter how small, and that is not acceptable. She has brought a new standard into mining in this country which must mean that because any mining encompasses some risk, there is to be no mining in Australia. That is the logical extrapolation of what this lady has said. It has set an incredible standard in this country. I have a letter from the Executive Director of the Minerals Councils of Australia, David Buckingham. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, if the NSW Government was to apply the same criterion of no environmental impact, it would, by denying all development options, effectively shut down the State.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the things that Gabrielle Kibble raises in her 4&half;&hyphen;page letter is blasting. She says that blasting and associated vibrations will have an impact on bird breeding at Lake Cowal. But the birds that breed there are five kilometres away from where this development is proposed. What are the vibrations going to be like five kilometres away from the blast?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last weekend I was at Peak Hill where we have just opened a new goldmine. It is half a kilometre from the central business district of the town and they blast at Peak Hill every day. The blast lasts for one second and the vibrations at the nearest house, which is only 200 or 300 metres away from the blast, are of the order of one millimetre and last for one second. That is acceptable to the human beings who live there. While the blasting is going on, the birds which have got used to it fly around and do not take much notice of it. At Lake Cowal the birds are five kilometres away, yet the vibrations on the ecosystems of Lake Cowal are apparently going to adversely affect the breeding of the birds there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this sort of nonsense that has shut down a $1,200 million project. We must be the richest country in the world if we can afford, based on this sort of nonsense, to turn away $1,200 million. I will just read from a report by an eminent ornithologist and wetlander, Dr Peter Fullagher, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Forbes Advocate </EMPHASIS>in my electorate on 23 April. He said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="909">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of the proposed goldmine at Lake Cowal is not an impediment to the lake being listed as a Ramsar wetland in the broadest technical sense. The minor intrusion of this mine well away from the waterbird habitat would not preclude its listing and it indicates a clear misunderstanding of the Ramsar convention principles to argue that the proposed mine would preclude the wetland being listed.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence was presented to the independent commission of inquiry which establishes that the proposed goldmine is unlikely to affect the special ecological values of Lake Cowal in either the short or long term. Environmental changes have occurred and are continuing to occur in and around Lake Cowal but still it retains its high conservation and ecological value.</PARA>
<PARA>No doubt he was referring to incidences like the 30 per cent of the time when the lake is totally dry and is farmed by farmers driving their tractors around the paddock. This would make more noise over a longer period of time than blasting&mdash;of course, driving a tractor around lasts longer than one second a day&mdash;and has had little or no impact on the birds breeding there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that sense will prevail and the Premier will look at these things again and take into account the fact that, if North Ltd is allowed to go ahead and develop their goldmine, they are prepared to spend $2 million on doing something about the rising water tables which are a problem because the water carries a lot of salt. Most of the experts say that within 10 or 20 years we will have a severe salinity problem in Lake Cowal. That, more than anything else, will destroy the lake as a bird breeding habitat. I hope the Premier will say that those benefits more than outweigh the detriment that Gabrielle Kibble refers to.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just when I thought I could not hear of anything more vacant&hyphen;minded than the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's planned cuts to the Australian Public Service, along comes Senator Vanstone with her blueprint now to wipe away some 12 per cent, or over $500 million, of Commonwealth funding to our universities in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand the thought processes going on inside the minds of the government's razor gang if these cuts are in fact to be undertaken. We are not talking about some stray $500 million here&mdash;a loose half a billion dollars tucked beneath some vice&hyphen;chancellor's academic gown. Let me make very clear to the members on the government benches in this House what we are really dealing with. I will speak slowly so that it will sink in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am really concerned that cutting funding to the extent now being mooted will cripple our universities irrevocably. Our students' education will suffer appallingly. The higher education industry, of which Australia is so justifiably proud, will fall into a penniless heap. Australian businesses and employers will no longer be able to bank on the fruits of a highly skilled work force&mdash;our universities will no longer produce enough people with the required skills to satisfy demand. The high international reputation of our universities will be tarnished forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Am I really getting through to the government benches? Do they really know what it is all about, Mr Speaker? Perhaps if I put it another way. I know that some of the government's members have university aged children of their own. Think of the extent to which they too will suffer. Think of when they come home and say, `I couldn't get into my lecture today because all the seats and the aisles of the theatre were full of students,' or `I can't study for my exam because all the books in the library's special reserve have been taken.' Think of how they will react when you do your little dance and glibly tell them to `send the bill to Beazley'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> by the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, Professor John Niland, who I understand is a great friend of the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), may help put some government members further in the picture. Professor Niland made the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="910"> point that higher education exports now generate more than $1.3 billion a year&mdash;comparable to our wheat exports which earn Australia $1.5 billion, and iron and steel which pulls in $1.4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Professor Niland, a 10 per cent cut in funding&mdash;not 12 per cent but 10 per cent&mdash;would reduce these exports by over $130 million. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Export earnings are passed on as increased spending and produce additional ripple effects. Regional economists estimate this multiplier to be approximately two. So that an initial fall in exports . . . of $130 million will translate into a reduction of national income of about $260 million. That corresponds to some 11,000 jobs and a loss in government tax revenue of around $55 million.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely when you look at figures like these, the government members opposite can see that cuts in this area will not save us anything&mdash;they will cost us dearly in monetary and in social terms. Cuts on such a scale are in fact self&hyphen;defeating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take a look at how many overseas students Australian universities cater for today. Think of the $1.8 billion they bring to Australia. Think of how the quality of their education will suffer and how it will affect our ability to market Australia's higher education system overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Really, do the `business gurus' opposite realise there are plenty of eager tertiary institutions in the UK, Canada and the US which are just itching to get a slice of the lucrative international education trade which Australia currently enjoys?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members should be aware that, as with the Public Service, the previous Labor government eliminated waste and inefficiency in higher education to Jack Sprat proportions. Commonwealth funding per student has fallen by 9.3 per cent in real terms over the past 12 years&mdash;there is no fat left from which to carve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition even criticised us for our reduction in funding. In its own policy statement it said that Labor's `significant per capita reduction of Commonwealth funds has had a detrimental effect on quality'. And they now want to cut $500 million more. From <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> your own logic, can I ask the members opposite me what they think this will achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone says that our universities should `sensibly realise the problem we are in, and sensibly work out how to get out of it'. I put it to her that cutting funding by 12 per cent does not make sense; it is in fact illogical in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel closer to my own electorate and the University of Western Sydney. We worked very hard over many years to get that up and running. It is a fine institute and it too will be affected by these cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister would do well to remember the recent point made by Professor Michael Osborne, Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Education is not cheap. It never has been cheap and if it is made cheap it will render our country cheap.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to mention a couple of examples of the difficulties that fathers are facing in relation both to child support and to access, examples that have come to my office recently. The first case involves a father who came to me. He has not seen his daughter for something like 18 months. He showed me a history of the accounts that he has had to pay to solicitors over a period of some five or six years. This chap is a storeman. He has outlaid something like $12,000 on attempts he has made to get access to his daughter. He gets an order for access, he gets orders of enforcement. The orders subsist for something like five months. They are complied with. At the end of that time they are then breached and he has to go back to court. This chap is an ordinary worker, he has outlaid something like $12,000 and he has not seen his daughter for something like 18 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what happens? He has the Child Support Agency on his back constantly. Having outlaid all of that money and having not had the proper support from the court structure to enforce those orders, he has the other arm of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="911"> the state after him for child support in those circumstances. That cannot be right, and something has to be done about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the other case, a gentleman came to my office and was shaking all over. I asked him what was the matter. He said: `I am getting more access to my children than the order specifies, so I sought a variation with the Child Support Agency in relation to maintenance.' The application for a variation was sent to his former wife. No response was made. So the variation was made. But about a month or so later, when the former wife responded to the variation, he found himself with an accumulated assessment of the order of $6,000. He was horrified at this. When he made some inquiries into it he found that his former wife did nothing other than supply a copy of the access order. In other words, the access order was relied on by the Child Support Agency to establish the fact of access. That is, the Child Support Agency accepted that the order was evidence of the access when in actual fact the real access that he was exercising was much greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there we have two examples of a system that is really out of control. I recall that when I was in practice at the bar, when an order was breached in relation to access in relation to an ex-nuptial child, an application for enforcement was taken to the Supreme Court. The judge said to the respondent: `I propose to give your former partner access this weekend. What do you say to that?' She said no. He replied by ordering that a writ of attachment be issued forthwith. That meant that by Friday evening of that night that person was in prison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Monday the judge phoned me and said: `I want that matter relisted.' She was brought up before the court. He said to her: `Do you intend to let your former partner have access to that child?' She said yes. She was immediately discharged and not another thing was ever done in relation to that matter. In other words, as I understand it, access was exercised properly and throughout. But the Family Court seems to be unable to come to terms with the fact that the power always lies in the person in control of the children. The non-custodial parent never has that power.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Family Court seems unable to recognise that and unable to enforce its orders. It has to be recognised that the court will never have respect in the community unless it enforces its orders properly and thoroughly. It ought to take the example that I outlined earlier of Mr Justice Connolly in the Supreme Court.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I spoke the week before last in the House about the terrible massacre at Port Arthur. As a result, some of the members of the House have approached me about how to make a contribution to the Port Arthur Victims Appeal. I have made some inquiries about the appeal, and I thought I would let the House know who will benefit and how the appeal will be conducted. The appeal has been established to provide financial support to the victims, the families of victims and the local community of Port Arthur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can you imagine what it is like to be suddenly without your wife, your husband or your child? They play a huge part in your life, and suddenly they are there no more. Clothes still need to be washed, lawns still need to be mowed and wood still needs to be cut. That simple support system that we all need and that we have all developed has suddenly disappeared. You cannot replace it, but you need to do something. What if you yourself had lost a hand or had been injured and temporarily incapacitated? You would need help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A management committee has been established to distribute the appeal funds based on a specific set of principles and guidelines and will consist of three qualified people who will be appointed by the Governor&hyphen;in&hyphen;Council. Beneficiaries of the fund will be the immediate families of the deceased victims, the injured and their immediate families, witnesses of the incident and their immediate families, the Port Arthur community and any other person the committee believes needs help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funds will be used for financial assistance for such things as immediate emergency costs arising from the incident such as funerals, transport costs of the deceased and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="912"> immediate families of interstate and overseas victims and the victims' families visiting the site. Also included are costs arising as a consequence of the incident which are not recoverable from elsewhere such as counselling for immediate families of overseas victims, any gaps or shortfalls in medical costs of injured victims, uninsured property that was destroyed or damaged, costs associated with personal and family hardship resulting from the incident and other associated costs which are not covered by existing government programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the appeal funds permit, the committee may establish a trust fund to support dependants, whether they be children, spouses, other relatives or other dependants of the victims. It may also consider the allocation of funds towards research into the prevention and management of and recovery from major traumatic incidents and provide for the establishment of a permanent memorial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appeal fund, as at 20 May, stands at over $2 million. There are many organisations that have responded in kind, whether it be additional assistance to the Tasman Council or the provision of accommodation and food for families of victims. If anyone would like to have further information about the committee overseeing the appeal or any more details, I have them in my office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People wishing to make a donation can do so through any Commonwealth Bank branch throughout the country or, if they wish, I can collect any crossed cheques made payable to the `Port Arthur Victims Appeal Account' and take them personally to the Tasmanian government on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also this week I have organised to have 20,000 more Port Arthur appeal stickers to be printed. This has been made possible by Tasmanian federal members of parliament from all political persuasions putting in a donation. More of these excellent locally designed stickers can now be circulated around Tasmania and the mainland which can result in raising another $40,000 towards the appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank all my Tasmanian colleagues for their help and enthusiasm for this project. I thank all those who have expressed their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> condolences and those who have offered their help. I know the Tasman community is grateful for the concern shown by so many people. The families and friends of the victims and all those who have been involved in helping them will gain a little comfort from the generosity of our nation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

While the member for Cowan and I share a belief that reliable research into learning disabilities is sadly lacking, I am advised by a constituent that US research suggests that as many as one in five unemployed youth academically and socially underperform because of a learning disability. These kids fail to fulfil their potential because their information processing, cognitive or sensory dysfunction is not addressed by the mainstream learning environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Learning disabilities are clearly a significant challenge for government, policy makers and parents, as well as the students themselves. When kids hit hurdles early in life, surely it is our duty to help to show them the way over or around or to guide them to achieve excellence in another field rather than risking them not participating at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My awareness of the plight of learning disabled kids was heightened by Ms Janette Lee and her son Trevor. Ms Lee is a resident of Langwarrin in Dunkley by the bay, and is coordinator of the local learning disabilities network. The network aims to improve the lives of children with learning disabilities. The group works towards raising the awareness of issues relating to learning disabilities, providing support and information and encouraging the full participation of children <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="913"> with learning difficulties, LD, in educational and recreational opportunities. The group sees its primary role as an educative one: to raise family, community and professional awareness of learning disabilities. I am sure that the group would be very pleased to see the discussion that we have had in this place today about the subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the states have primary constitutional responsibility for schools and special education, the Commonwealth continues to play a funding and leadership role. Under the national equity program for schools, the Commonwealth has a special education component which is described as a supplementary program only. It is unusual, to say the least, that this program specifically excludes the funding of students with learning disabilities. The Commonwealth provides funding of about $70 per head to help with the provision of services for students with disabilities, except for those primary and secondary students who have a learning difficulty. Kids with a learning disability miss out. Some states simply assume that the schools are addressing this issue through global funding allocations. The reality for one of my constituents is that she and her son have had to travel great distances in search of a school that has a supportive teaching practice and the educational environment to bring out the best in a student with a learning disability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hear the arguments that governments always have to draw a line in the sand somewhere, but it is clear to me that the problem of learning disabilities is increasingly becoming a mainstream issue and that our predecessors buried their heads in the sand over this issue. It is intriguing that, while learning disabilities are specifically excluded from the special education program funding available to primary and secondary schools, the issue is on the agenda of many universities and TAFE colleges. For example, assessment guidelines accommodate learning disabilities and take account of other aspects of educational achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the apparent correlation between students with learning disabilities in their formative years and academic and social underperformance in later years and into <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adulthood, I support the member for Cowan's call for a parliamentary inquiry. The increasing emphasis on investing in the early intervention and remedial action for literacy and numeracy underperformance is widely endorsed. We need to extend this approach to learning disabilities more generally via revised government policy settings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot let our kids down because, when it comes to letting them down today on learning disabilities, too many young people will end up being down on themselves for the rest of their lives. If children are inattentive, overly impulsive or hyperactive, some people might at first glance dismiss this behaviour as attention seeking. The National Health and Medical Research Council's 1990 report suggests that between 10 and 16 per cent of our children have learning disabilities. The problem cannot simply be dismissed as a ploy by children to attract attention. We need to be reliable and clear in diagnosis, creative about teaching practices, encouraging in the learning environment and able to inform parents and friends about appropriate supportive behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A parliamentary inquiry would be a constructive step in transforming community concern into improved government policy and better life outcomes for a significant group of people in our community.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Roads in Cranbourne North</TITLE>

<ELECTORATE> (Isaacs)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.50 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to draw the attention of the House to one specific issue of concern as it relates to the planning of roads in Cranbourne North&mdash;an important growth area within my electorate of Isaacs and located within the city of Casey, which is perhaps the fastest growing municipality in Australia and, indeed, firmly entrenched within the south&hyphen;eastern growth corridor, as it is euphemistically known. The city of Casey was, in fact, formerly known as the shire of Cranbourne prior to the amalgamation of municipalities in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This fast rate of growth in the city of Casey imposes significant responsibilities on planners to develop communities which meet the long-term interests and needs of residents. Of course, such planning must involve residents <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="914"> at the consultative level. I am concerned that in this particular instance this may not have been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1990, by way of some history, the then Victorian state government developed broad brush plans for proposed roads within the south-eastern growth area&mdash;and, specifically, within the area of Cranbourne North. Within these broad brush plans, there were no roads specifically named or designated, except to say that some, for example, were deemed to be subarterial, as in the specific instance of what is known currently as Golf Links Drive&mdash;a road to which I will turn shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently, in 1993 and 1994, home owners purchased homes at what one might call top dollar. These homes backed onto a golf course and undeveloped rural land and were purchased at top dollar for the privilege of the serenity and solitude that such an urban location bestowed. These homes were purchased largely through the agency of L. J. Hooker Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested now by the city of Casey, formerly the shire of Cranbourne, that in November 1993 the shire of Cranbourne circulated a notice to all residents who bought homes which backed onto the golf course and rural land. That notice advised that objections in regard to planning amendment L100 were sought. Planning amendment L100 proposed the construction of what ultimately will become a four-lane major arterial road adjacent to the quiet golf course and certainly running through the rural land which abuts the back fences of the residences in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No resident, at a public meeting I attended recently, attested to ever having received a notice offering the opportunity for objections to be submitted; and, indeed, no resident has ever personally approached me with the view that they had received any such notice. The first that residents became aware of this proposed road was in 1995 when they read about it in the Melbourne street directory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly perhaps, L. J. Hooker has since circulated these residents with a newsletter asking whether or not they want their homes to be sold. I believe that residents whose homes back onto the golf course and the proposed road, who paid top dollar for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> peace and quiet of the adjacent undeveloped land and who, in all likelihood, were not afforded the opportunity to object should not have a major road intrude into their neighbourhood, particularly given its detrimental impact on both the quality of life and property values in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of the above, I call on the city of Casey to initiate an amendment to the local planning scheme to downgrade the status of the proposed Golf Links Drive or, alternatively, purchase vacant land to the north of the area in question which is currently set aside for a quarry and re&hyphen;route this road to allow residents who were probably not afforded the opportunity to object the right to live the quality lives they sought by purchasing land in this particular area in the first instance.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to speak about the north&hyphen;south railway. Over the years there has been much discussion regarding the rail link continuation from South Australia via Alice Springs to Darwin. The railway would link the rest of Australia to the Northern Territory. It has been talked about for 86 years. The logic of the line is compelling, but until now construction proposals have not been so convincing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The freight levels are the single most important factor in determining the right time to build the railway. Since the Wran report, the ABS has significantly increased its estimates of domestic freight. Symonds Henderson has just completed a survey which shows the freight task to be even higher&mdash;1.787 million tonnes carried an average of 1,649 kilometres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This railway project is very important for the Australian community. It is not just a railway for the Northern Territory; it is a railway for the whole of the Australian community. It is not a pipe dream. I believe the information we now have on this project is convincing. I have a letter, which I will read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="915"> Minister for the Railway in the Northern Territory, Barry Coulter. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank for your letter of 1 April 1996 concerning the proposed Alice Springs&hyphen;Darwin railway. I look forward to our meeting on 2 May 1996 to discuss this matter further.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can confirm that the Government believes that the private sector is the key to the construction and operation of this new line and its policy is designed to facilitate a private sector investor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is prepared to provide the existing Tarcoola&hyphen;Alice Springs line free to a private sector developer prepared to build and operate an Alice Springs&hyphen;Darwin railway. To assist in this process, survey of the proposed track between Alice Springs and Darwin will be completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to taxation issue, I note that taxation incentives for investment in rail transport facilities are available to eligible projects through infrastructure borrowings. Any other tax issues raised with the Government would be a matter for further consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed by the minister. Not only is the Alice Springs to Tarcoola link important but the funding commitments by the South Australian and Northern Territory governments are also important. The South Australian government has said that it is prepared to put $100 million into this venture. The Northern Territory government is also prepared to put in funds. The Northern Territory government has spent some $75 million on upgrading the port facilities in Darwin. The finalisation of the corridor is also a very important factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see in the minister's letter that the government is going to finalise this corridor. The government has been talking to people in Korea and the United States and is hopeful that a financial package will be brought before the government for consideration. The railway does have a lot of community support. A survey on this matter was recently carried out in the Northern Territory. Over 80 per cent of territorians support the construction of the rail link from Alice Springs to Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very important factor that has been overlooked in previous discussions in regard to railway is the environment. I am led to believe that the railway will stop the emission of 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> annum and there will be a saving of some 2,000 million litres of fuel over a 50&hyphen;year period. We have to also take the defence factor into consideration. In my maiden speech, I made mention of the defence facilities in the Northern Territory. I also mentioned the fact that in 1995&hyphen;96 spending by the defence department exceeded some $54 million. I am aware that the defence department does support railway infrastructure being completed between Alice Springs and Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to consider the land bridge concept whereby cargo can be discharged in Darwin and freighted south to capital cities much quicker by rail than by sea. If cargo had to go from somewhere in the Timor Sea to Brisbane, Melbourne or Sydney there would be savings of many days if it was discharged in Darwin and freighted by rail rather than by sea. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important factor is that it will help expand the mining industry in the Northern Territory. In my maiden speech, I also referred to the fact that some 40 per cent of Australia's wealth is produced in the northern part of Australia. We believe that the rail link will certainly engender a lot more interest in the development of the mining industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
