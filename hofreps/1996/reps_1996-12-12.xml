<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994, the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1965, and to repeal the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965. The bill will also introduce minor technical amendments to the following portfolio acts to correct formal errors, omit a redundancy and fix misdescribed amendments: Dried Vine Fruits Equalisation Act 1978; Forestry and Timber Bureau Act 1930; Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989; and Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994, when enacted, will ensure that information provided by an active constituent company, at the request of the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals&mdash;otherwise known as NRA&mdash;is accorded the same level of compensatory protection as currently applies to information <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provided in respect of an agricultural or veterinary chemical product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This action is in response to concerns expressed by some companies involved with the marketing of active constituents. The active constituent compensation provisions, when enacted, will apply between the primary applicant with a protected active constituent and a secondary applicant seeking access to certain information relating to the protected active constituent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the proposed amendments will facilitate the generation of information about active constituents for the review program of active constituents and existing chemical products. That review program, in part, provides information for assessing the implications of active constituent residues in export commodities.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also a number of consequential amendments, including a decision made by the NRA to use protected active constituent information for certain approval purposes to be appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for merit review of that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendment to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 will prevent recipients of the drought relief payment (DRP) or their partners `double dipping' by receiving support in a couple&hyphen;rate payment under this act while at the same time obtaining payments or allowances identified separately under the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986. When DRP is calculated, an amount for the partner is included in the DRP payment. Hence, if the partner were to claim such a partner or parenting allowance in his or her own right, he or she would in effect receive the same support twice&mdash;once as a component of the DRP and again as a separate payment under the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Following this amendment such a case would not be possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 will extend the provision at subsection 79(2) of the act for wool industry funding to the Australian Animal Health Council by extending the sunset date from 30 June 1997 to 30 June 2000. The Australian Animal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Health Council is funded by contributions by the various animal industries. The Wool Council of Australia has sought, and supports, the amendment which extends this interim measure by extending the sunset clause of 30 June 1997. The Wool Council is considering alternatives for longer term funding and will advise its preferred position in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The repeal of the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965 is designed to facilitate the adjustment of the Australian tobacco industry towards international competitiveness. In July 1995, the activities of the Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee (ATMAC) were wound up in anticipation of the repeal of the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965 under which ATMAC operated. ATMAC was established primarily to recommend to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy the annual price and quantity for Australian tobacco leaf purchased by Australian cigarette manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been agreed by all the industry organisations which contributed to ATMAC funding that all rights, assets, obligations and liabilities held by ATMAC would be transferred to the Tobacco Research and Development Corporation (TRDC) at the time the act was repealed. I commend the bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill is a central plank of the package of bills to replace the Audit Act 1901. The other main bills in the package are the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1996 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996. Completing the package is the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8342"> Amendment Bill 1996, which will amend the multitude of other Commonwealth acts that connect with the Audit Act in a variety of ways. It provides the necessary formal machinery for the Commonwealth to make an orderly transition from its current, ageing and inadequate financial framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996 is designed to achieve a number of related purposes: foremost, the re&hyphen;establishment of the Office of the Auditor&hyphen;General of the Commonwealth of Australia, but in a way that both symbolically and practically strengthens the functional independence of the office beyond that available under current laws. The bill declares the Auditor&hyphen;General to be an `independent officer of the parliament', as an expression of the primary and unique relationship which the office has with the parliament. In keeping with the government's publicly stated commitment to confer genuine functional independence on the Auditor&hyphen;General, a range of statutory safeguards are included in the bill to prevent inappropriate influence being exerted on the Auditor-General by either the executive or the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill's other main purposes are to specify, clarify and broaden the powers and functions of the Auditor&hyphen;General as the external auditor of all Commonwealth bodies; to establish the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory agency; and to provide, in turn, for the independent audit of the Australian National Audit Office. Many of the provisions in this bill reflect the significant and valuable work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in pressing for a strengthening of the role of the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA, following its comprehensive 1988 inquiry into the operations of the Auditor&hyphen;General, produced report 296 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor&hyphen;General: Ally of the People and Parliament</EMPHASIS>. The committee recommended profound changes to the Auditor&hyphen;General's operations, including that the Audit Act be replaced with more modern legislation. Subsequently, the recommendations arising from JCPA reports 331 and 346 allowed further shape to be added to the bill as it now stands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I should mention that the government has accepted the proposition that the JCPA as sume the additional role of Audit Committee of the Parliament. Appropriate changes to the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 to that effect are included in the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996, and are complemented by provisions in the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now wish to provide an outline of the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill. In establishing the Office of Auditor&hyphen;General for the Commonwealth of Australia, the bill details the processes of appointment and conditions of the office. As a statutory office&hyphen;holder, the Auditor&hyphen;General will continue to be appointed by the Governor&hyphen;General on the recommendation of the appropriate minister&mdash;whom the administrative arrangements orders are expected to continue to specify as the Prime Minister. Under arrangements proposed in this bill, prior to advising the Governor&hyphen;General of the proposed appointee, that minister must seek the JCPA's endorsement to the proposal. That is, the parliament&mdash;through the JCPA&mdash;is to have the right of veto over the government's choice of Auditor&hyphen;General. The bill also retains the current safeguards for the removal of the Auditor&hyphen;General by the Governor&hyphen;General following a petition by both houses of the parliament in the same session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8343"> The Auditor&hyphen;General is to have a broad mandate enshrined in legislation, replacing the existing arrangements whereby the Auditor&hyphen;General's mandate is only partly derived from legislation and partly from government policy. The Auditor-General will have a mandate to audit the financial statements of, and conduct performance audits on, all Commonwealth bodies. For bodies that are government business enterprises, in recognition of the fact that they are subject to the overlaying accountability framework that requires them to pursue optimal market performance and to improve the return to the Commonwealth as shareholder, the Auditor&hyphen;General would not subject them to performance audits unless requested by parliament&mdash;through the JCPA&mdash;or a minister. If the body concerned is a partially privatised Commonwealth company, however, it would not be subjected to a performance audit. In this regard, the government has reflected on the need to continue the princi ple, as already accepted under the Audit Act 1901, of forbearance in consideration of the investment interests of private shareholders in such companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Performance audits are an extra feature on the accountability landscape peculiar to public sector bodies. It does not follow, however, that the often high parliamentary profile given the reports of such audits would always be beneficial to the interests of the companies' private investor/shareholders. To avoid the claim that, through imposing this extra tier of performance auditing, the Commonwealth was, thus, `oppressing' the minority private shareholders, the Auditor&hyphen;General's surveillance over the operations of partially privatised Commonwealth companies is to be exclusively as the mandated external auditor of their financial statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill seeks to permit the Auditor&hyphen;General to enter into an arrangement with any person or body to conduct financial statements audits or performance audits for them, or to provide them with services of a kind that are normally performed by auditors. These arrangements would be at the discretion of the Auditor&hyphen;General and be undertaken if it is within the Commonwealth's constitutional power to do so, and the Auditor&hyphen;General considers there is a benefit to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill seeks to establish the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority with exclusive functional responsibility to the Auditor&hyphen;General. The government sees the establishment of the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority as an important symbolic step to demonstrate our commitment to the functional independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The staff of the Australian National Audit Office are to be appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922, as a reflection of the fact that auditing the operations of the executive is a core service to the public through the parliament. Should the staff's existing skills and expertise need to be augmented from time to time, the bill also seeks to preserve the Auditor&hyphen;General's flexibility to engage any person&mdash;for example, to contract with auditors or other specialists from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the private sector&mdash;to assist in the performance of an Auditor&hyphen;General function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes that the Auditor&hyphen;General and authorised officials have full and free access to information and documents in the performance of mandated functions. These powers are considerable in their scope but are necessary if the Auditor&hyphen;General is to fulfil his or her obligations to the parliament. The information gathering powers are complemented with strong secrecy and penalty provisions for any person performing an Auditor&hyphen;General function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also seeks to re&hyphen;establish the Office of Independent Auditor who is the parliament's auditor of the Australian National Audit Office. It provides for the appointment and conditions of the office which, as far as are appropriate, mirror those of the Auditor&hyphen;General in relation to his or her audit functions for the balance of the Commonwealth. The Independent Auditor is to be a part&hyphen;time statutory officer appointed by the Governor&hyphen;General on the advice of the appropriate minister&mdash;again, this is expected to be the Prime Minister&mdash;with the JCPA having the same right of veto over the government's choice of nominee as it does in the selection of Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already indicated, the government has drawn heavily on the recommendations of the JCPA in framing this legislation. While the committee's recommendations have not been taken up in their entirety, the provisions of this bill and the complementary provisions in the other bills in the package provide the statutory environment in which the Auditor&hyphen;General&mdash;with all the professional and functional freedom required for the task&mdash;can fulfil, fearlessly and independently, the role demanded by parliament on behalf of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor&hyphen;General plays a vital role in giving credibility to Australia's system of parliamentary governance and this legislation will preserve and strengthen that role. I am pleased to present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill, together with the other two main bills that are part of this package&mdash;namely, the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996&mdash;will replace the Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before dealing with some of the details included in this bill, it is important to point out the boundaries of coverage over the Commonwealth's financial affairs that will be established by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act. In relation to financial administration, every Commonwealth body falls into one of two categories, according to the basic legal financial status that each body has. It either has the legal capacity, in its own right, by virtue of its incorporating legislation, to acquire ownership of money or other assets coming into its possession; or the body will function only as a financial and custodial agent for the legal entity that is the Commonwealth, without acquiring separate legal ownership of the money and assets it deals with on the Commonwealth's behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act is to apply to the operations of bodies that fall into the first category; that is, financially autonomous incorporated Commonwealth bodies that can acquire legal ownership of money in their own right. The proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is to apply to the second category of bodies that, financially, are agents of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This bill is concerned, therefore, with establishing the regulatory/accounting/accountability framework for dealing with and managing the money and property of the Commonwealth. It specifies responsibilities and powers necessary for the efficient, effec tive and ethical use of the resources lawfully available to the Commonwealth to carry out its programs; and it provides for appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the stewardship and management performance of those who are responsible for those resources can be made visible and, thereby, allow them to be held accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed law will provide a legislative framework for effective and accountable financial management that is not only matched to the public sector environment of today, but a framework that will also be flexible enough to meet the evolutionary changes to Commonwealth financial management practices that the future will inevitably bring. At the same time, the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is intended to preserve, clarify and strengthen the traditional strengths of the Audit Act's key principles of financial control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill deals comprehensively with its features. There are, however, a few elements that I would like to mention specifically. The definitions of `Agency', `Chief Executive', `official', `public money' and `public property' between them describe the proposed boundaries of the act's application. Within those boundaries, the principles set down in the act will be fleshed out, where necessary, by subsidiary legislation&mdash;regulations and Finance Minister's Orders&mdash;to provide procedural substance for the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day application of those principles. Such a legislative framework is patterned on the structure established by the Audit Act 1901 for regulations and finance directions, except that, unlike finance directions which are administrative in character, provision is made for Finance Minister's Orders to be tabled as disallowable instruments. The legislative framework will be completed by instructions which chief executives will be authorised to issue to officials of their agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act will preserve the role of the Minister for Finance as central to the orderly functioning of the Commonwealth's financial administration. The finance minister is, for all practical purposes, the custodian of the constitutional `Treasury of the Commonwealth', so <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8345"> that the range of statutory powers and responsibilities for the proper custody of the Commonwealth's money is vested in that office. The finance minister will retain the sole power to agree appropriate banking arrangements for public money, to make orders concerning the handling of receipts and withdrawals of public money, and as to its investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing power under the Audit Act 1901 to arrange overdrafts and advances from banks has been clarified to specifically limit such arrangements as short&hyphen;term cash management tools&mdash;overdrafts on operational bank accounts for up to 30 days; borrowings from banks as advances paid to the Commonwealth for up to 90 days; and other types of credit arrangements, to be prescribed by the regulations, such as those represented by credit card and cabcharge transactions, for up to 60 days. It should be noted that these arrangements confer no power for the Commonwealth to spend otherwise than as authorised by parliament through appropriations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most visible changes to be brought about by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is in relation to the accounting classifications of money in the Commonwealth's possession. The trust fund established by section 60 of the Audit Act 1901 is to be abolished and replaced by two purpose based funds&mdash;the reserved money fund and the commercial activities fund. Apart from components of the reserved money fund that may be established pursuant to other enactments, the components of these two funds will be established or varied by finance minister's determinations. The effect of such determinations will be to specify the kinds of money that may be drawn from the consolidated revenue fund or loan fund and credited to the particular component and the purposes on which that money may then be spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the spending of money from such a fund is, in all respects, an appropriation, the proposed act will require that these determinations by the finance minister be tabled as disallowable instruments that do not take effect until the period for disallowance has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> passed. This procedure is more visible and provides a greater measure of parliamentary control than has traditionally been the case in the establishment of trust accounts under the Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Payments of public money, including debiting a fund against an appropriation, will be controlled by a system of `drawing rights', to be issued by the finance minister. This system is predicated on the fact that the laws made by parliament relating to appropriations, variously compelling or permitting the executive government to spend, always specify the fund being appropriated and the purpose of the spending. Such laws may also specify an amount and a time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a breach of section 83 of the constitution for spending to occur in any instance outside of those parameters, so the act will stipulate that the finance minister has no capacity to issue valid drawing rights that are inconsistent with the terms of the relevant appropriation law; and makes it an indictable offence for an official or minister to knowingly spend, or seek to spend, otherwise than in accordance with a valid drawing right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act would put into the principal legislation the powers that are presently carried only in finance regulations in relation to providing a source of authority for the Presiding Officers to approve expenditure under appropriations for parliamentary departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present Audit Act 1901 is generally silent on matters of management performance. The new act seeks to remedy this through particular responsibilities being expressly placed on chief executives of agencies for which they may then be held accountable. They are to be required to manage the affairs of their agencies efficiently, effectively and ethically to the extent allowed by law. They will also be required to implement fraud control plans and establish audit committees. The accountability mechanisms to mesh with these responsibilities will include powers of the finance minister to obtain financial statements and other reports more frequently than annually from agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, it is proposed that chief executives be permitted to subdelegate to officials any of the act's finance minister's powers or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8346"> functions, unless the minister has imposed a restriction prohibiting or limiting such subdelegation. These arrangements for subdelegating are intended to achieve a major strengthening in the financial framework. Chief executives are better placed than the finance minister to manage, to monitor and to control the activities of those officials who perform the delegated tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will thus be practicable to hold chief executives accountable to the finance minister in these respects, whereas it is currently quite impracticable to do so under the existing Audit Act's delegation structures where thousands of individual officials are directly delegated by the finance minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposed law will be a lever for much&hyphen;needed change to sharpen and strengthen the framework of Commonwealth financial administration. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996 is one of the main bills in the package of legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901. The initial trigger for this bill is the necessity to replace part XI of the Audit Act which currently provides standard financial, reporting and auditing provisions for Commonwealth authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, only about two&hyphen;thirds of Commonwealth authorities rely on part XI of the Audit Act. The rest, instead, have their own financial, reporting and auditing provisions. Similarly, the memoranda and articles of association of wholly&hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies contain their own requirements in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so far as accountability to ministers is concerned. Consequently, at present, we have a myriad of variations on a similar theme scattered throughout the statute book and the constitutions of Commonwealth companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The underlying purpose of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act is to replace all of these diverse accountability requirements with a single set of core requirements. The approach proposed will enable the accountability requirements of Commonwealth controlled bodies to be viewed as a whole and should significantly streamline the focus of the government's and the parliament's interest in this area. Many of the bill's requirements relating to Commonwealth authorities are modelled on comparable areas of the Corporations Law as well as best practice currently applying to individual authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important feature of the bill is that it extends the mandate of the Auditor&hyphen;General to be the sole external auditor of all Commonwealth authorities and companies, and their subsidiaries. At the same time it will modernise the requirements for the Auditor&hyphen;General's reports on the financial statements of authorities and make them consistent with those required by the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will have become apparent from what I have already said that, in some areas, the bill traverses ground that is covered, to varying degrees, in the establishing legislation of authorities and the constitutional documents of companies. These areas of overlap will be removed by consequential amendments to the establishing legislation and are contained in the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996 which is part of this package of bills. Similarly, it is intended that areas of overlap in the memoranda and articles of association of Commonwealth companies be replaced with cross&hyphen;references to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the purposes of the bill, a `Commonwealth authority' is, in essence, one established by an act as a body corporate for a public purpose and which holds money on its own account. A `Commonwealth company' is one in which the Commonwealth has a direct <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8347"> controlling interest&mdash;that is, there is no interposed entity between the company and the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Commonwealth companies will be subject to the requirement for the Auditor&hyphen;General to report on their financial statements, and the financial statements of their subsidiaries, and for their annual reports to be tabled in the parliament. However, only `wholly&hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies' are to be subject to the other provisions in the bill relating to companies&mdash;those other provisions are essentially concerned with the furnishing of information to ministers and keeping them informed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This distinction between `wholly&hyphen;owned' and other Commonwealth companies reflects the difficulty&mdash;in the case of Commonwealth controlled companies which have private shareholders&mdash;of imposing a general regime which requires the provision of plans and reports only to ministers: namely, a risk of oppression actions by minority shareholders who might perceive discrimination against their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now briefly outline the main provisions of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. The annual report is seen as the centrepiece of directors' accountability to the parliament. The bill proposes that directors of Commonwealth authorities must prepare an annual report containing a report of operations, financial statements and a report by the Auditor&hyphen;General on the financial statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of operations and the financial statements must be prepared in accordance with Finance Minister's Orders; the directors and the Auditor&hyphen;General must certify whether, in their opinion, the financial statements give a `true and fair view' of the matters required to be reported. I should mention that the Finance Minister's Orders will be disallowable instruments, thereby ensuring an ongoing role for the parliament in determining the reporting obligations of directors of Commonwealth authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The directors of both Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies will be required to give the responsible minister a copy of their annual report which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the minister must, in turn, table in each house of the parliament. There are a number of other reporting obligations proposed by this bill which I will briefly mention. The finance minister may require Commonwealth authorities and wholly&hyphen;owned companies to prepare half&hyphen;yearly or quarterly reports. The reports must be given to the responsible minister within two months after the end of the period to which they relate and must be tabled in each house as soon as practicable. It is envisaged that this requirement to prepare interim reports will mainly be applied to bodies with a high degree of independence, such as government business enterprises. A body will formally acquire the status of a GBE by regulations made under the proposed act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Directors will be required to keep the responsible minister informed of the operations of Commonwealth authorities and wholly&hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies, including their subsidiaries, and to give the responsible minister and the finance minister such documents and information as they may require.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the finance minister requires such reports, documents and information, it is intended that, in the normal course, he or she will first consult with the responsible minister and provide a copy of such reports or documents to that minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly&hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies must also notify the responsible minister of certain proposed activities such as significant acquisitions or disposals of shares or businesses, changes in business activities or involvement in partnerships, trusts or joint ventures. However, the responsible minister may give written guidelines as to the coverage of the matters to be notified and may, in writing, exempt the directors from notifying particulars of proposals to form or participate in the formation of a company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Directors of a government business enterprise, whether constituted as an authority or a wholly&hyphen;owned company, must prepare a corporate plan at least once a year and give it to the responsible minister. This is a key planning document that will provide the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8348"> responsible minister with financial and other performance information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also contains a number of miscellaneous provisions relating to the governance of Commonwealth authorities and wholly&hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies. The bill proposes that the responsible minister may, after consulting with directors, notify them of general policies of the government that are capable of being applied to the authority or wholly&hyphen;owned company concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The directors must ensure that such policies are carried out and, as far as practicable, ensure that they are also carried out in relation to any subsidiaries. Such policies cannot be in conflict with any statutory obligations of a particular authority or company. I should emphasise that this provision does not confer on responsible ministers, or the government, a general power of direction as to how authorities and wholly&hyphen;owned companies are to carry out their particular functions. It is only intended to cover government policies that are applicable to the Commonwealth public sector in general, such as, for example, policies relating to trade contact with particular foreign countries or for the observance of equal employment opportunity policies, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides that directors must establish and maintain an audit committee. The government views this as a step in improving internal control and communication within Commonwealth authorities and wholly&hyphen;owned companies as well as sharpening the accountability of their management. It will also ensure that directors have appropriate assistance in the discharge of their accounting and financial reporting obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I will now mention briefly some of the provisions of the bill which only apply to Commonwealth authorities. Consistent with a recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its 1989 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Government companies and their reporting requirements</EMPHASIS>, the bill provides that a Commonwealth authority must ensure that none of its subsidiaries does anything that the authority itself does not have power to do. This does not, of course, preclude the parliament from passing legisla tion to empower a subsidiary to perform a particular activity that exceeds the powers of its parent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to maintaining the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act in ways that, as far as practicable, will keep it in harmony with comparable provisions of the Corporations Law, as they exist from time to time. The bill therefore imposes standards of conduct on officers of Commonwealth authorities that are the same as standards already imposed on officers of companies by the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill establishes a penalty regime modelled on the Corporations Law. Accordingly, a number of its provisions are identified as `civil penalty provisions', the breach of which may attract civil or criminal sanctions depending on whether the breach is accompanied by a dishonest intent. Contravention of these provisions may lead to the disqualification of directors from appointments to boards of Commonwealth authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The term `officer', as it is used in the provisions of the bill relating to Commonwealth authorities, is given the same meaning as it has in the equivalent provisions of the Corporations Law. Consequently, an `officer' is a director or any other person who is concerned in, or takes part in, the management of the authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides that a director of a Commonwealth authority who has an interest in a matter that is being considered, or about to be considered, by the board, must, as soon as possible after he or she becomes aware of the situation, disclose the nature of the interest concerned at a meeting of the board. The director must not participate in deliberations on the matter concerned unless the board or the responsible minister determines otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in accordance with another recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Government companies and their reporting requirements</EMPHASIS>, the bill provides that the responsible minister shall table in each house particulars of any new or varied direct Commonwealth interest in a company. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8349"> The particulars required are to be prescribed by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposals put forward in this bill will have no direct impact on government revenues or outlays. However, I am confident that, through the implementation of a more streamlined and consistent operational and accountability framework for Commonwealth authorities and companies, improved performance and value for money will be achieved both for the Commonwealth and Australians generally. I present the explanatory memorandum for the bill and commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill proposes the repeal of the Audit Act 1901 and deals with the transitional and consequential matters arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of proposed replacement legislation, namely, the Auditor&hyphen;General Act 1996, the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1996 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Audit Act 1901 is a pervading, operational act that gives flesh to certain basic constitutional requirements for the raising and spending of money by the Commonwealth; and, to that end, provides a procedural framework for day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day financial administration and audit across the whole spectrum of Commonwealth activities. Its repeal and replacement, therefore, has an extensive impact. This bill is intended to permit an orderly transition to the new framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extensive impact of replacing the Audit Act can be seen in schedule 2 to the bill&mdash;in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the proposed consequential amendments to the relevant provisions of the numerous other acts which refer in specific ways to the current Audit Act 1901. The proposed amendments will remove all such `Audit Act' references that occur in other legislation and replace them with provisions that appropriately link those acts to the framework of the new financial legislation. Schedule 2 of this bill also specifies consequential amendments to the enabling legislation of Commonwealth authorities so as to link those authorities to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also includes amendments to the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 to create a significantly enhanced role for the committee. These amendments flow from the government's acceptance of the proposition that the role of the Audit Committee of the Parliament be undertaken by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The committee's enabling act will be amended to reflect this new, additional role by expanding its listed statutory duties to strengthen, on behalf of the parliament, the relationship with the Auditor&hyphen;General and the Australian National Audit Office. The committee's responsibilities are now proposed to include consideration of the operations and resources of the ANAO and to report on matters arising out of those considerations; to examine the draft estimates of the ANAO and to make recommendations to both houses of the parliament and the responsible minister on those estimates; and to determine the audit priorities of the parliament and to advise the Auditor&hyphen;General of those priorities. The Public Accounts Committee Act will also be amended to reflect the committee's role, as provided for in the proposed Auditor&hyphen;General Act, in approving recommendations to the Governor&hyphen;General for appointments to the Office of Auditor&hyphen;General and that of Independent Auditor of the ANAO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a procedural level across the range of Commonwealth financial administration, the transitional matters provided for in this bill include the formal transfer, as appropriations, of balances from the Audit Act's existing fund accounting structure to the new structure <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8350"> established by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act 1996; the continuation of the appointment of the Auditor&hyphen;General in office as at 30 June 1997 for a period not exceeding 10 years from the date of his appointment&mdash;in 1995&mdash;under the Audit Act; the continuation of the existing arrangements for the position of Independent Auditor as auditor of the ANAO; the continuation for the time being&mdash;until regulations under the replacement legislation come into effective operation&mdash;of the current safeguards, as agreed by parliament, under section 70D of the Audit Act, in relation to the nature of audit and financial reporting disclosures for the security and intelligence agencies; and for regulations to be made to cover a range of situations, at a procedural level, that might need to demonstrate legal certainty to support their smooth transition to the new legislative framework&mdash;for example, for the continuation of the myriad contractual and other arrangements entered into under the authority of the repealed act, such as operating bank accounts, contracts, audits in progress, debtors' repayments by instalments, et cetera.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 amends a number of acts coming within the Attorney-General's portfolio. It also amends two acts within the responsibilities of the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature, makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation and repeals a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> spent provision. The amendments are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the bill. The amendments will not have any significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 will establish a Small Taxation Claims Tribunal within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, AAT. Rather than creating a separate structure, the Taxation Appeals Division of the AAT will be known as the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal when it is exercising powers under the new part IIIAA of the AAT act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is intended that the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal will provide a cheaper and more informal means of resolving disputes between the small taxpayer and the Commissioner of Taxation. There will be an emphasis on mediation as a form of dispute resolution. As part of the current AAT structure, the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal will also be able to draw on the resources and expertise of the Taxation Appeals Division. All of the powers of the AAT and the Taxation Appeals Division will be able to be exercised by the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amount of tax in dispute, which will determine whether an application for review of a taxation objection decision can be heard in accordance with the new part IIIAA, will be $5,000, unless a higher amount is set some time in the future by the regulations. Applications for review of a taxation objection decision will have to involve less than the determined amount in order to be heard by the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. It is intended that the non-refundable filing fee for small claims matters will be $50, but the tribunal will be able to waive this fee in cases of hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will make a procedural amendment to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 arising from advances in technology. There are now films that provide what is known as `click-on' access to a range of viewing options. This can make classification difficult as the classifier cannot be sure that all of the viewing options available have been accessed for classification purposes. The amendment will put the onus on the applicant to inform the Classification <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8351"> Board of the presence of any contentious material in the film. Failure to do so will, if this material comes to light after classification, result in the film being automatically declassified if the material would have led to the film receiving a different classification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also amend the act to align with the amended criterion in the national classification code the criterion for refusal to approve an advertisement under the act on the grounds that it contains child pornography. Commonwealth, state and territory censorship ministers have amended the code to tighten the child pornography criterion to make it easier to deal with material where it is difficult to determine the age of the person portrayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 will allow a member of the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal to receive remuneration as a member of the tribunal in accordance with the act while concurrently holding judicial office or the office of magistrate, provided that office is remunerated on a part-time basis. The bill will also correct drafting amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also make some minor amendments to the Evidence Act 1995. One of the amendments will extend the operation of a certificate given under section 128 of the New South Wales Evidence Act. Such a certificate gives a witness use and derivative use immunity in respect of self-incriminating evidence given in any New South Wales court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other amendments will correct drafting and minor technical errors in the Evidence Act and its explanatory notes, achieve total consistency in drafting expression between that act and the New South Wales Evidence Act and insert further explanatory notes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also make a number of drafting and technical amendments to the Family Law Act 1975, consequential upon the amendments made by the Family Law Reform Act 1995. The previously existing jurisdiction of magistrates courts in defended child maintenance matters will be restored. The amendments will clarify the relationship between parenting plans under the Family Law Act and child support agreements under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, making it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clear that one document can be used for both purposes. Technical anomalies will be corrected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, two new matters will be added to the particular matters about which rules of court may be made by the judges of the Family Court of Australia. The addition of trial management will allow the making of rules of court that will further advance the simplification of procedures and provide greater certainty about procedural aspects of trials. The addition of conciliation conferences to this provision will provide a clear power to make the rules that provide for conciliation conferences. Such conferences are an important aspect of assisting parties where appropriate to resolve their disputes without requiring a judicial determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also make a number of minor policy amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. The court will be able to appoint marshals for the purposes of the Admiralty Act 1988 as officers of the court. Currently appeals can be brought to the Federal Court from the Supreme Court of the ACT when it is known as the Court of Disputed Elections. The stated intention of the ACT legislature is that there be no appeal from the Court of Disputed Elections. The bill will provide that an appeal to the Federal Court cannot be brought from the Supreme Court of the ACT when it is known as the Court of Disputed Elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act provides that the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions may bring a reference appeal on a question of law arising in a trial in the Supreme Court to the Federal Court. This has been interpreted to mean that only the Commonwealth Attorney-General and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions may bring these appeals. The bill will ensure that reference appeals can also be brought by the ACT Attorney-General and the ACT Director of Public Prosecutions. The bill will also provide that reports of reference appeals may in certain circumstances be published.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 will provide a mechanism for establishing an applicable rate of exchange in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8352"> relation to the registration of foreign judgments. The amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 will make provision specifying the method of conversion of New Zealand currency into Australian currency with respect to the enforcement of certain New Zealand judgments. The amendments to the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 will make provision specifying the method of conversion of foreign currency into Australian currency with respect to the enforcement of certain foreign judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The day on which the rate of exchange is to be established will also be changed. Currently it is the day of the application for registration of the judgment. It will be the second business day before the day on which the application for registration of the judgment is made. This is necessary to enable the judgment creditor time to obtain the necessary evidence from authorised foreign exchange dealers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Judges' Pensions Act 1968 will be amended to provide that a retired federal judge is entitled to receive the federal judicial pension and hold judicial office in relation to a territory, provided that the judicial office is not remunerated on a full-time basis. The Judiciary Act 1903 will be amended to provide the Federal Court with jurisdiction under sections 75 and 76 of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently clients of the Australian Government Solicitor, when successful parties to proceedings in all courts, are entitled to recover party&hyphen;party costs. The Judiciary Act 1903 will also be amended to allow for the recovery of costs in Federal Court proceedings by successful parties represented by state or territory government lawyers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 will be amended to provide that the act will apply to the Australian Capital Territory on the same basis as it applies to the states and the Northern Territory. The Privacy Act 1988 will be amended to give the Privacy Commissioner the power to determine that an agency is to be a credit provider for the purposes of the act. This amendment is intended to deal with the situation where an agency provides credit on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 will also allow a credit reporting agency to list an overdue payment under a guarantee on the guarantor's credit information file. This will only be permitted where the credit provider has first satisfied several conditions, including notifying the guarantor and allowing him or her a 60&hyphen;day period to make the payment, as well as taking steps to recover the amount of the payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this purpose, the bill also inserts in the act a definition of the term `guarantee' and a transitional provision to ensure that the amendment does not operate retrospectively. The amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 will clarify the Privacy Commissioner's powers in relation to the copying and retention of documents produced to him or her under section 44 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will make some amendments to the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992. None of the amendments will make any significant policy change. The states and territories were consulted about all the amendments. Two amendments will correct drafting omissions. Two of the amendments will take account of changes in state practices by providing for the use of bail justices in Victoria and by allowing sheriff's officers and bailiffs of prescribed states to execute interstate warrants of apprehension for the enforcement of lower court fines. The other amendments will:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> align the period for entering an appearance to an originating process served interstate more closely with the period applying when an originating process is served within the state of issue;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> simplify the procedures applying in some cases when a person who is under a restraint on his or her movements is arrested under an interstate warrant; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provide for the situation where a person, in the course of his or her transfer in custody intrastate, is taken into another state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to the Superannuation Act 1976 will widen the pool of Administrative Appeals Tribunal members who are eligible to hear applications for review of decisions made under the Superannuation Act 1976. It <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8353"> will extend the requirement that at least one member hearing an application for review be an eligible member or pensioner under the 1976 scheme to include a member who is a member or pensioner of the scheme established under the Superannuation Act 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Taxation Administration Act 1953 will be amended consequentially upon the establishment of the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. The amendments will also provide that the hearings of taxation matters in the AAT will be in private where a taxpayer so requests, except if the matter is being heard in the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. In small taxation claims matters, the normal AAT provisions will apply, so that a hearing will be in public unless the tribunal is satisfied that it should be in private.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 will correct a minor drafting error and the amendment to the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1983 will repeal a spent provision.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to make a few remarks on the proposals to do work in the Old Parliament House. It is commendable that the current government is continuing the decisions of the previous government to ensure that the Old Parliament House becomes <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> restored to the way it was in the 1920s and the 1930s, so that it becomes a very good constitutional museum and parliamentary museum here in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> When people go to other parts of the world, they often see very good examples of the constitutional history of a country which allows people to partake themselves&mdash;to go into the chambers and to have the access that you do not have in this building, which is a working parliament. For those of us who have served in the old parliament and have fond memories of the place, to see the building open to the public the way it is now is a very good thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The worry I have is that the government now seems to want to change things down there quite considerably. In the last day or so, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) advised us that they are going to start to vandalise the old chamber by bringing up the Speaker's chair from that chamber. The chair is very much in keeping with the ornate style of that chamber and very out of keeping with the style of this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested that the government is going to spend between $300,000 and $500,000 to move the chair up here. The government was telling people yesterday that those receiving meals on wheels will have to pay $30 a week more. It would seem an absolutely disgraceful waste of public money to spend nearly half a million dollars ripping the chair out of the middle of Old Parliament House and bringing it up here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also some symbolism problems that I think we should take into account in doing that as well. As members might recall, the old chair is a very ornate piece of work. It has a lot of attributes that would make it look out of place in this chamber. The old chamber was a closed&hyphen;in type of chamber; this is a very open chamber. To have the Speaker sitting up in a chair that has a canopy over it, looking like he or she was in a cubbyhole&mdash;which is what it would look like in this building&mdash;I think would look aesthetically ridiculous in this chamber.</PARA>

There is a lot of poignancy in the fact that the same day the government gets up and announces that it wants to spend about half a million dollars bringing this piece of furniture up here the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) tells the House that pensioners who earn less than $200 a week for the single pension will, in her words, `make a modest contribution of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an extra $30 a week to get meals on wheels'.

A hole will have to be knocked in the wall to get the chair out and the doors of this building will have to be taken off to put the chair in here. Later on the government will probably have to pay for a replica to go down into the old chamber&mdash;and that would cost more money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am opposed to this proposal on the basis of cost. To have the old chair up here with the Speakers looking like they are sitting in a cubbyhole crouched in the back of the room would make this chamber look ridiculous, and it certainly would not fit in with the style of this building.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4I4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just getting on to that. We are talking about the redevelopment of the opposition party room. That was the room where the Government Whip, who is going to speak after me, got up and rammed these silly motions in the old parliament about why we should have the chair moved up here. The member for Warringah's close friend and predecessor was the person who got up in that opposition party room and ran the argument in those days to bring the chair up here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this debate about what we should do with the Speaker's chair in the House of Representatives was canvassed quite considerably in that historic opposition party room which has now been refurbished. That is where this silly debate first started. There is a great symmetry in this argument here before us today about the excesses of the former member for Warringah and the excesses of the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8355"> in the old opposition party room down there when they first began this plan to have the House of Representatives chamber here dominated by the crest of the British monarch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government now want to reinsert those ideas of domination into this House let them stand up and say so but let us not do this by stealth. What happened in that opposition party room was that the debate was won and lost down there and it should have stayed down there. It should not be brought up here now, nearly 10 years after we have moved into this building. We most certainly should not have this massive waste of public money&mdash;half a million dollars or so to move it up here and then more money for a replica.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a little bit interesting to know why the government want to bring up only the Speaker's chair; why in that debate they had in the opposition party room was there never any discussion about bringing up the President's chair? I do not know whether the reason for that could be that the President's chair was given to us by the Canadian parliament&mdash;and those opposite are not all that interested in the Canadians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the House of Representatives Speaker's chair was given to Australia by a now defunct body. What was that body? When you work out why the English monarch's crest is on it, it makes you twig what the body was: it was the Dominion Parliamentary Association, a body that does not exist any more. The Dominion Parliamentary Association was made up of all those little unfree countries that finally got away from the motherland and became the Commonwealth. That chair has a little sign on it saying it was given to us by the 1,200&hyphen;odd parliamentarians who made up&mdash;I am sorry, it was not the Dominion; I was wrong. It was worse! It was the Empire Parliamentary Association and it was not even the poor old Dominion that gave it to us; it was the United Kingdom branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Warringah will love that even more because we have come full circle and we will bring the Empire back up here into the House of Representatives chamber and we will have the crest of the British <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> monarch, representing the Empire, staring down at us every day. This is really back to the future; this is mad stuff. Not only that, but in these times of financial stringency, we are going to waste half a million dollars to bring the Empire back and have the monarch's crest dominate this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never heard of anything more ridiculous in the many years I have been in this parliament. We argued this down there and the debate should stay down in the old House as part of its history; the chair should stay down in the old House as part of its history; and the people on the government side who are so in love with the Empire should try to get themselves back into the 20th century and fall in love with Australia. That is what we should be doing.</PARA>

I regret to say that I am now very familiar with the opposition party room in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that it is proposed to demolish the press gallery additions at the Old Parliament House. I can well remember, as a new member in the old parliament, trying to get across from the Senate side to the House of Representatives side via the parliamentary press gallery. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, it was an absolute rabbit warren. I made several attempts but I got completely lost and ended up very frustrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I think that all members of parliament, particularly those who had the privilege of serving in the Old Parliament House, have a concern about what is happening to it. I think we would all agree that there need to be improvements. I note that the additional accommodation provided for members in 1984&mdash;which, on my understanding, was to be for new members but was purloined by existing members&mdash;has not been demolished to date. I wanted to bring that to your atten tion, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the hope that you might raise with the Speaker the concerns that I and other members have about that very functional but temporary accommodation still being in existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the rooms I refer to occupy part of the House of Representatives gardens and stick out like a sore thumb.

It is not that which drags people here, but it is something to which they go when they come, and I welcome that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to briefly comment on the fact that I support this because it is just about the only piece of capital works expenditure which this government is supporting in the ACT. We are in a situation here in Canberra where for the first time since 1982 the unemployment level is above the national average. There is a certain symmetry in that of course because that was also a period when John Howard was responsible for the economy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of facilities for 5 Aviation Regiment at RAAF Base Townsville.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal seeks approval for the Townsville army aviation works project. The 5 Aviation Regiment provides air mobility, medium lift and aerial fire support to army units. Its main customer is 3rd Brigade located at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville, which provides a ready deployment force for the ADF through air mobile, air portable operations. Under restructuring, the Australian Army's 5 Aviation Regiment will continue to be based at RAAF base Townsville to provide helicopter support to land force units located in northern Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the introduction of the Black Hawk, unexpected corrosion has been identified in the helicopters based at 5 Aviation Regiment. The level of corrosion is such that maintenance costs associated with corrosion are expected to exceed sustainable funding levels. In addition, the capacity to operate the helicopters through to life of type is diminished. To ensure that the Black Hawk can be operated through to life of type, the Department of Defence has instigated a corrosion control program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To support the corrosion control program, it is proposed to construct a number of additional facilities at 5 Aviation Regiment. These facilities will reduce corrosion caused by operation and storage of the helicopters in the humid, salt laden atmospheric conditions and will include helicopter environmental protection shelters, a helicopter wash facility and dehumidification equipment for Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters. Degradation of the helicopters from high temperatures and ultraviolet radiation will also be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing 5 Aviation Regiment transport compound and some technical workshop facilities are inappropriately located remote from the 5 Aviation Regiment precinct. The facilities are inadequate and their locations present an ongoing cost to unit efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8359"> The works proposed include the construction of a purpose built transport compound and workshop complex for vehicle maintenance and general engineering. Other ancillary works to correct existing deficiencies at 5 Aviation Regiment include the relocation of the small arms repair section and the refur bishment of the gunship helicopter loading point known as ordnance loading area No. 6.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subject to parliamentary approval, works are planned to commence in March 1997 with construction to be completed by December 1998. The preliminary estimate for the proposed construction works is $19.1 million at December 1996 prices. The outturn cost is $21.332 million. The Public Works Committee in its report tabled on 11 December concluded in part that the proposed environmental protection shelters, the provision of dehumidification equipment and the helicopter wash facility can be justified as providing the necessary facilities for the successful and economic implementation of the corrosion control plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scope of works for the transport compound and workshop facilities can be justified on the basis of considerably improved working conditions and improved shelter and security for the extensive fleet of vehicles, resulting in improved efficiency. The extent of proposed ancillary work will improve the small arms repair section and ordinance loading aprons. The committee recommends the development of facilities for 5 Aviation Regiment at RAAF Base Townsville at an outturn cost of $21.332 million. I would like to thank the committee for their support and I commend the motion to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sore point with me for two reasons. The ministerial statement on restructuring was very brief and gave few details.

I am not coming at it as someone who is opposed to Army 21.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am really interested to know whether the minister can assure the House that the Public Works Committee has been adequately briefed on the restructure of the army.

If the minister cannot provide that assurance to the House, how then can he move this motion?

Secondly, of development options examined, the preferred option is the provision of infrastructure to support training at brigade level which will allow the range to be developed close to its maximum potential and provide training benefits within a realistic time frame and at realistic costs. Thirdly, the extent of the proposed development can be justified on the grounds of public safety, effective management and maximum use of the range in accordance with the user requirements and concepts for manoeuvre operations. Fourthly, the committee supports the use of army engineers on elements of the project which would provide training benefits and not directly compete with the private sector. Fifthly, design standards will conform with relevant codes, statutes and operational manuals and procedures, Sixthly, the committee recommends the development of infrastructure on the Townsville field training area at an estimated outturn cost of $18.694 million. I would like to thank the committee for their support and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>These are amendments to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 made by the Senate last night. The Senate made 17 amendments which have been circulated to honourable members this morning. These amendments in effect make six key policy changes <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the bill as proposed by the government in the Senate. I will detail the government's position. Fundamentally, the government will accept all of the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 1 relates to the commencement provisions for the bill. Clause 2 of the bill as introduced provided for commencement on royal assent, with the exception of item 25 of schedule 1 of the bill, which would commence on the first day after the minority interest sale time. Amendment No. 1 substitutes a new clause 2, which provides for, firstly, the amendments to the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 to commence on 1 May 1997 and, secondly, the amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991 to commence on royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The later commencement for the amendments to the Telstra Corporation Act will ensure that they do not commence until after the Senate Economics Legislation Committee has reported on the matter of public equity in Telstra Corporation Ltd, with particular reference to the suitability of redeemable preference shares or other capital raising options for public participation by way of investment in Telstra. New clause 2 also removes the special commencement provisions in clause 2 of the bill in relation to item 25 of schedule 1. This amendment is consequential on the removal of item 25 of schedule 1 in Senate amendment No. 17.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment Nos 2 to 5, 7 to 10, 12 and 14 to 16 have the effect of extending the new customer service guarantee from carriers to all service providers, which we talked about the other day in the House. Amendment No. 6 will extend the range of matters about which Austel can make performance standards for the purposes of the customer service guarantee to include other matters in relation to which Austel thinks it appropriate to develop standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 11 increases the proposed statutory cap for damages payable under the customer service guarantee from $3,000 to $25,000. Amendment No. 13 makes a minor technical change to ensure that the power to issue evidentiary certificates in clause 87H does not affect the right of a customer to complain to the Telecommunications Industry <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8362"> Ombudsman about a breach of a performance standard under the customer service guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 17 relates to the proposed removal of the directions power in section 9 of the Telstra Corporation Act. Item 25 of schedule 1 of the bill as introduced omitted section 9 of the Telstra Corporation Act which enables the minister, after consulting with the board, to issue directions to Telstra in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 17, the last one, omits item 25 of schedule 1 of the bill, thereby retaining the power of the direction in section 9 of the Telstra Corporation Act. This statutory power has never been exercised. It is the government's expectation that any public interest controls would be exercised through regulatory mechanisms which apply to all carriers and that, if the Commonwealth sought to exercise any control over Telstra in its capacity as a shareholder, it would do so by exercising the rights attaching to the two-thirds of the shares which it owned not by exercising the power of direction. As I mentioned at the commencement of remarks, the government is prepared to accept the amendments made by the Senate and hopes for speedy passage in this place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Werriwa)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.13 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party will be supporting each of the 17 amendments made by the Senate. In particular, we were pleased that amendment No. 17 was carried in the Senate and we are pleased to support it in the House of Representatives. As the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) has just mentioned, amendment No. 17 relates to the power to give ministerial directives to the board of Telstra. The Labor Party sees that power as an essential third tier in the safety net, guarding public interest concerns about the operation of Telstra&mdash;particularly with regard to regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first tier of the safety net for regional Australia is public ownership. One of the very sad aspects of the government's decision to privatise one-third of Telstra is that the people of Australia are losing their full public ownership of the great telecommunications company of this land. Nothing is sadder than the loss <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of public ownership of the infrastructure for the information superhighway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one aspect of Telstra that should absolutely be held in public hands, it is the cables and the pipes of Telstra, because they are the essential infrastructure for the information superhighway. As our society moves more and more towards an information society, it is essential that public ownership of the pipes and cables be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second tier of the safety net for regional Australia is section 183, something that was used effectively, interpreted as such by the former minister, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). The interpretation of the new government has changed, because they are reading section 183 in tandem with section 185. Two days ago the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, in the MPI debate, said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . section 183 fundamentally says there shall not be a price discrimination except in certain circumstances under the exemptions, and 185A is one of the exemptions&mdash;that is, where a carrier can show that there are cost justification reasons for doing so. Quite clearly, it costs a lot more to provide call systems in remote or regional areas than it does in some closely populated urban areas, and that is why the exemption is there.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement of laissez&hyphen;faire. That is a statement of the government's determination to see Telstra operate according to solely commercial grounds in private ownership and disregard the universal service obligations that have been put in place to protect regional Australia and regional telephone consumers. In tandem with the government's determination, initially, to abolish the ministerial directives, the Howard government was wiping out each of the three tiers of the safety net for regional Australia in telecommunications: public ownership&mdash;gone; 183&mdash;reinterpreted to read as a charter for laissez&hyphen;faire operations for Telstra; and ministerial directives&mdash;gone. Each of the three tiers of the safety net, carefully constructed by the former Labor government, was going to be abolished by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of the terrible decision of the Senate and the terrible sell&hyphen;out by the Independent senators in that place, one thing at least has been salvaged; that is, the third tier of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8363"> safety net&mdash;the ministerial directives and how they will need to be applied under the new ownership arrangements for Telstra. As this government moves towards the commercial charter, those ministerial directives will need to be applied to safeguard the public interest, to safeguard the idea of universal service provision in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all understand how there is pressure now for a differential local call rate in Australia. Optus have moved to the 20c local call in the elite affluent parts of Sydney, and is planning to do so for the same types of suburbs in Melbourne. But under this government that is not an opportunity which will be made available to regional Australia. This government is basically saying that the policy guideline for adoption is user pays. If there is an extra cost for regional Australia, a cost not experienced on the north shore of Sydney, then that cost for regional Australia should be covered with a user&hyphen;pays philosophy. That is a shameful reversal of the principles of universal service obligation and access that the former government had in place. The ministerial directives need to be maintained. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by thanking my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) for outlining the opposition's position on our attitude in supporting all of the 17 amendments. I will confine my remarks to amendment No. 17, which blocks the government's attempts to delete the minister's ability to issue a direction to Telstra. I place on record my appreciation to Senator Harradine and Senator Colston for supporting the opposition's amendment in the Senate. We think this is a very crucial power for the minister for communications to have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I am not a lawyer&mdash;I am an engineer&mdash;but I do know that when judges have to make decisions on legislation that is passed by the parliament, they sometimes take account of what ministers say. Given the fact that this minister, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), and this government have tried to frustrate our at tempts to retain that power of direction in the hands of the minister, I hope that any judge that is making a future decision about the legality of these issues will take account of the views not just of the government and this minister but also of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government is at the dispatch box this morning accepting this amendment means that their party and their government is accepting that the minister for communications will retain that right, that power of direction. There is no point in the minister for sport trying to use some weasel words&mdash;as he did in his earlier remarks this morning&mdash;by saying that in some way the government is only going to be entitled to the rights that they are entitled to as the owners of certain shares in the company. Minister, there is no point in trying to use your words in this debate to in some way undermine the amendment that you are accepting. What this amendment does is give the minister for communications the power to issue a direction to Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we had not been successful in the Senate, the minister for communications could not have issued directions, because that would have been oppressing the minority shareholders. Even though the government has two-thirds of the shares, you cannot oppress the minority shareholders. If this government allows Telstra&mdash;whether it is one-third privatised or not&mdash;to take certain decisions, here are a few examples where we would be calling on the minister to use that power of direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Telstra tried to introduce charging for directory assistance, that would be a breach of the undertakings given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this chamber earlier this year. We would be in here calling as loudly as we could for the government to issue a directive to Telstra to stop the introduction of such charges. If the power of direction were not there, the public could not rely on the government to use its two&hyphen;third shares to ensure that there would be no charge for directory assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second example is the one we have been talking about this week. If there were an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8364"> attempt to introduce differential local call charges across the country, we would demand that the minister issue a directive to Telstra. After 1 July 1997, under the government's new legislative regime, if the government does away with section 183 in the act that prohibits discriminatory pricing, and if the government tried to allow Telstra to drop the price of local calls only in the suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne where Optus is competing, we think that would be against the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it would be wrong for the people who live in the other suburbs of Sydney to also not get access to a 20c local call. It would be wrong for them to be paying 25c if the residents of Chatswood, Hunters Hill and other places in the Prime Minister's electorate were to get 20c local call rates. It would be wrong for the residents of Launceston, in the minister's own electorate, to keep paying 25c if Telstra customers in the affluent suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne had the benefit of that lower charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are just two examples of why we think it is imperative that even a part&hyphen;privatised Telstra operates in a regime where the minister for communications retains the power to direct. The minister can only use that directive after he follows certain procedures, so the minister has to be accountable to this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make is that, in accepting these amendments, the government are accepting that they are going to have this responsibility in future years. There is no point in the minister in his contribution today trying to argue in some way that the power of the minister is limited to the power of the representative shareholder who owns that two-thirds share. That is something I would appreciate the minister conceding in his future remarks in this debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I had really not wanted to be drawn out on that, but in spite of that. I think you have to understand that, when you are privatising a minority shareholding, a third, effectively what you are doing is handing control of the company to that one-third owner, as we are proposing to do, with the Commonwealth having control over the remaining two-thirds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your directors get locked up into fiduciary responsibilities so that you have this conflict between the Commonwealth having a responsibility to ensure that services are provided comprehensively and adequately and their role as a shareholder. Then you find that the Commonwealth cannot exercise it because directors argue that they have a fiduciary responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is probably one of the most crucial amendments that has been made. The position of the opposition is that we oppose the sale of Telstra. We see Telstra as providing a most important infrastructure to all Australians. We want it provided equally so that there is an equity of access and a universality of access. We do not want it defined as the ordinary service or POTS&mdash;plain old telephone service&mdash;if I can use that terminology that was developed some time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this power is doing is saying that, notwithstanding the partial privatisation, the minister for communications and his representative in this place are going to have certain responsibilities. He cannot mince in here saying, `Look, I would like to help the bush, I would like to help rural and regional people or I would like to help the urban poor and make sure that they have access to the means of delivering the superhighway, but I can't. My hands are tied. This is a partially privatised entity. It's market forces that will dictate the situation, and if there ain't a profit in rural Australia, if there ain't a profit in regional Australia, tough.' The opposition and the Senate have insisted on a degree of ministerial accountability by the minister representing the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8365"> minister for communications in this chamber and, of course, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston bleated this morning that this has probably diminished some of the sale price, and so it should. We should not be in this situation at all. But he is not going to be able to mince in here saying, `I don't have the power.' This House of Representatives, this opposition, has sought quite clearly to ensure&mdash;and the Labor Party sought to ensure&mdash;that he had this power of direction so that you would not get differential pricing and differential services throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not opposing these amendments; in fact, we are supporting them. But we want to place on the public record that we are going to be holding the government accountable and, if you fail to exercise your ministerial duties that you have to all Australians, we will be in this place reminding you that you have the power. It was given to you by this House and the Senate with the support of the opposition. Unquestionably you will have the power so that there will not be differential benefits derived, for example, in the area of local calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have raised the issue of fiduciary responsibility before with the minister when this matter was being debated some time ago.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not surprise me that the member for Dobell should take a point of order because this cuts right to the heart. The member for Dobell realises that this is yet another example of the tentacles of the Left infiltrating the fair and forthright tentacles of the Right within the Labor Party&mdash;those tentacles that are saying, `Listen, let's have a responsible commercial approach to this sale.' But no, they have to retain the discretion on the part of the minister, which has absolutely zero effect, because they know, as we know, that the discretionary power has never been used. Yet when it comes to the float of one&hyphen;third of Telstra, the tentacles of the ALP will cost the Australian taxpayers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8366"> perhaps billions of dollars because a non&hyphen;commercial direction remains in the sale process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important point is that we are going to support this amendment because, in the broader interests of the Australian people, one&hyphen;third of Telstra has to be sold. It is not because the enterprise can do with some private sector interest. It is not just because governments should not be in the business of running telecommunications companies. It is because we want to make a $1.2 billion commitment to the environment. It is the Labor Party that is continually talking up the environment and then undermining it, talking up telecommunications, getting services out to the bush and getting services to the people in most need, and then taking the rug out from underneath them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Dobell knows, the ALP has done absolutely nothing for the people in most need in terms of telecommunications services in rural and regional areas of Australia. Yet the hypocrisy which has filled this chamber and the Senate over the last few months whilst the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill has been debated has been overwhelming when it comes to the lack of commitment by the Australian Labor Party to, firstly, a commercial enterprise and, secondly, getting services to those most in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell talked about cheaper phone calls for the city and the people in the bush not getting the opportunity for cheaper phone calls. As part of the overall telecommunications package which was introduced by my colleague the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), people in the bush are going to get a fair go, and they are going to get a fair go through competition. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is appropriate, as a member representing a rural seat, that I speak briefly to these amendments to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. It is particularly important because it is clear, as I said during the discussion of a matter of public importance earlier in the week, that very few mem <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> bers of the National Party or the Liberal Party representing regional seats are prepared to come into this place and defend rural and regional Australia. I do note that the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) is in the chamber at the moment. I look forward to his contribution. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, of the point I made two days ago when I said that during the second reading debate on the Telstra sale bill only two National Party members were prepared to come into this place and defend rural and regional Australia on this issue. I recognise, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, that you were one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to speak in particular to amendment No. 17. I do not want to go to the technical points. I want to pick up on what the member for Chifley (Mr Price) was saying about the need for ministerial direction in order that services be maintained in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pick up on what the member for Chifley said by drawing an analogy between the sale of Telstra and the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. I ask honourable members how many of them have had Commonwealth Bank branches close in their electorates and how many of them as a result have contacted the state managers of the Commonwealth Bank and sought their assistance.</PARA>

We have to keep in mind the interests of our shareholders. We can't be making such decisions on the basis of the protection of rural and regional Australia. This is a business now and we must protect the investment of those shareholders.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many members have experienced that? How many members went to the Treasurer of the day to seek his assistance? How many members were told the very same thing: `Look, the government can't intervene in these decisions. This is a partially floated business now. We have shareholders to protect'? The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) whinges and whines and tells me it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8367"> was my government. I tell the member for North Sydney it was not my government at all. I was not part of that government. I am not in this place to defend the decisions of the previous government. I am in this place to defend my constituents in my rural electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, more particularly, I find myself having to come in here and defend all rural and regional Australia because there are simply no members on the other side, with a couple of exceptions that I have mentioned, that are prepared to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, unless we maintain ministerial direction, rural and regional Australia will miss out. Kids in rural and regional Australia will not have the same opportunity as their city cousins. We will not talk about the missed opportunity of people in rural and regional Australia through price reductions as they will experience massive price increases in the cost of their telecommunications services. That will be the case even under the partial privatisation of Telstra; but it will certainly be the case if we do not maintain ministerial direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's not make the same mistakes that we made in the past. I am happy to recognise them. I did not support the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. I certainly was not part of that government. Let's learn by our mistakes. As I said, I am not here to defend the previous government. I am here to protect rural and regional Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Protection of regional and rural Western Australia interests me greatly as that is exactly how my electorate would be defined. It is 220,000 square kilometres, has 62 local authorities and the people have re&hyphen;elected me with ever&hyphen;increasing margins and with an erosion of two per cent of the Labor vote every time, and they know and trust my advice on these things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth looking at this whole issue in the way that these people opposite are trying to portray it. To back up their arguments, they got their majority with the socialists of the Democrats and others to put up a second report on cross&hyphen;subsidy  and all the problems <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the rural areas. They made sure they had control of that particular committee, the report of which they called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telstra&mdash;to sell or not to sell</EMPHASIS>. They ignored the fact that previously when they were in government they got their expenditure committee, of which they also had control, to put up a report, which is in our records, labelled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS>. It specifically dealt with the cross&hyphen;subsidy at a time when it was not their government that was running the cross&hyphen;subsidy story; it was Telecom, as it was then known, trying to protect its monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality of all this was that they wanted a different outcome. So, with the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) in control of the expenditure committee, they brought out <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS>. But what did <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS> say about cross&hyphen;subsidy? Paragraph 7.8 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whatever the accounting difficulties, the Committee still supports the present cross&hyphen;subsidy for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is crucial to distinguish between `cross&hyphen;subsidy' and `profitability'. Telecom customers in high&hyphen;cost areas are not necessarily unprofitable for Telecom. They contribute less per service than users in low&hyphen;cost districts but their contribution to Telecom's revenue is still positive. Non&hyphen;metropolitan customers of Telecom in 1984&hyphen;85 paid for all the direct costs incurred in their districts as well as for $433.8 million of Telecom's total indirect costs.</PARA>
<PARA>They are trying to tell us that a new and privatised company will throw that sort of revenue away. But they went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further benefit to the system provided by urban and remote users which may be offset against the costs of their service lies in what economists call an `access externality'. Put simply, this means that the value of telecommunications systems to any particular user will increase as the total number of users with whom he or she can communicate increases.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it takes two phones to make a telephone call and a lot of people would not buy a metropolitan service if they could not ring people in the country. They are not my words. They are the words of the Labor Party dominated expenditure committee. I think the minister at the table, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), was also there and he will confirm that that committee was dominated by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8368">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it suited you to put that issue down, you produced the facts. There they are in 1984&hyphen;85. Probably $1 billion now of Telstra's indirect operating costs are being funded by its rural people. The suggestion is that you are going to run around and tell them that you do not want them as customers. In a commercial arena of course you will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have this problem that we have to have ministerial control because of jobs. I see that the matter of public importance yesterday was, `If you privatise National Rail there'll be a loss of jobs.' That raises one simple question: if a private operator is going to reduce the number of employees on the grounds of efficiency in the national interest, in the taxpayer's interest, why has it not happened already? Why are you, as the representatives of the taxpayer, demanding unnecessary jobs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A business organisation, be it the property of the taxpayer or the private sector, should not be a welfare organisation. It should operate efficiently and of course welfare should be a separate vote in the budget and we should have all the compassion in the world when we deal with that situation. But any job that is not productive within Australia, whomsoever the employer, is very damaging to our economy. We have to be prepared to differentiate, in the interests of all the people of Australia, not some little section that believes they have the right to a job where there is no work.

The member for North Sydney knows, as does every government member, that a third, plus a third, plus a third equals the whole sale and privatisation of Telstra. So let the Australian people be in no confusion about this matter: the government is talking about a full sale of Telstra, as certain as night follows day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members on the government side should be thanking the opposition with regard to the sale value of Telstra. The truth is that the shareholder value of Telstra improves year after year after year. The Labor Party is passionately opposed to the privatisation. But any financial analyst would tell you that, if you are silly enough to try to privatise Telstra, now is not the time to do it because the shareholder value of this instrumentality has been improving by 20 per cent year after year after year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These figures are a great credit to the former minister, the member for Dobell, who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8369"> is present in the chamber. There is Telstra's huge profit increase of 31 per cent in the last financial year. Telstra's unit costs have been cut by 10 per cent during the past financial year and, on its own reckoning, are now eight per cent below the average for world telecommunications companies. At 30 June this year costs were $565 per line per year, compared with a world average of $612. For the past few years the shareholder value&mdash;and until now there has been just one shareholder, the Commonwealth of Australia&mdash;has been increasing by 20 per cent. Do not lecture us about the sale value of Telstra. If you are silly enough to privatise, you are doubly silly if you do it now because the value is increasing by 20 per cent year after year after year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know where the member for North Sydney gets these ideas from, because he is a protege of the member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey). When Mr Fahey was Premier of New South Wales, taking the flawed advice of the member for North Sydney, it was well known throughout the State of New South Wales that they only ever had one plan&mdash;and that was to renovate the Premier's penthouse while at the same time the Premier was taking TA.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Werriwa was talking about the fact that Telstra would be worth more some time in the future if it were to be sold. Can I give the member for Werriwa a little tip? The all&hyphen;ordinaries index of the share market is travelling at somewhere around 2,150 points. When the ALP sold the Commonwealth Bank, the initial tranche was around 1,600; when they sold Qantas into the market, it was probably around 1,800.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to be logical&mdash;and I know that it is very hard for the member for Werriwa to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8370"> understand&mdash;usually the market continues to grow. It is a good idea to sell into a rising market. It is only the ALP that tends to sell into falling markets.

But this government will even address the problem that has been given to us by the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, we have said that, if we are to try to have some direction on Telstra, we will use the regulatory powers to do so, in the same way that we would have that effect on Optus or any other provider that comes into play after 1 July next year. Secondly, we will not do what the ALP does: we will not be abject hypocrites. We will not come into this chamber and say, `Listen, we're not going to tell you about anything we do not do.'

It is a terrible thing, this tentacles of socialism, isn't it? We could almost imagine Jack McEwen being one of the greatest devotees of the tentacles of socialism as described by the honourable member for North Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just ridiculous for the honourable member for North Sydney to try to describe an amendment that his own minister and his own party are accepting as the tentacles of socialism here today. He seeks to say that the issues we are raising can, in some way, be dealt with through the normal regulatory powers. He nods his head in agreement with that. He is agreeing with himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem he has not yet understood is that the telecommunications competition regime that his government has announced does not protect the subscribers in the way that they should. His government's telecommunications regime will allow Telstra to drop the price of local calls in his electorate, and Telstra will not be forced to drop the price of local calls in Bathurst in the electorate of Calare, or in Gladstone in the electorate of Hinkler, or even in Launceston in the electorate of the minister at the table. That is what the government's regulatory powers do not cover. That is why we say that, ultimately, the minister should be held accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In case people think that, in some way, the Labor Party is exaggerating the risk, let me remind the House that 10 days ago the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) also thought these protections were there. The Prime Minister misled his own party room when he gave this pledge, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Howard's pledge to the Government party&hyphen;room that those in remote areas will have all the "whiz-bangery" that the new technology has to offer&mdash;at the same price as those in the cities.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Prime Minister even believed that protections were there 10 days ago. Yet after <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Prime Minister got into trouble on Monday of this week in question time, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  stated on Tuesday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His office said later that local call charges would not be allowed to rise in regional Australia&mdash;or anywhere else&mdash;but the extent of price reductions could vary between areas.</PARA>
<PARA>Further in the same article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Communications, Senator Alston, has confirmed Telstra will be free to charge different prices for consumers in different cities or towns when the industry is opened up to all&hyphen;comers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So your own Prime Minister and your own Minister for Communications (Senator Alston) have admitted that this can happen under your own new regulatory regime. There is no protection there. That is why you need to make sure the minister retains the power of direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put three questions to the minister. I know other members might wish to jump to continue this debate but I would ask them to show some restraint and let us have the answer from the minister to these questions. Then perhaps they might jump after the minister. Having appealed for restraint from other members who might be about to jump, I would ask the minister if he might answer these questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, if Telstra does seek to introduce a charge for directory assistance, will the government use the minister's power of direction to stop them? Secondly, if Telstra tried to drop the price of local calls in Chatswood and in the suburbs where Optus is currently competing but not in the rest of Australia, will the minister issue a direction to make sure Telstra retains that standard 25c local call charge across the country? Thirdly, will the minister also give us an assurance that, if Telstra acts in any way that is against the public interest, the minister will issue a direction?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three simple questions: if Telstra introduces charging for directory assistance, if Telstra introduces differential pricing for what we now have as the standard uniform local all, or if Telstra acts against the public interest&mdash;will you use that power of direction? Will you protect the public interest? What is your <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8372"> answer, Minister?

If, member for Werriwa, you were so passionate about the public ownership of Telstra, why was it that, just prior to last election, you were prepared to sell off the technology division of Telstra with 400 jobs? You are not passionate about it at all. When it suits you to do something or sell something, you do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I find breathtaking is that, while you talk about being passionate about the public ownership of Telstra and you talk about being passionate about defending the rights of the bush, how is it that you wouldn't support the $250 million telecommunications infrastructure fund? If you were really fair dinkum about rural Tasmania and rural western Queensland, which are probably the two most vulnerable parts of Australia in terms of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> telecommunications&mdash;not, I hasten to mention, through any fault of Telstra's but because of the geography of those areas&mdash;why didn't you support that fund?

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8373">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed they wheeled out the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) to intervene in this debate on the issue of community service obligations. The basic text of what he was trying to advance is that there is no such thing as community service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who is at the table, well knows that when he was shadow minister there were studies done&mdash;one by the Bureau of Transport Economics, another by the Industry Commission and, of course, Telecom did its own study. There may be a debate about the size of community service obligations but there is no debate as to whether they exist, as the honourable member for O'Connor argues. I think that is absurd. I am surprised that he seeks to attack the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles apart</EMPHASIS>, which, from memory, was not dissented from by a coalition member at the time, whether they were of the socialist variety or the socialist hating variety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard some absurd propositions advanced for the bush. The high priest of contestability, Henry Ergas, the mentor of the present minister, is one who has advanced a lot of crazy ideas, but the craziest idea was that we should actually set aside areas&mdash;like the electorate of the member for O'Connor&mdash;requiring infrastructure and put them up for the highest bidder. In other words, do not force Telecom to provide the service. That is absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back to hypocrisy. I have only a couple of minutes to say that I defend every intervention I have made or association I have had in terms of communications changes. I have always sought to grow Telecom, to see it in a stronger position for a competitive environment. There ought to be some benchmarks so that when we return in the future we can see what has been accomplished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening with research and development in communications? Will this increase dramatically as it has over the years, or will it be cut back?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to concentrate on one thing in this debate on Telstra because the vote has been lost by those of us who wish that Telstra would remain in public hands. That billion dollar trust being set up for the environment is an absolute fraud. I wanted to ask the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) the other day, but I did not get the opportunity: does he realise that it costs a dollar wholesale for one root stock to be planted out there in the countryside? There are one billion trees available from this billion dollar fund. We have already embarked on a billion tree planting which is yet to show any sign on the horizon of any impact on the enormity of the environmental problems facing us out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I made a speech in this House on the heritage bill, on the need to improve our spending on and our commitment to the environment, I mentioned the Murray&hyphen;Darling alone as of such enormous environmental consequence that it would not be a 2001 project we should embark on but a 2101 project. The former spokesman for the opposition, the member for Barker, Mr McLachlan, came up to me afterwards and agreed that it is a 100&hyphen;year at least project that we are looking at in the Murray&hyphen;Darling alone, if I remember his statements correctly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This billion dollar trust, part of which has already been committed, will go absolutely nowhere. To show just what sort of a fraud this billion dollar trust fund is and how much we have given away to establish it, I will read from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chain Reaction</EMPHASIS>, a magazine I received yesterday. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Howard Government's proposed Natural Heritage Trust is a `blatant and cynical political fraud', a senior Government adviser has admitted to Scitech. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said the policy&mdash;the Coalition's claimed answer to rectifying Australia's enormous environmental problems&mdash;was `invented overnight' as a means of attempting to soften potential public reaction against the planned sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plan had been essentially devised&mdash;as a `purely political exercise'&mdash;by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb, and had then been `imposed' on the former shadow Minister . . . Senator Rod Kemp, and subsequently, on . . . Senator Robert Hill . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The adviser said Coalition MPs openly joked behind closed doors about the policy and admitted to the fact that it could not possibly&mdash;in its current form or size&mdash;make any serious impact on the nation's massive problems of land degradation, ailing rivers, and loss of biodiversity.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said the extent of the deceit had `sickened' him.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of hypocrisy we have in the establishment of this fraud. I have argued strongly, as did Senator Kernot when she took up this argument, that we should have established a $250 million per year quarantined fund for the environment if we had any real commitment to the environment. I have argued for the retention of Telstra on a jobs basis in regional Australia, as a community service obligation and as a cross-subsidisation factor to the telephony services which will not be delivered in a private market and will not be delivered by market forces because the profit margin is just not out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the export earnings we could have earned from a publicly retained Telstra are obvious. There is $2 trillion worth of business out there in Asia over the next 10 years of which Telstra will be part. But, unfortunately, the Australian shareholders, those who own those shares now in that publicly owned corporation will not enjoy that. That is the price. That is what we have given away and that is why I am so impassioned not only about the destruction of this publicly owned institution but also that the billion dollar fund is a fraud. Where do we go after that to fund the environment? I am as committed to the environment as the next person&mdash;I think perhaps more than most&mdash;having watched the degradation of the environment in my region <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8375"> over 20 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Calare (Mr Andren) is correct: coalition members believe in the Natural Heritage Trust only because they believe in the sale of Telstra. Coalition members believe in the regional telecommunications fund only because they believe in the sale of Telstra. In believing in the sale of Telstra they are wrong because they are ripping away the tiers of the safety net that provide protection for people in regional Australia in the basic service of telecommunications. They are ripping away the first tier of the safety net&mdash;public ownership&mdash;and ripping away the second tier by talking down instead of talking up the provisions and use of section 183. Initially, in the Senate they tried to rip away the third and last tier of the safety net, the ministerial directives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why it is so important for this House to restore the ministerial directives to the coalition's bill. The ministerial directives are paramount and critical because they are the instrument by which government, in quality hands, can actually provide universal service obligations and provisions for regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a unique country. We do not easily fit the textbook economic model. Australia is a large country geographically with dispersed centres of population and economic activity. In those circumstances, there is an extra role for government in funding the additional cost of distance&mdash;the cost of distance and service provisions that the free market alone will not provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) has adopted the fatal flaw of the free market model for the distribution of services and universality in Australia. He will need to rename his society from `John Stuart Mill' to `Adam Smith'. He needs to recognise that the so&hyphen;called tentacles of socialism are very important in funding the extra cost of distance in a country as large as ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If government does not fund the extra cost of distance in telecommunications, railways, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> transport and all the basic services in regional Australia, the free market will not. That is why it is paramount to have ministerial directives by which universality can be imposed upon the new board of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) so correctly asked the minister at the table, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), to answer these three points: will this government apply ministerial directives to the charges for directory assistance; will this government apply ministerial directives to the uniform local call rate; and will this government apply ministerial directives for any other public interest consideration coming before the new board of Telstra? They are the three points that the minister needs to address in his final statement to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other than that, I express the concern of the Labor Party that so many tiers of the safety net have been ripped away for regional Australia. Regional Australia has suffered enough at the hands of this government without losing the strength of the universal service obligations in telecommunications. Take one seat in regional Australia, the seat of Dawson, and you will find: the closure of the Taxation Office and Family Court facilities; the abolition of regional development programs; the loss of university and employment funding and programs; the reef tax hurting tourism; the loss of taxation concessions for cooperative companies&mdash;</PARA>

It is recognised that the Senate amendments&mdash;17 in total&mdash;to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 are a significant issue. I indicated earlier in the day that the government will accept the amendments and, since the opposition have indicated that they will accept the amendments, they will pass.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a great range of debate, much of it covered in previous debates, and some of it, I do not doubt, will be covered in further debate about the post&hyphen;1997 arrangements for the telecommunications industry. I want to make only a couple of points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is the question of ministerial direction, which is amendment No. 17. We will be accepting that amendment and it will pass. That effectively means that the power of direction will be part of the regime that will emerge from the legislative process. The power of direction is a statutory power that has not been exercised in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the questions raised by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the member for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Dobell (Mr Lee), the government's expectation is that any public interest controls&mdash;which is fundamentally what they were asking about&mdash;would be exercised through the regulatory mechanisms, which apply to all carriers. If the government sought to exercise any control over Telstra in its capacity as a shareholder, it would do so by exercising the rights attaching to the two&hyphen;thirds of the shares owned, not by exercising the power of direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, and also in respect of amendment No. 17, which is a key amendment, the government will seek further advice on the operation of the Corporations Law&mdash;the requirements of disclosure and the prospectus, and the requirements of the stock exchange as to where those securities are to be listed. You would appreciate that that is an issue on which we would take further advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the government is prepared to accept the amendments. I do not want to enter into the other debates about regional funding and the Natural Heritage Trust, and so on. Those matters are best left for another time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very significant point in the consideration of the telecommunications legislation. Those who have been following this debate for some time will appreciate that fact. By accepting the Senate's amendments, the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 will become law and the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra will proceed.</PARA>

We have talked about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8377"> the development of the Australian flag from its earliest manifestations in the era of 1606&mdash;I traced it from then right through to today. I point out too that that has carried with it the development of our legal and parliamentary codes, and for that reason the flag has a very important position in our democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one aspect that I have not spoken about that I would like to touch on briefly before I finish. That is, the flag, as an insignia of leadership, as the embodiment of the history and the character of the nation, is the thing that we carry into battle. Although the flag perhaps does not have the same significance in this mechanised and atomic age that it might have had in the past, it is still very much an important symbol to those who have served in the Australian forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flag was always used as a symbol of identifying friend or foe. It was a rallying point&mdash;was it not?&mdash;in battles. Even as recently as the Second World War, there were a number of occasions where battles were turned with some young soldier racing forward with the national flag, a banner, and using that as a rallying point for troops. For that reason, one can understand that the many RSL sub-branches around Australia have a great affection for this flag. The people they represent have played a significant part in defending that flag not just with words and not just with deeds but with their sheer physical effort, many times with their imprisonment and still, more importantly, on many occasions with their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year during the Australia Remembers activities I met with RSL clubs in little communities like Eidsvold, Monto, Childers, Gin Gin, Miriam Vale, Calliope, Biloela, even those in little mining towns like Moura and those in the bigger centres like Bundaberg and Gladstone. I noticed that wherever I went there was a universality of affection for our flag and what it represented. Therefore, if we are planning to change the flag, we need to have mechanisms in place that ensure that the Australian population as a whole has a say in how that would happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great tragedies of this era that we have lived in&mdash;where we have discussed the republic, the constitution and the flag&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has been the way many people, including the former Prime Minister, have made light of our symbols, criticised them overseas and played with them in the parliament. With this Flags Amendment Bill 1996, we have laid down very clearly once and for all that this flag can be changed only by a majority of the electors in the states and territories and that they must be given a choice between the current Australian flag&mdash;the one that is viewed with so much affection&mdash;and other flags, and that whichever flag is chosen will become the flag of this country. It also provides the mechanisms whereby such a referendum would occur, and they appear under proposed subsection 3(2) and proposed subsection 3(3) of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, although I have a great affection for this flag&mdash;I recognise the price in blood that has been paid to defend it, I recognise the history that it contains, I recognise the character that it embodies&mdash;if under this bill a majority of Australians decide they do want to change it, I will be satisfied that it is a full and frank expression of the national will, and that is something that I would readily embrace. In the meantime, I believe that we have been well served by this flag and that it should be retained and be recognised with a place of honour in this nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise with great pleasure to speak on the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. Following on from the comments of the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) in which he displayed his affection for the flag, I too concur with those comments that the Australian flag&mdash;although it has been officially with us in terms of being proclaimed only since 1953&mdash;is a flag which has certainly touched the hearts and won the affection of all Australians. I want to speak to this bill as a sign of my support for the current flag and the pride that I have when displaying it, be it in my office or in the presence of the local RSL communities or even seeing it displayed in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key intent of the bill is to reflect the intention of the Australian national flag belonging to the Australian people. The Australian people, not the parliament, have a right to be consulted in any proposal to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8378"> change our flag. This bill provides the parliament with a means to give the people of Australia a guarantee that, if they determine a change is needed, the current flag will always be included in any vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not really matter to a great extent whether I have an affection for the flag, whether I agree with the flag, whether I like the design or not&mdash;even though I would like to convey my opinion on the matter&mdash;but it does matter whether or not the other 18&half; million people in Australia have an affection for the flag and whether or not they wish to retain the flag and see it flown over our buildings and our institutions. It is their wish that must be abided by. It is their confidence that we need to take into account when looking at designs of flags and whether or not the flag should in fact be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When announcing the government's intention to introduce this legislation, the Prime Minister, John Howard, on Anzac Day earlier this year, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will mean that no politician, no political party and no special interest group will be able to tamper with the design of our flag.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the intent is. While at this stage we have the Australian Labor Party and a whole lot of other groups saying that they have no intention of tampering with the flag, I am not so sure what the situation will be in years to come. Will legislators in the future have that same desire not to tamper with our flag? I am not confident of that eventuality and I want to make sure that the flag is protected against that level of tampering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Flags Amendment Bill 1996 amends the Flags Act 1953 by providing that the present Australian national flag can only be replaced if a majority of state and territory electors agree. The Flags Act 1953 formerly established the Commonwealth blue ensign as the Australian national flag. At that time, the then Prime Minister Robert Menzies, in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is very largely a formal measure which puts into legislative form what has become almost the established practice in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I say this for a very important reason. Many on the Labor side&mdash;detractors of the Austral <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ian flag&mdash;claim that the flag has only been with us since 1953 and that Australians have not fought under the flag. They have fought under the American flag, the British flag and the South African flag, but not the Australian flag. What happened in 1953 was merely a formalisation of what had taken place in previous years. The current Australian flag flew over the site for the national capital as early as 1908, on the first ships of the new navy in 1910 and at the first Australian base on the Antarctic continent&mdash;that white expanse to our south&mdash;in 1911. Since 1953, it has been flown continuously by all our territories and states, including the Australian Antarctic bases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that all Australians will now have a chance to decide on the change to one of the most important national symbols&mdash;our flag. The history of the flag must also be recognised and mentioned in this debate. I would like to refer in part to it. When six Australian colonies federated to form a single Commonwealth on 1 January 1901, a new nation was born and a new century was heralded. At that time there was an urgent demand for a new emblem. An official competition was arranged for a design which attracted 32,823 entries. Five of these, which submitted almost identical designs, were placed equal first. Apart from later changes in the magnitudes of the stars and the number of points, they produced the present Australian flag. The new flag heralded Australia's entry into nationhood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flag is an important symbol that has been flown in this country for many years. One of the most symbolic displays of the Australian flag is often attributed to sporting events and, in particular, to the Olympic games. It is interesting to note that since 1908 it has been raised for medal winners at every Olympic Games&mdash;a long tradition with this nation and a tradition that must be upheld.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Younger people identify the flag with Australia's sporting success and achievement. They see their sporting heroes wrapping themselves in the flag. It is an unashamed display of pride in being Australian, pride in the flag and in what it symbolises. Who could forget the emotional scenes during the Atlanta <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8379"> Olympics when our sporting heroes had the flag raised. Cathy Freeman, from my electorate, wrapped herself in the flag. While there have been those who have criticised sporting heroes like Cathy Freeman for running around the track with an Aboriginal flag, the national Australian flag has always been present. Cathy Freeman has expressed the pride she has in displaying the Australian flag&mdash;and so it should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my 10 months as the member for Deakin, I have had the pleasure of being part of numerous school flag presentations. It is not unique. Every member in this chamber is called on from time to time to present school flags to exchange students going overseas. When you unfurl the flag to have a photo taken, you can see the beam on their faces. They have great pride at being Australian and in being able to take this symbol overseas. The students that I presented with flags have gone to countries such as Germany, the United States, Italy, Spain and Portugal&mdash;some have gone to the Paralympics. They have all had the flag to take with them as a reminder of their nation, their culture and their identity. The exchange students have used the flag as a gift for their host families. These young Australians are proud ambassadors of our country. They take with them the Australian flag and symbols kits as a means to educate their hosts on who we are and what our emblems are all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flag is very important for, every day, it represents us in hundreds of places around the world. We may not have paid diplomats or peacekeeping soldiers in these places but we have ordinary Australians overseas who proudly display the national flag&mdash;young and old alike. Its mere presence overseas is a simple but potent reminder of where we live, who we are and our role in the international community. At citizenship and other ceremonies, emotion wells up when the flag is raised on the flagpole. As Australians we need these symbols.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although symbols may be changed and symbols may be introduced as we progress through generations, the symbols of the past must be retained. One of the symbols that emerges from time to time and that people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say we should have some attachment to is the boxing kangaroo. The boxing kangaroo was a powerful symbol for that period in history when a certain event took place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have symbols in the form of songs which we hear every now and then. One example is the song, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I still call Australia home</EMPHASIS>, by great Australian singer and song writer Peter Allan. That conjures up high emotions when we hear it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for North Sydney reminds me of `C'mon Aussie c'mon'. These are very powerful symbols which are relevant for young and old Australians alike. The flag was our national tag in battle. Hundreds of thousands of Australians have fought under it outside Australian territory. The emotional significance of this fact must never be forgotten. As I go around to the various RSLs in my electorate&mdash;the Mitcham, Blackburn, Croydon and Ringwood RSLs&mdash;and as I watch veterans march down the streets to their memorials one can see the unashamed display and identification with this flag that takes place. It would be betraying these people if future legislators changed this national symbol without the Australian population being considered when designing a future flag. This bill gives power to the people in making changes to our flag if and when required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken about the symbolism of the flag in the past. As we are becoming more global and opening up our borders&mdash;we see this in Europe and with the various trade pacts with NAFTA and APEC&mdash;we are becoming a more unified world. It tends to make us want to revert to some of the more tribal and more traditional ties that we have. We see this taking place in Europe. I refer particularly to the regionality that is taking place, whether in Italy, Spain, Holland or eastern Europe. As the borders are coming down people are looking for symbols and ties and they say, `Yes, I am European or Australian or American.' They can then say that they are from a particularly territory. In Spain they are Catalonians. In northern Italy we are starting to see the emergence of the Northern <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8380"> League as a means of identification and unification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things will happen as we move towards a more globalised world. Symbolism is important. Identification with our flag will have even greater prominence as a symbol of who we are in the world. As I said earlier, we should retain our flag with great pride.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main argument I hear from those opposite is that the blue is great, the Southern Cross is great because it symbolises where we are in the world, the seven pointed star is fine as the points represent the states and territories, but it is the little thing in the left hand corner that they do not like because it represents a colonial past which we must get rid of. As someone who does not come from Ireland, Scotland or England and does not have any ancestors from that particular part of the world, but whose ancestors are from Europe, I look at the flag as an entire entity. I do not consider the flag to be broken up into three separate components. I consider the flag in its entirety. I look at it and say, `That is my flag.' I am proud of that flag. I do not say, `There is the Union Jack in the corner. I cannot have that because I am not British.' That is an absurd argument. It reflects on where we have come from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) made the point, when responding to a comment by a member relating to a seven&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child saying, `Why change our flag? It is our flag after all' about whether that seven&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child would have the same views when he is 17, 27 or 57 years of age. I say to the member for Throsby that a flag is not something that you discard like clothing because all of a sudden you have grown out of it. A flag symbolises a nation in its entirety. In 10, 20 or 50 years time are we expected to change our flag and our symbols? Are we to end up with roving symbols of a nation, symbols which reflect how we feel at the time and the mood of the legislators?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Support for the flag is fairly widespread. An AGB McNair poll taken on 26 to 28 June this year asked 2,057 voters whether they thought the Australian flag should be changed. Some 66 per cent said no, 27 per cent said yes and seven per cent did not know. Subsequent <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public opinion polls, whether they be Morgan or AGB McNair polls, have come up with similar figures. Two-thirds of Australian people do not want our flag changed. It is a powerful statement. This result has been consistent all the way through.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Cunningham says that it is just like New Zealand's. The member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), who is not in the chamber at the moment, raised the issue in his speech&mdash;and I am sorry that the member for Cunningham was not in the chamber at that time. Should we change our flag just because it is similar to New Zealand's and someone was embarrassed when they were overseas and the New Zealand flag went up rather than the Australian flag? If embarrassment is caused by that, then it should not be Australia that is embarrassed but the host who did not know what flag to put up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many flags around the world that are very similar. Tricolour flags are very common. The colours can either be horizontal or vertical. I do not know the difference between a lot of them. I know that many people in this chamber would not know the difference between a lot of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hinkler rightly referred to flags from Germany and Scandinavia as being very similar to other flags. Does it mean that those countries should change their flags because there is some confusion in the minds of foreign visitors and dignitaries about what flag they fly? It is absurd to suggest that we should change our flag because it is similar to New Zealand's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we move towards a global community and as people come to know what Australia is&mdash;that we are not Austria&mdash;and that we are in the Southern Hemisphere, there will be a recognition of all our symbols, rather than Australia simply being recognised as a country where kangaroos hop down Pitt Street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every now and then the Ausflag committee comes up with various designs. I have some designs in front of me at the moment. They are not unattractive designs. Some look like <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8381"> they would make very good rugby tops; some look like they would make very good symbols for a footy team. But they are not our flag. The symbols that often come up on these flags are symbols such as the Southern Cross&mdash;we have got the Southern Cross; another is the seven point star&mdash;we have got the seven point star; another is the kangaroo&mdash;the kangaroo is represented in our coat of arms, and rightly so. There is already a place for those symbols. Some people say that we should have a green and gold flag. The green and gold is already embodied in one of our other symbols&mdash;the national colours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some even raise the issue of the Union Jack not being ours. One of our national symbols is the golden wattle, but let us look at where the golden wattle is distributed on the Australian continent. It does not exist in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland or Tasmania. It partly touches the southern corner of South Australia. Does that mean that the people of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland and Tasmania are unrepresented in our floral emblem? Of course it does not. These symbols are representative. They are part of our identity, whether or not we have a direct connection with one of them because of our ethnicity or geography.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In making this legislative change, the Howard government seeks to end the process of removing by stealth, without consultation, important symbolic practices and traditions. Changes that took place under the previous government included removing the portrait of the Queen and removing the use of the word `royal' in official government titles and institutions. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. I do not intend to speak for long. It is with great pride that I rise to support the bill. It does nothing more nor less than put in the people's hands the power to decide whether the flag is going to be changed. This bill came about because of the fear that was placed in the Australian people and in coalition members when the ALP were in government that they would change the flag without reference to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people. They had in the past made various changes to national symbols and national colours without proper reference to the people. While I did not disagree with many of those decisions, I believe that the people should always be consulted on these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this bill we are simply saying to the Australian people, `If you want to change your flag, whatever your opinion is, well and good. But that decision is not one for the parliament. That decision is one for the people of Australia.' I do not think that anybody could object to that course of action being taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a tactic around to denigrate the Union Jack, as it is sometimes called, taking up a quarter of the flag in the top-left hand corner. It has been a symbol ridiculed by some. They have said it is outdated, that it is a cause of shame in this country and that, therefore, we have to change the flag. To me it has meant something else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are basically still an Anglo&hyphen;Celtic country, though that is changing, and there is nothing wrong with that. But the system of justice that we have in this country that has served us so well, for all its faults, comes from the United Kingdom. Our system of democracy, which I will admit we sometimes take too much for granted in this country, largely comes from that part of the world. Our system of education, for all its faults, comes from that part of the world. The language that we predominantly speak in this country, our official language&mdash;the English language&mdash;comes from that part of the world. So much of every day life, so much of the good things that we enjoy, so much of our traditional basis and standard of living, come from that part of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether you come from Italy, as the previous speaker did, or Macedonia, Albania, Cuba, Ethiopia&mdash;or even England and Ireland, as my forbears did&mdash;it is undeniable that this country has been shaped, rightly or wrongly, by the influx of people from that part of the world. That was recognised when the flag was put in place at the beginning of this century by having the Union Jack&mdash;the Union Flag, as it is sometimes called&mdash;in the top-left hand <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8382"> corner of the Australian flag. I do not see anything wrong with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people think it means that we are somehow subservient or still tied to the apron strings of England, that it is a thing of shame, that it represents a cultural cringe in this country. While I can see some validity in that argument, I think it means quite the reverse. It should show, if it does not, that we are a mature society, that we are very confident in ourselves and that we are Australians. All it represents is the heritage which exists in this country and which I mentioned earlier. It does not mean that we are subservient to England or anything else of the type.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are, to a large extent, a multicultural society in this country and we are becoming more so. We have a mix of blood from 150 to 170 countries running in our veins. Those people came here by choice. They came here by choice because they looked at Australia and saw that it was good place and, in most cases, a better place than that whence they came. They came knowing that the Union Jack flies in the corner of our flag and, to a large extent, they are quite happy with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to comment on the fact that it is a very beautiful flag. I had not fully appreciated that, I have to say, until this debate sprang up in the last decade or so and I looked at some of the suggestions that have been put forward if we are going to change our flag to another flag. For the first time in my life I realised how difficult it is to design a flag which is acceptable to everyone and, at the same time, pleasing to the eye.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the suggestions put up, for example, by the Ausflag competition are quite ludicrous. Most countries in the world&mdash;I have only just consciously come to realise&mdash;have only two or three stripes running horizontally, vertically or, sometimes, diagonally across their flag. With the odd exception, such as France, which is well known because of the Tricolour&mdash;the red, white and blue&mdash;you would not have the faintest idea which country those flags represent. It is very confusing indeed. They seem to have every combination of colour running in every possible direction for no particular reason.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ours is a very distinctive flag. There are not that many countries in the world that have very distinctive flags with symbols on them which actually mean something, which represent the people who live in the country and their traditions. One of the latest flags to be designed is the present flag of South Africa, which is very distinctive. It is a very complex flag, but it represents the many peoples who live in that country and the things that that country stands for. I think that is a very good flag. It is an example where a flag that has been changed with very good reason seems to be working very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps, in the future, someone will design such a flag for Australia. All we are asking for in this bill is that that design be put forward to the Australian people and let a majority of the Australian people in a majority of states vote on that. If that is the will of the Australian people, I, as a person who stands up for democracy, am prepared to go along with that. At present, I am quite content with the flag we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker had a bit of argy-bargy with some people across the chamber that our flag was very similar to the flag of New Zealand, and I acknowledge that point. It is a valid point, but I do not necessarily think we should change our flag because it is similar to the flag of some other country. It would be a bit like changing our name because the name of Australia is an Anglo name, it is not an Aboriginal name, and it is a name that is very similar to another country's name, namely, Austria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose that is a valid point of view to put forward, but I happen to be one who is very proud of the name Australia. A lot of the great countries of the world have names that begin with A and end in the letter A, such as America, Asia, Africa, Antarctica, et cetera&mdash;and Austria, for that matter. Just because we have a name similar to that of another country in the world, I do not think we necessarily should have to change it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The polls that have been conducted on this seem to run consistently very strongly in favour of retaining the Australian flag. While that continues to be the case, I do not think the Australian flag will be changed. That is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8383"> not to say that in 25, 50, 100 or 1,000 years time we may change to another flag. It happened in Canada. It was done relatively successfully there and, as I have said, it has happened in South Africa, with good reason. But there does not seem to be that imperative in Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I finish my speech, I would like to make some comments on another phenomenon that is sometimes associated with our flag&mdash;that is, the fact that some people, on occasion, choose to desecrate our flag. They often burn it in public to gain publicity for the particular cause that they are championing at the time. I think this is a very cheap way to get publicity&mdash;to desecrate Australia's great national symbol in such a manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other countries, not Australia, have penalties for doing this. For example, our near neighbour New Zealand has a penalty for doing it. Norway has a penalty for doing it. Many other countries have penalties for doing it. They vary from fines right through to, in totalitarian countries, where you are virtually shot. It is regarded as a traitorous act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have introduced into the parliament a private member's bill to say that perhaps we should have penalties in this country for desecrating the flag. There are arguments on both  sides as to whether we should or whether we should not. I want to say that people who desecrate the flag with impunity, for whatever reason, should give very serious consideration before doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they are doing it because they do not like the flag, I think that they should lobby legitimately in a democratic country to change the flag in a proper and a mature way. If they are doing it because they are championing some other cause, then I believe that they should not use the flag in this way, because it offends many people. We should respect the flag, whatever else we might think of it, and we should respect the thoughts of others. Some say it is just a piece of cloth. If you say that it is just a piece of cloth, you have not got a soul. It represents much more than that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Flags Act 1953 to ensure that the current Australian national flag can only be replaced if a majority of voters in all states and territories agree. This bill seeks to protect Australia's greatest national symbol, our national flag. It means that no government can legislate to replace the flag without first receiving approval from the Australian public, voting at a referendum or a plebiscite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the way it should be, for the government does not own the flag&mdash;it belongs to the people of Australia. It is a symbol of who we are and where we have come from. It is the one thing that unites us all as Australians and, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8384"> therefore, we should all have a say in whether it should be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before Federation, the Union Jack was the official flag of the six Australian colonies. However, with Federation, a new nation was born. With it came the urgent need for a new emblem to represent that nation. Shortly before the opening of the first parliament in 1901, the Commonwealth government decided to hold a competition to design two flags&mdash;one for official and naval purposes and the other for merchant ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This competition was run in conjunction with one conducted by a newspaper called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of Reviews</EMPHASIS>. The competition attracted more than 32,000 entries from throughout Australia and around the world, from people of all ages and backgrounds. The entries received were many and varied, ranging from the stately and expected to the more peculiar&mdash;such as native animals playing cricket with a winged cricket ball.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Five designs, which were almost identical, were selected as equal first and shared the &pound;200 prize money. The winning designs were named the Australian red and blue ensigns. On 3 September 1901, Prime Minister Edmund Barton announced the winners of the national flag competition. A flag of the winning design was flown on the Exhibition Building in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This design was exceedingly similar to the one we fly proudly today. Under the union of the British blue ensign was a large white star with six points representing the six states. In the fly of the flag there were five white stars representing the Southern Cross. I am both pleased and proud that, 95 years on, the Howard government has officially proclaimed 3 September as National Flag Day, so we will always remember the birthday of our most important national symbol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In February 1903, it was announced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Gazette</EMPHASIS> that King Edward VII had approved a design for the flag of Australia and also one for the flag of the merchant navy. Since then, the Australian national flag has remained largely unchanged. The only alteration in this time was made in 1908 with the addition of a seventh point to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth star to symbolise the Commonwealth territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only alteration at this time was made in 1908, with the addition of a seventh point to the Commonwealth star to symbolise the Commonwealth territories. The new flag heralded Australia's birth as a nation. It flew over the site for the national capital at Canberra in 1908, and at the opening of both the old and new parliament houses in Canberra in 1927 and 1988 respectively. It flew on the first ships of the new navy in 1910, and at the first Australian base on the Antarctic continent in 1911.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1908, it has also been raised for our medal winners at every Olympic Games. In 1956, it flew with pride as the flag of the host nation in Melbourne, and it will do so again in Sydney in 2000. The flag has also been carried into battle by the cruiser HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> in the first naval battle of World War I, by the Anzacs who landed on the beaches at Gallipoli and by the diggers who were victorious in France in 1917 and 1918. In World War II, when Singapore was retaken in 1945, the first flag to be flown was an Australian flag secretly made by Australian prisoners of war inside a Japanese prison camp. The men risked instant execution if found out, but made the ensign to help boost morale. When the camp was liberated the flag was proudly flown, a symbol of hope and freedom. The flag was also carried into the jungle battles of the Vietnam War and into the recent Gulf War.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that nothing symbolises a nation like its flag, and the Australian flag is firmly entrenched as one of our most cherished institutions. When we think of Australia, our identity and national pride, one of the first things that comes to mind is our flag. Some of our greatest achievements as a nation have been made with an Australian flag in sight. Who can forget the emotion and sense of pride we feel as we see our country's flag hoisted high during a medal ceremony at an Olympic or Commonwealth games, or when Australia's first astronaut, Andy Collins, proudly flew the flag in space; or the patriotism we felt when champions such as the Oarsome Foursome, Kieren Perkins or Cathy <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8385"> Freeman draped themselves in the Australian flag after winning their respective medals at this year's Atlanta Olympics; or the pride we feel when we see thousands of children and adults line the streets of cities and country towns waving our flag during Anzac parades, welcome home parades for our Olympians and the Australia Remembers parades of last year? Who can forget that emotional moment at the closing ceremony of the Atlanta Olympics when the Australian flag was raised to the cheers of the thousands of people at the stadium in honour of the host nation of the 2000 Olympics?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our flag is an authentic home&hyphen;grown symbol of our nation. Despite claims to the contrary, there was no requirement in the official rules of the government's original flag competition for there to be a Union Jack in the design. It was put there by the designers themselves and chosen unanimously by seven judges, representative of all Australians. It is true that until 1953, when the Flags Act formally established the Blue Ensign as the Australian national flag and prescribed the Red Ensign as the proper flag for merchant ships, there was some confusion about which flag could be flown publicly. Many people were uncertain whether the blue could be flown publicly or was restricted to official and government purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the Flags Act became law, both Prime Minister Robert Menzies and Prime Minister Ben Chifley issued press statements encouraging the Australian public to fly the blue ensign freely. The Menzies government also began issuing flags to all public schools and community groups, and directed that the flag be flown by all Commonwealth government departments. This tradition is continued today by the Howard government. We continue to promote the flag by enabling members of parliament and senators to issue Australian flags free of charge to all schools, local councils, churches and other non&hyphen;profit or benevolent community organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of McEwen I have received hundreds of requests for flags from community groups and schools within my electorate since the last election, and also from individuals who have been chosen to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> represent Australia overseas on exchange or study programs. Every time I present an Australian flag to a group in McEwen I am constantly struck by the level of pride shown in our flag, whether it is by older Australians, such as members of the Broadford Senior Citizens' Club, or by a young Australian like Daniel Proud from Nagambie Primary School.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian flag is much more than the Union Jack, the Southern Cross and the Commonwealth Star on a blue background. It is a reflection of our national pride and evokes memories of times when we are uniquely proud to be Australian&mdash;in war, in sport, in great achievements and memorable events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is indeed unfortunate that many people, particularly members of the opposition, have in the past tried to dissect our flag and deem it unsuitable or no longer relevant. I refer in particular to one statement by Senator Chris Schacht who told Channel 9's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> program in 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We haven't yet defined our image of who we are and it is very confusing having a flag which gives pride of place in the top left&hyphen;hand corner to the flag of another country and I think that it is a confusing image anywhere in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>It may be confusing to Senator Schacht and other members of the opposition but it is certainly not confusing to me or to the majority of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost every opinion poll conducted over the past 17 years has shown that a majority of Australians wish to retain the current flag. This overwhelming support for the current flag should be a strong indicator to this government and to future governments that the people should have a direct say in any proposal to change the current Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in my electorate of McEwen agree. During my travels around my electorate, not only to present flags but to attend a multitude of functions, people of all ages have spoken of their love for the current flag and of their desire to be consulted before any changes are made. To give an example, one student from Yarra Glen said to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than any other emblem that captures the nation, I identify with the Australian flag as a symbol which not only represents our past, but one <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8386"> which will carry us through to the next century. I understand that there are people today who question the relevance of the flag or that would seek to include or exclude certain particular aspects. However, I would hesitate to make permanent changes without consulting the body of people which would be most affected&mdash;the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA>Australians were directly involved in the initial search for an Australian flag 95 years ago. Therefore, why should they not be given a say in any move to introduce a new flag? Australians have a right to decide what their greatest national symbol should be. They should not have change forced down their throats just for the sake of change. Our flag does not exist for the convenience of other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia recognises its history in its flag through the Union Jack, just as other countries do. For example, Mexico's flag includes the red of Spain, France's flag includes white for its monarchy, and the state of Hawaii's flag also features the Union Jack despite America's independence from England more than 200 years ago. We cannot ignore our history while, at the same time, we cannot be restrained by it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A flag is the symbol of a nation. It is meant to unite a nation and last throughout the centuries. It is not meant to be a reflection of a country in its present state and change according to the trends of the time. What if another flag were chosen and in 100 years it too was deemed irrelevant. Would it too be cast aside in favour of a more trendy alternative?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is best put by the prominent historian Geoffrey Blainey who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The flags of the world are full of symbols that belong to the past. . . Flags aren't up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date information sheets.</PARA>
<PARA>Without doubt, any move to change the flag without consultation with the Australian public would cause bitter and lasting divisions within the community. There would never be complete acceptance for any new flag and millions of Australians would always resent having any change forced upon them.</PARA>
<PARA>Without doubt, any move to change the flag without consultation with the Australian public would cause bitter and lasting divisions <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> within the community. There would never be complete acceptance for the new flag, and millions of Australians would resent having that change forced upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an article `The Flag: Symbol of our National Identity' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">IPA Review</EMPHASIS> of 1991, Santo Santoro said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any move to change our flag would lead to a lengthy and probably bitter debate, with the potential to exacerbate political divisions, to set newcomer against native&hyphen;born and migrant against migrant. It is unrealistic to imagine that any alternative could command anything like the degree of support for the current Australian flag, particularly after the acrimonious debate which any change is certain to entail.</PARA>
<PARA>While some people claim that the current flag does not do Aboriginal history justice and that true reconciliation cannot take place until the flag is changed, I think we should take note of the Canadian example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Canada adopted its red and white maple leaf flag 25 years ago, it was meant to unite Canada. However, as we all know, problems continue in Canada, culminating in the well-documented attempts of the Quebec separatists. I readily acknowledge that some people object to the Union Jack being in our flag, but I do not believe that that is cause for removing it. We cannot change history by ignoring it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that we have a strong historical tie with Britain and the majority of our population is descended from the British. The Southern Cross is a symbol which unites all Australians. It reflects our position in the world and features in Aboriginal folklore, while the Commonwealth star represents Federation and our birth as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a government to change the flag without consulting the people whom it would most affect would be outrageous. When moves were afoot in the mid&hyphen;1970s to change the national anthem, the Fraser government did not force change upon the people. It put the question to the Australian public in the form of a poll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, Prime Minister Fraser wanted <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS> as our national song, as did our current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), but instead of legislating that change without <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8387"> consultation they left the decision in the hands of Australians. Australians voted for our current anthem, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair</EMPHASIS>. If such a democratic system was good enough for our national anthem, why should our national flag be treated with any less respect?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past 12 years, the coalition has made repeated efforts in parliament to entrench the current flag in legislation and ensure that it cannot be changed without the support of the people. Unfortunately, the Labor Party has thwarted each of these attempts, refusing to support a simple democratic proposition. There can be no justification for changing the existing Australian flag without first receiving majority support from all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our flag is a symbol for all, not just for the government of the day. We have no right to introduce a new flag without consulting the people for whom the flag is flown. This government has acted on its promise to protect our great national symbol, the Australian flag. As our Prime Minister said when he announced the plan on Anzac Day this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will mean that no politician, no political party and no special interest group will be able to tamper with the design of our flag . . . All Australians can be assured that no one will be able to change our national symbol without the nation's consent.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is exactly how it should be, and I commend this bill to the house.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(1.19 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to enter the debate briefly. I want to make a number of points in relation to the matters that have been raised in the course of the debate on the Flags Amendment Bill. The question of national emblems is very important. The right of the people of the nation to determine those national emblems is equally important. That is why I am happy to support this bill, but I think it is important that people realise in that context that some of the historical anecdotes that have been raised today tend to be a little selective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this bill. It gives the Australian people the right to vote on the flag, a right which they have never had before. In the history of this country, people have never before had the opportunity to vote to select the flag that we now fly as the national flag; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nor, for that matter, to select any other flag that they might prefer in its place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) referred to the competition that was run at the turn of the century and the fact that that competition endorsed two flags, a red and a blue ensign. She also referred to the fact that there were five different competitors who basically put forward the same design. One of the interesting things about that is that one of those five was not an Australian at all; he was a New Zealander, a Kiwi. That might explain why our two flags are so similar. As the shadow minister at the table, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), commented to me a little while ago, it has in fact happened in the past at Olympic ceremonies, when Australia has won the medal, that they have hoisted the New Zealand flag. That is a point of confusion which occurs not only at Olympic Games, I might add. Were we to take the New Zealand flag to a number of places in Australia and present it as the Australian flag, I suspect few would be keen enough to notice the difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another interesting link that this flag has with New Zealand, arising from that early competition, is this question about a six&hyphen; or a seven&hyphen;pointed star. We refer to that as signifying the states and territories, but on 4 September 1901 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Argus</EMPHASIS> reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should it ever happen that the people of New Zealand change their mind and decide to enter the union, a very slight alteration would enable the flag still to stand. It will only be necessary to place a seven&hyphen;pointed star instead of a six&hyphen;pointed one beneath the Union Jack.</PARA>
<PARA>The simple fact is that the history of the flag and the history of the star identify that people who are not Australian were involved in its creation. In fact, the thought of a seven&hyphen;pointed star at the time of its adoption in 1901 had to do with New Zealand's involvement as part of the Commonwealth of Australia rather than any consideration that is now attributed to the seven&hyphen;pointed star.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing which I think is important to note is that in the course of the debate a good deal has been said about the flag having been proudly carried by Australian troops in battle, and that is indeed true. But, of course, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8388"> it is not the only flag that Australian troops have carried into battle since Federation. During the First World War it was just as common for Australians to fight under the red ensign as it was to fight under the blue ensign. Indeed, it was just as common for them to fight under the British flag as it was to fight under either of those two Australian flags. Even in the Second World War, many Australian troops fighting in Australian formations fought not under the blue ensign but under the red ensign. My father, who served in New Guinea, served in a unit which fought under the red ensign. There is any number of ex&hyphen;service personnel and records that will attest to that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why do we have the blue ensign today as our national flag? It is not because the people of Australia had a vote on it. They did not in 1901, and they have not since. The reason we have the Australian flag as a blue ensign is that a group of politicians in the Australian parliament in 1953 legislated to make it so. In other words, the high ground, principled position that I have heard so many members in this chamber, particularly from the government side, espouse about the terrible evil of allowing politicians to determine this matter has glossed over the fact that it was precisely that mechanism that arrived at the current flag as our national flag. The process that has been denigrated is precisely the process which was used in adopting the current flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said at the outset that I support these changes, and I do, because I think it is important that the people of the country do have the right to determine these matters. But let us get some modicum of balance into this debate and let us understand that the flag we have today was never adopted by the Australian people. We are quite properly giving that authority to the Australian people today, but we need to be realistic and honest about the past and we need to be honest about the flag we have today. It is important, and it is an important symbol of our nation, but let us be honest in recounting on the record here in the parliament exactly how it came to be our national emblem. It was not adopted by the people; it was not arrived at by decision of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians alone. The seven&hyphen;pointed star was not something that was intended to accommodate territories; it was intended to accommodate New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that the flag is confusing in other parts of the world when Australians winning a gold medal at the Olympics have stood under the New Zealand flag. As the country moves forward into its second century of nationhood, we as a nation might have a mature debate both about the real history of the development of our emblems but, more importantly, what it is we see for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren as the enduring emblem for them into the future of a unique Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(1.25 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today in the debate on this very significant Flags Amendment Bill to make a contribution not only as Minister for Veterans' Affairs but also as the member for Maranoa. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the link that my portfolio has with the ex&hyphen;service community. I have listened with great interest to speakers on both sides of the parliament. Whilst I understand that the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and the other side are supporting this bill, he did seem to be hedging his bets a little in suggesting that we need to have a mature debate about this. That probably underlies a lot of opinion on the other side of the House. They would like to change our flag by suggesting we need to have a mature debate about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wherever I have travelled since becoming the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I have found that the ex&hyphen;service community have no doubts in their minds as to the support they give to our Australian flag. It has always been important to the services of this nation. It is an issue that is raised with me constantly. When I raise the issue in terms of this amendment bill they break into spontaneous applause. It is a measure of the support that we have out there in the ex&hyphen;service community for this amendment bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another event to look back on is the very successful Australia Remembers celebrations last year on the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War. To see <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8389"> people, young and old, lining the streets of our small country towns and our cities, waving our Australian flag so proudly, demonstrates to us all in this parliament and to legislators around this nation that the people of Australia, overwhelmingly, support the flag we have. The celebrations last year that we saw in our streets during the celebrations which marked the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War are ones that all members of parliament should hark back to. They were about the grassroots people of Australia demonstrating in a very meaningful way their support for our flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to touch on the pilgrimage that I made this year to Vietnam, along with the shadow minister, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who I acknowledge played a very important role in that pilgrimage to Vietnam, because it is very much linked with our flag and the ex&hyphen;service community's support for the military presence and the fact that they fought under our Australian flag. As I travelled with those Vietnam veterans and the widows of veterans who fought in Vietnam, that moment that I stood with them at a service at Nui Dat, where our task force headquarters were, gave me a much greater understanding of the price that was paid by so many hundreds of thousands of Australians who paid the supreme sacrifice defending freedom around the world and fighting for our flag. It just means so much to those people. The price that was paid really struck me as I stood at that small service on 18 August this year at Nui Dat in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who have served this country in times of war and conflict, and for those who stand ready to serve it today&mdash;and that is important; they stand to serve it should they be needed&mdash;our flag is a very special symbol to them. It symbolises what they are fighting for. It also symbolises where they have come from and where they have been and where they are going, and when we think back through the annals of military history it has never been any other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look back at the great recruitment marches that used to come through rural Australia into our capital cities. There is an excellent exhibition down at the National Library on the First <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> World War. The exhibition contains some of the memorabilia associated with the marches and with fighting `For king and country: follow the flag', as it is called. It is a very good exhibition. The brochure which I have with me here in the House demonstrates that the flag has always been part of military history and has been so very important to our nation as a whole. One of the many publications on the history of our flag describes it like this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The flag was carried into New Guinea at the outbreak of World War I by the naval and military force which captured the German colonies, by the cruiser <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>  in the first naval battle of the war, by the ANZACs who landed at Gallipoli and by the `diggers' who spearheaded the victories in France in 1917&hyphen;18. It was seen around the world again in World War II. When Singapore was retaken in 1945, the first flag to fly was an Australian ensign made secretly in a prison camp.</PARA>
<PARA>I also had the great privilege last year of attending the 80th anniversary commemorative celebrations in Turkey, and I attended on Anzac Day at Gallipoli. I was at Anzac Cove for that dawn service. I still remember&mdash;it is a very vivid memory&mdash;the people who attended that very small but very significant service on Anzac Day last year. Many young people, Australian and New Zealander backpackers, made their way out of their holidays to Turkey and then to Gallipoli for Anzac Day. To see them waving the Australian flag is another demonstration by the young people of Australia of their support for our Australian flag and what it means to them. They were clearly taking time out of a European holiday to be on Anzac Day at Anzac Cove in Gallipoli.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were associating themselves not only with our flag but also with our history right back to Gallipoli and that first landing at Gallipoli. I believe most Australians feel that a lot of the Australian psyche and the Australian character were born on those beaches at Gallipoli.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The achievements have really been marked by the planting, or the raising, of the flag. Troops for so long have fought under flags. Those who have lost their lives have been buried with their flag. Victories have been celebrated with many flags.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8390">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of the flag in military encounters is emphasised by Dr C.E.W. Bean's history of the First World War. With reference to the operations to capture Passchendaele on 17 October, Dr Bean writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only one Australian division, the 3RD, was wholly employed in this day's offensive. But that division was to capture Passchendaele, and, in spite of the depressing conditions, it was eager to achieve the distinction of doing so. One unit carried an Australian flag, to be planted in Passchendaele, and the Commander&hyphen;in&hyphen;Chief had been informed and had told General Monash, that, when this flag was planted, the news would be immediately cabled to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>From Dr C.E.W. Bean's history again, I quote the words of Lieutenant Rollings in France in 1918:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enemy infantry surrendering very freely. Have sent scores back and killed scores, others running away. Enemy artillery nil. Have toured round Framerville and upset all their transport etc. Australian flag hoisted at 11.15 on German Corps HQ.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>These men fought with the flag, they fought for the flag, and the job was not done till the flag was hoisted. The views of the ex&hyphen;service community are very strong on the issue of our national flag. They express it quite simply. They fought for everything symbolised by our flag. It united them, at times it comforted them, and always it inspired them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue we are addressing here is not the design of our flag. It is not a logo or brand or natty marketing device designed to win favour of a particular target market. It is a symbol for all Australians, for all that is good about being Australian. We should not be concerned with the merit or otherwise of the design of our flag, although personally I am very firmly of the view that our flag is not only a very beautiful flag but also very inspiring. It is a highly emotive flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue, quite clearly, is that our flag, and all that it symbolises, is far too important to be subject to change by political whim. Our flag means what it does because the people of this country have believed in it. It has been a constant in times of war, in conflict, in turmoil, in disaster and in depression, reminding us all of the freedom and equality and hope and opportunity that characterises this great nation of ours.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been contributions made about the linking of our Australian flag to great sporting events, whether it is on the football field or at the Olympic Games or the Commonwealth Games. So often in the sporting arenas we see people linking themselves to the Australian flag because of what the Australian flag means to them. It is a symbol. It is a national symbol. To see athletes at the Olympic Games proudly collecting an Australian flag and draping it around their shoulders and doing a victory lap of an arena or of a swimming stadium clearly demonstrates that it is a national symbol and one that should not be tampered with. It should only be through the united will of the Australian people that change should come about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this legislation does. It ensures that change can only come about through the will of the people, not a political party or an individual. That is why I am so pleased to be here at the dispatch box today supporting this amendment bill. It is a further demonstration that we are carrying out what we said to the people before 2 March. We said that, if we were given the mandate by the people of Australia, we would introduce legislation that would ensure that the flag could only be changed by the people and not by a political party or by an individual. We are now delivering on yet another of the promises that we gave to the people of Australia before 2 March.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;May I thank everyone who has participated in the debate on the Flags Amendment Bill. The fact that we had such an exceptionally large number of members contribute to this debate really demonstrates that this chamber has a respect for the flag and, indeed, indicates the respect of the Australian community as a whole for the Australian national flag.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased that we are facing this debate in a bipartisan way because the Flags Act, when it was passed in 1953, also received bipartisan support. Similar support for this bill will demonstrate to the people of Australia the principle that we, their elected representatives, have no intention of usurping their most important national symbol, their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8391"> flag, the flag of our nation. The Australian national flag should not be changed without a vote of the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can turn to a point that was raised in the debate by a number of members, particularly by the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) in his speech, where the constitutional validity of this legislation was contested. Some members opposite have suggested that the bill may lack validity because it attempts to construct a different legislative power to section 1 of the constitution. That section, of course, vests legislative power in the federal parliament consisting of the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives and they thought this might have happened by the inclusion of the Australian people in the above legislature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I assure members that the government is satisfied that the bill as drafted is constitutionally valid. The member for Reid also&mdash;I thought quite mischievously&mdash;sought to raise doubts as to whether, if a vote for a new flag does occur, there would be any significance in the way the votes are counted. The explanatory memorandum and the bill are quite clear, and I restate it for the sake of clarity: a new flag can be adopted if and only if a majority of all electors voting nationally vote for a new flag. The government's intention is that any vote on whether to adopt a new flag shall be on the basis of a national vote counted on a national basis. It does not matter how the majority view stacks up in the various states and the territories. The government believes that the choice of a national flag is not one which affects the balance of power between the Commonwealth and the states, as may occur with a change to the constitution. Rather, it goes to the issue of how we express our national identity, which is a decision for the will of the Australian people acting as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Reid and the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) drew attention to the fact that the bill makes no provision for variations to the flag should the Northern Territory become a state. The Commonwealth star has consisted of seven points since 1908&mdash;one point for each of the states and the seventh point to represent all of Australia's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> territories. The Commonwealth star is an integral part of the flag. In fact, it is a national symbol of significance in its own right. Its symbolism has been widely adopted in Commonwealth heraldry, as it formed part of the original Commonwealth coat of arms granted in 1908 and the present arms granted in 1912. It is found in the insignia of many of the elements of the Australian system of honours and awards, and one example of this is on the uniforms of the Australian Federal Police. The government's position is quite clear: given the significance of the Commonwealth star, the Australian people should also be consulted before any change is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of concern was raised under section 8 of the Flags Act. Some of the opposition members oppose the retention of section 8 of the Flags Act, which states that nothing in the Flags Act affects the right or privilege of a person to fly the Union Jack. Clause 8 has no bearing on the bill's objective, which is to ensure that the Australian people alone approve a new national flag. There is absolutely nothing in the Flags Act or this bill which prevents people from flying, subject to flag protocol, any Australian flag or, frankly, the flag of any nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In her speech, the member for Prospect suggested that the government had failed to act on the concerns of many Australians that thousands of British subjects who are not yet Australian citizens would be eligible to vote on whether or not to change the flag. She has not, however, urged such a course herself. I think she is probably too experienced for that. In 1981 the Commonwealth and the states agreed that Australian citizenship should be the basis of the right to vote in Australian federal and state elections but that non-Australian citizens who already enjoyed the vote should retain it. These persons included citizens not only of the United Kingdom but of nearly 50 members of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Republic of Ireland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is about enfranchising all elements of the Australian community in decisions about the national flag. Frankly, the government is not interested in proposals to disenfranchise certain groups of people from this decision. The government believes that all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8392"> persons who have the right to vote should be entitled to do so at federal, state and territory elections and at constitutional referenda and to vote, if need be, on the national flag. Once again, may I thank all those members who took part in this rather long debate, and I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This migration legislation, as I indicated previously, shows that the government believes that migrants are second&hyphen;class citizens. It is an attack on fundamental family values and a repudiation of the coalition's pre&hyphen;election commitments. I want to draw the attention of the House to the statements made by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) when he was the opposition spokesman on immigration when amendments were made to the Migration Act to make it plain that a minister could not cap visas. The present immigration minister, when he was opposition spokesman, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through the year, `We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia&mdash;no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents.'  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups.</PARA>
<PARA>They were his words in opposition. Yet what he is proposing with this legislation is precisely that. He is giving himself the power to say, `We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia&mdash;no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, no more aged parents.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is little wonder that in the Senate we saw a report concerning the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 which endorsed the many fears and concerns raised in submissions from church groups, from the Human Rights Commissioner, from the Australian Law Reform Commission and from others that what this legislation, amongst other things, would do is, firstly, breach Australia's international obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child; secondly, represent a significant withdrawal from Australia's lawful commitment to the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Sex Discrimination; thirdly, increase the potential for corruption; and, finally, it would be an admission that the government's proposed legislation would be discriminatory and would breach Australia's international undertakings. Those are the concerns that have been expressed by people in the community who are aware of the provisions of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be said very clearly that this bill is not about levels of migration. We in opposition have made it clear on a number of occasions that we have no argument with the government about the size of the program that it announced for 1996&hyphen;97. The minister went to some pains in his media release at the time he announced the program to say that the size was about the average of the last four years of the Labor government&mdash;and, indeed, it is. But that fact makes a lie of the cries that Labor allowed the immigration program to get out of control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8393"> It is also important to note there was no hint of the coalition's cry about Labor allowing the program to get out of control during the election campaign&mdash;not at all. In fact, the coalition committed itself specifically in giving priority to family reunion&mdash;as com pared with what it is trying to do now&mdash;within a program of a similar size to that which Labor had managed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the statements made by government members during this and other debates on migrants and race have been described by one commentator in the broader debate as `dog whistling'. That is, the message is coded and pitched at a certain frequency to which a particular audience will be attuned but it can be denied whenever necessary. It is most regrettable that some government members have indulged in this practice, endeavouring to send out what are effectively coded, racist messages to those in the community who are receptive to such messages. I think most members of the House would reject that sort of approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should also be noted that some government members have claimed that the power to cap these visa levels was put in place by the previous government. That is not the case. If that power exists at all under the current legal framework, it would certainly give rise to legal contention and controversy and would require some implementation of regulations to accompany it. We need to put on record that no government previously explored the existence of such a provision or sought to cap the number of spouse, aged parent and dependent child visas that can be granted in any one year. So let there be no mistake that capping the spouse visa has nothing to do with immigration as such.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It means that Australians will not have the right to choose to marry the love of their life. That will be restricted by the government setting a number of spouse visas that can be issued each year. So, if you make that decision early in the life of the program and visas are still around, you can be in luck, but too bad if you meet that person or make that decision later in the visa cycle. The answer may well be, `Sorry, no more visas for spouses this year. Try again next year. Better luck next year.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, that right to meet the responsibility of caring for our elderly parents&mdash;one which until now we have taken for granted&mdash;will be denied as well. The minister wants the power to say to Australians&mdash;citizens and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> permanent residents alike&mdash;that if their parents happen to live overseas only some will be able to meet that responsibility this year, and the same applies for dependent children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his second reading speech on the bill, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs said this is crucial to restoring public confidence in immigration which had been greatly eroded under Labor and that Labor had allowed immigration to get seriously out of control; yet when in opposition the same minister said that it would be unconscionable for a government to say midway through the year, `We have enough spouses in now. We will close off that category. No&hyphen;one else will be allowed in this year.' So the minister's comments in opposition and his comments now are absolutely inconsistent and ought to be shown up as hypocrisy and pre&hyphen;election rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also add our strong opposition to the introduction of the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill to roll the existing migration charges into one. The visa application fee will rise by over 250 per cent, the English education charge will go up by nearly 250 per cent&mdash;and there is the health services charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, the English education charge increases are not acceptable to the opposition. Learning English is very much a part of the resettlement process. It is absolutely essential for people who have been granted the right to make this country their home under the claim of our non-discriminatory migration policy to be able to learn English. I draw the attention of the House to the coalition's policy description of English as `the glue of a cohesive nation'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what are the coalition doing here? They want to raise the charge to $5,500 per person, thereby making it unaffordable to many. This plainly will discriminate against non-English speaking applicants. Also, it is completely inconsistent with that survey to which I have previously pointed that indicates most coalition MPs, most coalition candidates, regard the ability or capacity to speak English as an essential part of being truly Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the opposition opposes the increases to the English education charge. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8394"> government has rolled all these into one bill. They have refused to separate them out to enable the opposition to support those parts of this bill which we do not disagree with. It seems to me that, in so doing, they are playing politics with this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me further draw the attention of the House to what has happened in my own electorate as a result of the government's mismanagement of the migration program. A constituent who is a permanent resident engaged to a woman from Pakistan applied for a visa under the prospective spouse category. The government's decision to require sponsors to be Australian citizens rather than permanent residents saw that application rejected. But the Senate, in turn, defeated that unfair measure with the result that the constituent's fiancee can apply again, more certain that the application will be approved, but another application fee must be coughed up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, a constituent who is a permanent resident seeking to bring her 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Fijian son to Australia submitted her application, along with the necessary fee for which she had saved. She was quite confused and angry when told by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that her application had failed because she is not an Australian citizen. Before June and after October this would not have been a problem. But the bungled manner in which the government sought to amend the provision means that she too will have to line up with another application and another application fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government has done in relation to migration and what it is doing with the bill before the House do this nation's reputation no good in the eyes of prospective migrants who are confused and angry and who deserve a better explanation. This is typical of the way in which the Liberal Party has been treating migrants. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996, the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996 and the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill 1996. Unlike the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), I believe that this legisla <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tion is in the very best interests of the current population of Australia, our newest arrivals and those who wish to become Australian citizens in the future. These amendments are necessary if our government is to achieve a migrant intake which balances family, skill levels and humanitarian considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Helsinki accords assert a universal right of immigration. However, there is no international disagreement about a government's right to determine who should be admitted to their country, at what rate, who should be granted citizenship and how many. There are fundamental moral and human rights issues associated with any immigration policy, true; and, yes, it is a fact that an individual's opportunities in life are profoundly affected by the lottery of their birth. Quite obviously, an infant born today in Zaire will have an entirely different life experience compared with that of an infant born on this same day in Canberra&mdash;and, of course, we would have to agree that that sounds unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we cannot and do not live in an ideal world. All resources of every nation are finite. The argument in favour of national sovereignty control over immigration is commonsense. Anything else threatens the wellbeing of the host population and, in particular, the most vulnerable&mdash;the most recently arrived, the immigrants in the host nation. It is not surprising then that all governments carefully try to formulate and implement migration policies in an effort to protect their border security, economic wellbeing, political stability and cultural identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, these amendments are important in that they give to our Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs the ability to control our incoming numbers to ensure that the future economic and social wellbeing of all Australians is protected. The tools are necessary as a part of our forward planning so that we can deliver on our migrant intake policies. Australia, along with other countries like the USA and Israel, has been built on wave upon wave of migration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it not a fact that today's employment data confirms the dreadful employment trend since the budget with employment growth only half that is needed to achieve the moderate budget forecast and predictions of an increase in unemployment in 1997 to over nine per cent? Does the government still stand by the moderate budget forecasts on employment? If not, what action is the cabinet unemployment committee taking to ensure that unemployment goes down, not up as predicted?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Batman for his question. Can I say to the House that the unemployment data that was released today showed that employment grew by 24,000, unemployment fell by 31,700 and the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage points to 8.5 per cent. I remember that, when I was asked a question a month ago in relation to the previous figures, which from recollection had gone in the other direction, I said it was unwise to place too much reliance on one month's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> figures. I say the same thing of today's figures. I think it is always unwise&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would counsel the member for Batman and also the member for Hotham not to place too much reliance on one month's figures. I make the point that the level of unemployment indicated by these figures is the lowest since July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But whatever may be the interpretations that either side of politics would seek to place on these figures, can I make a couple of points. The first is that, if we want intelligent debate on unemployment in this country, we should stop making exaggerated claims in either direction about particular figures. I did not give a doom and gloom response to the figures a month ago. I am not today going to make an exaggerated claim because there has been a pleasing break in the other direction&mdash;it is a break, I must say, that was against some of the predictions. It does show a very solid employment growth. I mean, 24,000 at this time of the year is solid growth and I hope it can be continued. But, as the honourable member for Batman will know, these figures are notoriously unpredictable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I make is that reducing unemployment is something that will only be achieved over time. The best advice available to me is that the budget predictions in their various areas are on track. In relation to those predictions, I can only repeat the advice that I have received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take the opportunity to remind the House of a number of measures taken by the government which we believe will strengthen the employment outlook for Australians. We have put in place a fiscal consolidation strategy. We have seen significant reductions in interest rates. The combination of a cut in interest rates and better than expected employment figures on the eve of Christmas will boost consumer confidence. Boosting consumer confidence is a good thing for the economy because there is a psychological element involved in economic recovery. It is not all statistics. There is an element of psychology. The combination of a cut in interest rates and better than expected employment figures ought to be seen by all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8396"> Australians as unambiguously good news on the eve of Christmas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the passage of the workplace relations bill will create more productive workplaces with higher productivity underpinning higher real wages. We have introduced a number of measures to help small business: the provisional tax uplift factor; the very generous changes to the fringe benefits tax regime; the abolition of the unfair dismissal law; and the injection from 1 January next year of an additional $1 billion of spending via the family tax initiative&mdash;all of these things together will work to produce a higher level of confidence and a greater disposition on the part of consumers to spend. I believe the lower interest rate climate will induce a greater desire on the part of people to invest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I finish the answer by saying, again, that I welcome these figures. They are good figures; they are not bad figures. They are a cause of feeling positive. But I say, as I did with figures that were commensurately less welcoming a month ago, nobody with any real understanding of this situation should place too much reliance on one month's figures. On both sides of the House I think there should be an absence of extravagant language and a willingness to understand that only over time can employment be boosted and unemployment reduced.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government warmly welcomes the passage through the Senate of the Telstra sale legislation. It will be the law of Australia when the legislation is proclaimed that one-third of Telstra can be sold into public ownership. This heralds a new era in the involvement of the Australian public in the direct ownership of the great utilities of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interesting things about privatisation is that the critics of privatisation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have suggested that it represents selling a public asset. I see it in exactly an opposite light. I see it as giving the members of the public an opportunity to buy public assets. What is going to happen is that tens of thousands of Australians, for the first time, are going to have an opportunity to invest in Telstra. I can predict now that they will, I believe, support the sale of one-third of Telstra very strongly. This is going to generate enormous public interest. It is going to generate enormous public support. I predict that, when the float takes place, the measure of support from mainstream Australia will be such that those who opposed the sale of Telstra will want to forget that they did that very silly thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Very importantly, I want to assure the parliament, in particular the member for Capricornia, that as well as the general public being able to participate in buying shares in the Telstra float we are going to make special arrangements for the employees of Telstra. The workers involved in Telstra will get a special deal in the public float. We are reserving two per cent of the one-third float especially for Telstra employees. There are going to be special measures to encourage those employees and their families to acquire shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under a generous employee share ownership plan, a special offer of one free share for every four shares purchased will be made to Telstra employees with a maximum of 500 free shares per employee. In addition, there will be very generous loyalty bonuses available to Telstra employees who hold their shares in Telstra for at least 12 months. Telstra has already been made fully aware of this employee share ownership plan which was announced by the coalition before the election and which I confirm today. Full details of this generous priority allocation to Telstra employees will be announced with the public release of all details about the one-third float.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again that the sale of one-third of Telstra will be a bonanza for the average Australian. It will be an opportunity for the average Australian to buy directly into one of the great public utilities of Australia. It will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8397"> represent a new partnership which will involve the average Australian in the ownership, the development, the expansion and the full reach of telecommunications technology to all parts of Australia.

All of commerce is extraordinarily interested in those moves. It will generate interest. That has been measured by the increase in consumer confidence by the bank indexes.

Seriously, I think the appointment of Mr Djerrkura is one of the more important appointments that has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8398"> been made by the government. I had the opportunity today of meeting and congratulating all of the new members of the ATSIC board. I think something like 13 of the 19 are newly elected. There are under the legislation two appointments made by the government&mdash;the chairman and Mr Dillon, who is a well&hyphen;known and well respected member of the Queensland Police Force and who has risen to a very high rank in that police force. I believe both men will bring very great talents and particular capacities to the work of ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Djerrkura is extremely well qualified for the job. He is a senior tribal man of the Wangurri people in the north&hyphen;east of Arnhem Land. He is very aware of the importance of traditional indigenous culture and also the problems facing indigenous people in remote areas of Australia. As general manager of a business enterprise of a contracting company for the Nabalco bauxite mine on the Gove Peninsula and the employer of some 60 indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous people, he is very aware of the importance of economic independence for Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I met the members of the board today, I took the opportunity of making two points in particular. I pointed out the desire of the government to work in a very constructive fashion with the ATSIC board and that, naturally, when there is a change of government goals are sometimes pursued in different ways, but it does not mean that the goal of a far more equitable treatment of indigenous people and the redressing of lack of advantage and disadvantage will not be just as steadfastly pursued by the new government as it may have been pursued by former governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I assured Mr Djerrkura and the ATSIC board of the goodwill of the government towards the indigenous people of Australia. Our commitment to the reconciliation process is quite steadfast. I also expressed concern to the members of the board&mdash;although I do not profess to have an instant answer to the problem&mdash;about the continuing high level of deaths in custody. This is an issue that I think concerns all Australians. It is a direct consequence of the high incarceration rate of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indigenous people which, in turn, I think everybody will agree is a consequence of their deprived social circumstances, the absence of sound family and community structures and the alienation that many young people, black and white, feel within our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, I did not pretend to the ATSIC board that I had an instant solution to that&mdash;I do not think anybody does&mdash;but I did undertake that that would be something that would concern and preoccupy the government. I hope that over time some proposals to which the government is giving consideration can be put forth in that area, which I hope will be of some benefit. I very warmly welcome Mr Djerrkura to the board of ATSIC. I wish him and the other members of the ATSIC board well. I again assure him and the indigenous people of Australia of the goodwill of the government and our desire to work in a very constructive fashion with the members of the ATSIC board, naturally doing things differently from our predecessors but no less steadfastly pursuing the goal of greater justice, better treatment and certainly greater economic independence for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first part of the question is no and the answer to the second part of the question is no. The third part of the question was whether ordinary Australians will lose by handing back responsibility to the states. What we are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8399"> trying to do is rather important. It is prefaced on the assumption that how things are at the moment is working. The simple fact is that, if you wanted to pick an area of the federation where it was not working, you would probably pick health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty with having two governments involved is that you get problems at the boundaries and you do not get sensible decisions being made. A very good example is what happens in Western Australia with palliative care. Western Australia probably has the best home based care service anywhere in Australia, provided by a group called Silver Chain. Silver Chain can provide palliative care for an average cost of about $50 per person per day in the last weeks of someone's life, even applying up to six hours of one&hyphen;on&hyphen;one care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 80 per cent of people who are dying would prefer to die at home. You have to ask yourself: if the majority of people who are dying would like to die at home, and if that can be provided for about $50 a day, why on earth are people still dying in state public hospitals? The simple answer is that the states pay for hospital care and the Commonwealth pays for palliative care, largely through the home and community care program&mdash;and the two cannot get together. In fact, in 1994 Silver Chain found 4,500 public hospital bed days where the only reason someone had gone to die in a public hospital at $500 a day was that the amount of money they were allowed to spend on palliative care had run out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sort of thing that happens when you have two levels of government that do not have any capacity for flexibility in boundary programs. So trying to sort out roles and responsibilities between the Commonwealth and state is driven by no more than trying to provide better and more flexible services to the public. Another good example is aged care, where we can give someone a nursing home bed at $32,000 a year but we cannot give someone $2,500 of continence aids to help their family keep them at home. This is very significant when so many people who <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are frail aged and could be in a nursing home are being looked after at home by their relatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the sorts of things that drive the issue of trying to rationalise the roles and responsibilities in health, no more than that. Things can go wrong, as you found when you handed over immunisation to the states in 1987. That was a disaster. What went wrong then was that it was handed over without any responsibility. It was handed over without any monitoring. It was handed over and forgotten. I can assure you that anything we do in terms of roles and responsibilities will not be our just vacating the field; it will be our trying to rationalise how we can do things better and meet people's needs better.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I imagine that most members of the House would have seen press reports of the survey into women's safety which was published yesterday. The survey was carried out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and I believe that it has provided us with the first comprehensive national data on the extent and the nature of violence against women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It records a number of sobering facts. One of those is that women are far more likely by a factor of four to one to suffer violence as they go about their lives than are men. I am sure that it provides all members of this House with the opportunity to express their personal repugnance at any kind of violence <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8400"> in our society and, because of the greater danger that women suffer in relation to violence, particularly their repugnance in relation to any acts of violence against women and children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is necessary to recognise that, although the great bulk of the community shares the view that I have expressed, there remains a minority who regard violence against women, particularly where there is a close domestic relationship, be it married or otherwise, as something quite different from violence of a random kind against another member of the community. That is an attitude that needs to be changed and I would imagine&mdash;in fact, I am confident&mdash;that there would be bipartisan support in this parliament for such a statement of attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some comments have been made, both by way of interjection and in news reports this morning, that decisions that the federal government has taken in respect of legal aid sit oddly with any concern about the incidence of violence against women.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member rightly pointed out in his question, this is a question which, in normal circumstances, would be directed to the Minister for Trade. But as my colleagues pointed out, in light of the length of the question, I was able to go through the minister's folder and find the appropriate answer on the Chinese anti&hyphen;dumping matter. I can tell the House&mdash;since you seem to be, for reasons which are almost totally incomprehensible, linking this to the DIFF issue&mdash;that the Minister for Trade discussed this issue with Madam Wu Yi, China's minister for foreign trade and economic cooperation, when he met her in Beijing in September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Trade asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to review the issue to ensure our policies were still appropriate. Over a period of nearly two decades, China has clearly undergone profound economic reform and structural change in its transition from a centrally planned economy to a more market based system. Two cases which have come up recently&mdash;one concerning laminated glass and the other glyphosate acid&mdash;have provided an opportunity to scrutinise the prevailing market situation for those industries in China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian Customs officials visited China in October to undertake two in&hyphen;country investigations on these products. They found that in these specific instances they had not identified any recent instances of dumping.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Prime Minister has already said, the government welcomes the fact that the labour force figures for November show an increase of 24,400 in the number of jobs created for the month. That also follows on from a similar increase of 25,500 jobs created in the month of October. The Prime Minister noted that the series is a volatile series. However, taking the two months together, that is 50,000 new jobs in the last two months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget forecast was for two per cent employment growth throughout the year. For the September quarter the growth was half a per cent, which was right on target for the annual rate, and, of course, the contributions for the last two months will add to the number of jobs created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Growth remains solid in the Australian economy with 0.8 per cent growth in GDP in the September quarter&mdash;3.8 per cent for the year. The national accounts were consistent with budget forecasts showing continued strong growth in business investment, which was up eight per cent in the September quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Bureau of Statistics' capital expenditure survey reinforced the view of strong growth in business investment through 1996-97. The fourth set of expectations is almost 20 per cent higher than the relevant estimate last year and around eight per cent higher than the third estimate for 1996. There are good prospects for a pick&hyphen;up in the dwelling sector during 1996-97, suggesting that this will improve conditions in construction and manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Low inflation in the Australian economy, with the CPI rising only 2.1 per cent over the year to September, and national accounts measures showing even more positive signs for low inflation, has enabled a series of reductions in official interest rates, the third of which was yesterday&mdash;allowing a reduction of 1.5 per cent in official interest rates since the election, coupled with reductions in mortgage rates fuelled by competition. Housing standard mortgage variable rates are now the lowest they have been since June 1974, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8402"> lowest home mortgage rates for 22 years. For home buyers in Australia on an average mortgage, they are now $188 per month better off as a result of the reduction of those interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see an emerging picture which is consistent with the budget forecasts. Of course, we will be doing a mid-year review and releasing that in early January. We are seeing a picture consistent with solid growth, low inflation, good investment and reducing interest rates. We have seen opportunities in relation to the housing sector for next year and conditions which are protecting the position for families and home buyers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am delighted to be able to inform the House that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8404"> government and the Australian Democrats have reached agreement on the provider number legislation to ensure its passage through the Senate. In doing so, I have taken on board a number of concerns that the Australian Democrats had to enable the smooth transition of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were four principal concerns. One is that general practice training be extended from four to an optional six years to give people guaranteed time off for family or other reasons. I have agreed to this. The second is that there be an oversight mechanism to have a look at the implementation of the proposal. We have agreed to institute a medical training review panel. That can, in an open and transparent way, examine this implementation over the next couple of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third is that I have agreed to a sunset clause. The program will be reviewed after five years. Fourthly, I have agreed that there be a one-off additional 250 places available in rural areas for doctors who are not able to find a training position or a job. This will be administered through a register of medical opportunity and, again, will mean that there is no reason any medical student or young doctor need have concern about not being able to get training or a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also means that the government can deliver on its three original aims of this legislation. The first is that we want to have better qualified GPs, which is in the Australian public's interest. Secondly, we want to have more doctors in country areas, which has been a chronic feature of the Australian health system in the past. Rural people have the right to have access to medical services. Thirdly, it contains growth in expenditure on MBS items. In this respect, the changes will be met out of the implementation costs which were already counted for so the net effect to the budget bottom line is zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This fits in with what we undertook to do before the last election&mdash;that is, to improve the position of general practice. There have been a number of reports in recent years that have shown the parlous and difficult state that general practice in Australia is in. Peter Baume concluded in a work force study that general practice has been progressively <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deskilled over the last 30 years. Bob Douglas from the ANU showed in research last year that a third of Australia's doctors would leave work tomorrow if there was something else they could do. This is very disturbing news for our basic, primary health care delivery service in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package will help the status and quality of general practice. It will mean that general practice no longer has to be the dumping ground for the entire medical profession. It builds on our budget initiatives whereby we reversed a decision prior to the election to take $400 million out of the better practice program. It builds on a decision whereby we have made general practice the centrepiece of coordinated care. As a result of that, 14 trials are now under way around Australia with the full support of divisions of general practice. It also builds on our decision to change referral mechanisms whereby general practitioners have to be the persons to whom specialists come back to so that someone can be the focus of patient care. All in all, it is good for the bush, it is good for general practice and it is good for the Australian public.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for her question. I am aware that on Melbourne radio on Monday of this week the Leader of the Opposition indicated that the government's motivation for the partial sale of Telstra was based on ideology. The Leader of the Opposition continues to attack the government on privatisation. Since coming to office, it is this government that has completed the third stage of the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. It is this government that has completed the issuing of the loyalty shares, the completion of the Qantas sale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who was it that was responsible for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the sale of Qantas? It was the now Leader of the Opposition in his former capacity. He was an enthusiastic supporter of privatisation in the past. It was the Leader of the Opposition who led the charge. It was the Leader of the Opposition who was a key player in the privatisation efforts of the former government. It was the Leader of the Opposition, from the right wing of the party, who stood against the ideology that came forward from the left wing of the party when it came to the sale of various assets by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason he did this was that he was convinced of the merits of privatisation. As early as 1990 he was prepared to stand up in this House and be counted on asset sales. He indicated, in endeavouring to justify the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ditching of the ALP's policy on the sale of Australian Airlines, that there was a reason for Australian Airlines to be sold. He said at that time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we think that there are other things that ought to be done in the public sector with injections of capital that would be capable of being implemented were Australian taken out of it.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat, `other things that ought to be done with injections of public capital'. What, for example? Does this include the repayment of debt? Does it include the best environmental package that this nation has ever seen? Back then you were gung-ho in respect of the privatisation, the sale, of government assets. You were a supporter at that time. You saw the benefits of privatisation. You said such words in that debate as `more competitive markets' and `freeing up our public entities to act in a commercial manner'. You now attack us for wanting to put public capital to better use, particularly when there is private capital to replace it; and that is the case with Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the hypocrisy! It is all right for the Labor Party to sell off $5 billion worth of assets. It is all right to put your collective hands on your hearts and say, `We won't sell the CBA, we won't sell Qantas, we won't sell Australian Airlines', but you simply sold them. We had the courage to go to the Australian people and say, `We will sell Telstra.' We had the courage to say what the public benefit of using the capital of Telstra would be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. It is a very important question, particularly at this time of the year. Last year, 1995, some 2,017 people were killed on Australia's roads, some 30,000 people were seriously injured, and some 90,000 people sustained minor injuries. This is an improvement over previous years. In 1985 there were nearly 3,000 people killed on our roads. So we have been able to make some improvement to the road toll. This is shown up in a host of areas. It is worth noting that our road trauma costs Australia some $6,100 million per annum. So it is not only an enormous emotional and social cost to the country but also a substantial economic cost to Australia's economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government is doing everything it can to try to reduce the road toll. Over the last 10 years, on average, some 60 people per year have been killed on the Pacific Highway, one of the worst roads in Australia. We have announced a $3,100 million funding package, in partnership with both the New South Wales and Queensland governments, to upgrade that road to a dual carriageway four&hyphen;lane standard. That is something that should have been done many years ago. We think that will reduce the road fatalities on that section of the highway by something in the order of 85 per cent, if past experience is any judge for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also announced a new black spots road funding program, which has been financed to the tune of $149 million. That will see some 400 projects undertaken each year identifying our worst accident sites around Australia. Going from past experience, that should save something in the order of 72 lives each year. We have also embarked on a national and rural road safety action plan, which is targeting specific groups in our society that are more likely to be involved in motor accidents, and therefore trying to educate them about avoiding those motor accidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This week all members will receive a road safety kit, coming from the Department of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Transport and Regional Development. That road safety kit will provide information to all members as to how they can participate in a national education program for the Christmas holiday period, designed to reduce the road toll.

This road safety kit is designed to try to reduce that number of fatalities during the Christmas&hyphen;New Year period. I would urge all members of parliament to take up the opportunities presented to them through the provision of this kit. I hope they will ensure that their electorates, their communities, are educated about the dangers of driving during the Christmas&hyphen;New Year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental point that I hope all members will be passing on to their constituents is that people who are considering driving should not drink, and people should wear their seat belts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Can the minister explain the `win' from the family tax package for the following family in Rockingham, Western Australia: the father is a courier driver earning $25,000 a year, the mother earns $10,000 as a casual shop assistant in a small business and they have two children in community based long day care. This family qualifies to receive only $8.70 per week from the government's tax package con, but the government's cuts to child care mean they will pay an extra $40 per week for child care. Isn't it the case that this family in Rockingham will be more than $30 per week worse off? Why is the government punishing families in such an appalling way?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

That study clearly shows that the initiative will achieve its objectives; in particular, that families with children, especially single income families and especially sole parents, have adequate levels of income and in fact sole parents stand to benefit more than anyone else in the community. Those with children stand to gain $900 a year extra in their income.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proposed that tomorrow we will resume at 10.30 a.m. I do not see any point in us starting at 9.30 a.m., as essentially the task before the House tomorrow is to await the return of matters from the Senate. I expect that the Senate will sit relatively late tonight, so we should have a number of matters which the House can deal with at 10.30 a.m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the other matters before the House, we do have some bills which we have been debating in the last couple of days. I think the migration and bounty bills are still there and the flags bill is proceeding. We also have bills to be returned from the Senate. Members would be aware that there is a range of those.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8415">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proposed that tomorrow we will have the valedictories at 4 o'clock in the usual form.

Lastly, as time permits, we would propose&mdash;we will discuss this during the day with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean)&mdash;a grievance debate and 90-second statements, again, emphasising as time permits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the schedule for the Senate tomorrow, we understand that the Senate could sit as late as midnight tomorrow night or the very early hours of Saturday morning, which means that we will keep the House sitting until the Senate has completed and after the completion or adjournment of the Senate, because there may be a time lag between when matters finish in the Senate and then have to be transmitted to the lower house for completion. I cannot otherwise give members an indication of the likely completion and adjournment of the House but at this stage I do expect that it could easily be 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or even later on Saturday morning.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out these things. The opportunity to vote on Telstra has come up three times in the last month in the Senate and only recently has the government chosen to take advantage of the fact to put it down. The second point is that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) is today moving an unprecedented guillotine of Senate business to ensure that Senate business is completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This contrasts extraordinarily with the way in which we, when in government, were massively disrupted in the Senate by the other side. I also point out that this comes on top of extended evening sittings of the Senate, on top of extended days in the Senate and on top of two extra weeks in the Senate for consideration of government legislation, virtually all of which has arrived&mdash;including their budget legislation&mdash;in the latter stages.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just about every available bit of evidence, numerical or anecdotal, is currently telling exactly the same story about the Australian economy: that it has gone backwards under the coalition, that it is stagnant, that it is underperforming and that it is, `Flat, flat, flat,' as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  was saying a few days ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a matter of the opposition doomsaying or a matter of point scoring; just a matter of stating the simple truth. The evidence is all around us. It is evident in the job figures, it is evident in the growth figures, it is evident in the consumption and retail sales figures and it is evident in about a dozen other indicators presently around. In particular, it is evident in what business leaders are presently saying about this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope Mr Costello, the Treasurer, who&mdash;yes&mdash;is coming into the chamber, will have had the opportunity by now to read the full survey in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> from which he partially quoted today. I think a little bit of that cinemascope smirk, that Panavision smirk, that Imax smirk, will be wiped off his face when he sees what the survey says about what 1,000 CEOs in this country think of the government's handling of the economy and of its economic performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the September quarter, with the triumph of optimism still overexperienced, you had 52 per cent of CEOs saying that the government's performance was good or very good. In the latest quarter survey reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS> this week, you have just 29 per cent of CEOs prepared to give the government and the Treasurer their endorsement for the management of the economy. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS> comments in the accompanying article, this is characterisable as nothing else than `a collapse of support in the business community for this government's economic management'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Treasurer will no doubt say, `How can you say all this in the context of today's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8417"> figures? Don't they tell a different, more optimistic story?' The short answer is they do nothing of the kind. The government has been a little bit inclined, as one would expect, to be triumphalist today about these figures and, on the face of it, improvement in the unemployment rate from 8.8 per cent to 8.5 per cent does give us all something to be reasonably pleased about. Whether it is enough to justify Senator Vanstone, the minister for employment, saying that we are beginning to see the benefits of the government's policy to bring about fundamental changes to the economy to create real jobs, however, is a marker she might well later regret having put down at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is that, if there were signs in all of this that the economy was back on a growth path, that  unemployment was on the way down again and that the human misery associated with it was being reduced, we would all be delighted&mdash;not least those of us in the Labor Party because it is primarily our people, the people whom we support and stand for, who are affected by this. But there are still nearly 800,000 Australians unemployed; there are still 15,000 fewer full-time jobs than there were at the time of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is simply no foundation for optimism in today's figures. Let me say why. It is not a matter of taking the seasonally adjusted figures and attributing great significance to them, because they do jump around. The more appropriate figures to have regard to, as the Treasurer ought to be aware because his own minister for employment and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have acknowledged it, are the trend figures. Senator Vanstone has been saying all year&mdash;she first said it back in April&mdash;that not too much weight should be placed on month to month fluctuations in such a volatile series. The important thing is the underlying trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the trend figures for unemployment and employment you see a much less sanguine, less happy, story from that which the government is inclined to tell about the condition of the economy. Trend unemployment is rising and is at its worst level for two years&mdash;since 1994. The government appears on all the available evidence to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have no chance whatsoever of achieving even its very modest budget forecast of a reduction in unemployment to 8&frac14; per cent by June next year. The Treasurer conceded as much in a speech he made earlier this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, when you look at trend employment you find it crawling along at 0.08 per cent a month. That is equal to annualised employment growth of just one per cent at the moment, just half the government's forecast for employment creation. More generally&mdash;and I hope the Treasurer will acknowledge this&mdash;labour force figures follow current economic activity with a lag. The current economic activity is very flat and there is nothing going on at the moment in the economy that can possibly give anyone any hope of a strong acceleration in employment growth this coming year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we know about current activity in the economy as a whole? What else do the statistics tell us about growth in the economy? Growth in the economy is running now at around two per cent. Last week's national accounts make that perfectly clear when you look at the trend figures and the recent quarters and extrapolate from them. Compare that two per cent with the 3&half; per cent that was forecast in the budget and the four per cent growth that was averaged by the Labor Party in government over the last three years, the five per cent that was achieved by the Labor Party government in the year to March, and also the four to five per cent growth which your current leader, Prime Minister John Howard, last year said had to be achieved and sustained over the rest of the decade and beyond&mdash;four to five per cent&mdash;if we are to `make lasting inroads into unemployment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are not getting four to five per cent; you are not getting 3&half; per cent at the moment. You are getting not much better than just two per cent. The consequences of that for the condition of the economy and, in particular, the plight of the unemployed and those who fear they will be unemployed in the future are immense. The government says, and we will no doubt hear it again from the Treasurer, `It is not the right figure; the right figure is 3.8 per cent. Look at what the national accounts actually said.' But that is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8418"> 3.8 per cent in the year through to the current quarter&mdash;the last quarter reported. Of that 3.8 per cent, 2.9 per cent was achieved as growth under Labor. The last two quarters have generated respectively just 0.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent for a grand total of 0.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer might be heard to say, as I think he was again in question time today, `Well, 0.8 per cent is really pretty good, isn't it? If we can multiply that over the next three quarters of this financial year we won't be doing real bad.' Well, you won't be doing real good because even if you were able to extrapolate in that way, that only gets you to 3.2 per cent which is still less than the miserly 3.5 per cent that you have hung your hat on for the budget. It is not enough to generate any kind of significant reduction in unemployment; it is just not a good enough performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Moreover, there is every reason to believe that that 0.8 per cent will not be sustained. It is based, as you ought to be prepared to acknowledge, on a very high stocks build&hyphen;up in this last quarter. Stock to sale ratios are the highest since December 1993 and, given what we know about private consumption at the moment, that stock build&hyphen;up is not going to be drawn down in any significant way and these figures about growth are not going to be sustained. It is a gloomy picture so far as growth is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly with private consumption, the national accounts figures showed almost no consumption growth over the last quarter. Retail sales figures from the ABS a couple of weeks ago showed them falling for an utterly unprecedented three months in a row. Yesterday you did not know about it in question time when you were sprung with it. You dissimulated, you fudged and fiddled, but the Westpac&hyphen;Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index showed consumer confidence falling a full 6.7 per cent&mdash;back below where it was at budget time and back below consumer confidence when the Labor Party was in office, before you came into government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a devastating indictment of your management, given in particular that private consumption constitutes around 60 per cent of national expenditure. It makes a huge impact <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the economy. What about business investment? Is that going to make any difference? Does that tell a different story? The truth is that business investment has been holding up reasonably well in the aggregate. We acknowledge that. It may meet, alone of all these other figures&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Mr GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly, because when you look at it more closely you see it is being concentrated in those areas of the economy which we all know are not and never will be major employment generators. It is also the case that such investment as is occurring at the moment, as distinct from that which is contemplated, is a function by and large of the degree of confidence that was around at the beginning of the year when the Labor Party was still in office. You are residual beneficiaries of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, because of the worries which presently do exist about private consumption being so weak and about company profitability having declined as much as it has, there is every reason to be concerned as to whether those predicted or expected levels of future investment will hold up. Again, in terms of its impact on the entire economy, it is around only 10 or 11 per cent of the total economic expenditure. Overwhelmingly, the muscle has to come from private consumption and that may well swamp any positive impact that business investment has to contribute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interest rate cut which occurred yesterday was extremely welcomed, and it will do something&mdash;I hope, something significant&mdash;to redress the situation I have been describing. That is why we argued for it; that is why we have very warmly welcomed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the point about it is that interest rate reduction confirms exactly what we have been saying about the economy: it is not a reward for good management of the economy by this government; rather, it is an overdue bail&hyphen;out by the Reserve Bank for an economy which is manifestly in increasing distress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are always two questions that have to be answered in the affirmative if you are going to justify an interest rate cut: does the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8419"> condition of the economy make it desirable; and, is the inflation environment or outlook such as to make it possible? Here, the answer was yes on both counts, because the inflation legacy of the Labor Party government is manifestly holding up&mdash;helped, it has to be said, by the stagnation of the economy at large. But everything else about the economy is flat, making it absolutely desirable&mdash;in fact, unavoidable&mdash;that that particular change should occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone ought to be acutely aware&mdash;it is a simple truth of economic management&mdash;that you cannot rescue the economy, you cannot generate employment growth, by monetary or interest rate policy alone. You have to have a complementary budget and fiscal strategy. We in the Labor Party would say more than that; that you have to have a wages policy, a sensible approach to that part of the tripod of actions and policy responses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has not done that. The government's budget strategy has been totally misconceived in terms of the real problems of this economy at this stage. The slash and burn, fast track deficit reduction that has been adopted basically involves the government in saying, `Hang the consequences of all this for growth, hang the consequences for employment. Leave that to labour market deregulation, leave that to the IR legislation. That will solve that particular problem for us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government now has the IR legislation that it says it wanted, and it will become evident very quickly to the Australian public that any suggestion that it will make any difference to the employment situation is simply illusory. Here, as elsewhere, the electorate has been sold a very large and scraggy pup&mdash;by the `dog' on this particular occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP's budget strategy, the opposition's budget strategy, is very different indeed. We make no bones about stating with confidence what an alternative approach should be. We acknowledge the importance of reducing the deficit, and we want to contribute to a reduction in budget deficit, to improve national savings by that means as well as by actions in the private sector. But we say, and will continue to say, that this is not the highest <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> priority for the Australian economy at the moment. It should not be regarded as a priority which completely outstrips the much greater need at the moment, which is to do something sensible and serious about unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia does not have the kind of deficit or public debt problem that afflicts most other industrialised countries in the world, particularly in Europe. We do not have to take drastic action because of runaway current account or inflation problems. We can afford to take a moderate and balanced approach which does not add to unemployment, which does not involve sacking public servants, taking half a percent off growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony, as we continue to assert, is that you can do all those things by an approach which gets you there but without any of the pain that this government seems determined to perpetrate. There is a high cut road to balance; there is a low cut road to balance. You take the high cut road, we will take the low cut road, and we say that we can get there before you with a much more sane and humane balance being achieved in public expenditure and fiscal achievement as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has squandered a very golden opportunity to deliver strong growth and falling unemployment. It inherited an economy that was really rocketing along at five per cent growth, with 700,000 jobs being created, unemployment coming down from 11 to 8&half; per cent&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was the wrong spokesman, wrong day, wrong analysis. It occurred to me that perhaps the reason the opposition had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) get up today to do the MPI is that it might be his last occasion here as a spokesman on economic matters. I cannot imagine <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8420"> why they would have chosen the day when the labour force figures showed a 24,000 increase in jobs for the month to run an MPI on the stagnating economy. All I can think of is that earlier in the week they sat around and said, `Look, Gareth has had a bad year; we'd better give him the last debate of the year. What will we do it on? We will do it on stagnation.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only trouble is that at 11.30 this morning this `stagnating economy' produced 24,400 jobs. I do not know if they told the shadow Treasurer that and he went ahead in ignorance, or whether they gave him the shortest straw and said, `We've got nothing else to do today; you'd better hop up there and run your line on the stagnating economy.' Perhaps the most prescient explanation is the one I give, and it will be very interesting to see whether the deputy leader is back here next year or whether he is still a spokesman on the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has not been a happy entry into the House of Representatives for him. We understand that it is a different place from the Senate, but it would have been easier for him if his party had allowed him to actually run an economic position. Clearly, the Labor Party has been at sixes and sevens with itself on economic policy. I take that into account as one of the difficulties that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has faced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that the Labor Party started off by saying that there was no deficit. That was the first claim after the election: there was no deficit. Don't you remember? At that point, the deputy leader was sent in here to say that it was all a con, that it had been concocted. That was the first economic proposition that the Labor Party was putting: there was no deficit. If that were right, no deficit reduction strategy was required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Minister for Finance, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), had to maintain that line because he had been assuring everybody during the election that the accounts were balanced. Once the accounts were disclosed and released to us, we knew what he had every wit of knowing during the election campaign, that we were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> facing up to a $8 billion deficit at that stage and a $8 billion deficit the year after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the accounts finally came in, it had worsened. Far from this deficit having been engineered or somehow put into place by the government, the fact was the outcome was a $10 billion deficit. Do you not recall coming into this House after March&mdash;and I think I would ask my advisers, if I were you, for an explanation as to why they put this proposition up&mdash;saying that there was no deficit, it was all a con&mdash;in fact, there was nothing to be balanced? That was the position you were running on behalf of the Labor Party in the aftermath of the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the accounts were disclosed and the Labor Party could not maintain that myth any further, it then said, `We will agree to a deficit reduction strategy and we will agree to balancing the budget.' Your argument at that point, you may recall, was that, again, it would be too much to balance this deficit over two years; what should be done was a balance over three years. That was your argument in the run-up to the August budget; in fact, that was your argument the day after the budget.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And still is&mdash;this is a new development today. What the government did in the budget is put down a three&hyphen;year program. When you were asked the day after the budget on ABC radio on the Couchman program, `What would you have done differently?' you said, `We'd have balanced over three years.' In fact, the night before we had set out a program to balance over three years. Plainly you had not been able to comprehend the budget documents. You were asked, `What would you have done differently?' and you said, `We'd have balanced over three years.' The budget had balanced over three years. It had been announced the day before. It was in the budget paper. That was the position the day after the election: that it would be a different strategy to budget over three years. Oh, what a tangled web we weave! You come in here and say it still is your proposition to balance over three years, but the day after the budget it was a different strategy to the government's to balance over <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8421"> three years. Now, apparently, it is the same strategy. I have often said in relation to these matters: where there is no understanding, there is no conscience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the Labor Party, in its pre- and post-August budget incantation, saying that what it would do differently is that it would balance the budget and it would balance it over three years. Of course, never having an eye for consistency or credibility in relation to policy, what that eventually meant was that it would balance the budget over three years by opposing all expenditure cuts, which meant either one of two things: it really had a tax agenda&mdash;since it is in opposition and did not move any taxes that could not have been its position&mdash;or it had no comprehension that to close a deficit you have to reduce spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people would understand this proposition: if you are spending more than you are earning and you want to get back into a balance, you have to stop spending as much. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has a proposition. He says, `You can have a $10 billion deficit and not cut your spending and somehow it magically disappears.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where do you think all of these things flow from? Where do you think the reductions in interest rates flow from? Has it ever occurred to anybody in the Labor Party to ask this question: in late 1994, official interest rates went up 2&frac34; per cent&mdash;if it were so easy to reduce official interest rates, since you were going to an election in March 1996, why didn't you reduce them? If it were just a matter of doing nothing, why weren't the official interest rates reduced between late 1994 and March 1996? That is when the Labor Party knew it was going to an election. Obviously, home buyers and business would have benefited from interest rate reductions. Why didn't it occur? The reason was the Labor Party couldn't do two things, and these are the two policy responses that have enabled this situation to be set up: one was to lock low inflation and low inflation expectations in&mdash;and that was done by the statement of monetary policy and the position we are taking in relation to wages&mdash;and the second was to address the fiscal problem.</PARA>

But, if the do&hyphen;nothing strategy could have produced all of these things, why didn't it under the Labor government? Why didn't you, in exercise of the do&hyphen;nothing strategy, put any of these measures in place in the lead&hyphen;up to the March 1996 election? The fact is that, until the Labor Party can come to grips with its failures in economic policy and, more importantly, come to grips with the fundamentals of the argument, it will not be taken seriously on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just give an indication of where the Australian economy stands. Growth in the September quarter was 0.8 per cent. Over the year to the September quarter it was 3.8 per cent. They are the outcomes. You talked about various figures. That is the figure. That is the report of the national accounts. The national accounts showed strong growth in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> business investment&mdash;up eight per cent in the September quarter. The capital expenditure survey showed that the fourth set of expectations was 20 per cent higher than the equivalent estimate last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are prospects of pick&hyphen;up in housing, as I said earlier. You have had a 24,000 growth in jobs in the last month. Employment grew by 0.5 per cent in the September quarter, which is consistent with the budget forecast. You have a consumer price index of 2.1 per cent, which is probably better than the budget forecast. You have had three reductions in official interest rates. You now have home mortgage rates as low as they have been right back to June 1974.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer (Mr Costello) and I, as young parents at this time of the year, have the task of examining our young children's school reports. The problem for our children&mdash;and I have two: young Benjamin, who is 13 and in the gallery today, and Clare, who is 11&mdash;is that, unlike the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) yesterday, they do not have the opportunity to write their own school report. It is prepared at arms&hyphen;length, and all we as parents seek when we examine those reports <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> &mdash;and I will have that opportunity on Saturday when, hopefully, I will be able to return home&mdash;is that they have performed to the best of their ability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the real question the Australian community ought to be posing at the moment. Has this government performed to its expectations, to the best of its ability, since it was elected on 2 March? The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said, when responding to the Prime Minister's own report card yesterday entitled `The 1996 progress report to the people', that it was big on rhetoric and little on achievement. If you have any doubts about that, the Australian community ought to objectively examine the performance of the Howard government today with respect to the all&hyphen;important issue of unemployment. I know it is not of concern to the Treasurer, who is leaving the chamber at the moment, because he comes from a well&hyphen;heeled section of the Australian community and he is capable, unlike many Australians, of purchasing his children's way, irrespective of their ability, into a university place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the view that all Australians are entitled to equal opportunities in life. That requires that in examining this government's performance&mdash;its report card&mdash;today we critically examine its performance on the question of jobs. I'll tell you what: it is a pretty miserable performance. The Treasurer suggested today that Australia ought to be relaxed and secure in the knowledge that the trend rate of unemployment is 8.7 per cent. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, said yet again today that she is a friend of the trend&mdash;the 8.7 per cent rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer had the hide to come in here today and say that as we get closer to Christmas Australian families ought to be relaxed and secure in the knowledge that the trend rate of unemployment is 8.7 per cent. Do you know what that trend rate of unemployment 8.7 per cent means? It is not only the same trend rate as last month but also the worst trend rate of unemployment for 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the Prime Minister, unlike the Treasurer, was very cautious in question time today. He knows that his government is on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8424"> the ropes when it comes to achieving their very moderate budget objective of 8.5 per cent unemployment. Compare that to the target we were prepared to set at the start of this term of government. I think our target of five per cent was realisable. The government has set a moderate target of 8.25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When questioned today, the minister for employment was not prepared to commit herself to the capacity of this government to achieve the moderate unemployment rate of 8.25 per cent. I would have expected, with the establishment of that all&hyphen;important unemployment committee, that the Howard government coming up to Christmas could have come up with a few new ideas about how to assist industry, to build confidence in the Australian community and to ensure that we can do something about making substantial progress to reduce unemployment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I'll tell you what: what is the view of the Australian community about this government's report card and the performance of the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and their other millionaire ministerial mates who sit on the front bench? I note that in question time today the Treasurer referred to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>. He selectively quoted reports from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> about the performance of the government and the business community's view about the report card of the Howard government to date. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 16 December states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They feel the Government does not understand the needs of big business and that it lacks vision.</PARA>
<PARA>The article by David Forman goes on to state that almost every sector has a low opinion of Canberra's sympathy for business. And well might the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) hang his head in shame. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>  says that we depend on confidence in business to invest, to create jobs that support regional Australia&mdash;that sector of Australia that this government walks away from&mdash;and to create economic well-being. What does the business community say about them? They say that almost every sector has a low opinion of Canberra's sympathy for business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gets worse. Let us examine some of the fine print in the article that the Treasurer chose to ignore today. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite expectations of a much better year, business support for the way the Government is doing its job has collapsed.</PARA>
<PARA>And well might it collapse. There is no support for regional Australia and no support for industry. Today the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) wanted to talk about young unemployed Australians. He did not tell the House today that there are 11,200 more young unemployed Australians now than when the Howard government assumed responsibility for the future of this nation in March of this year.</PARA><!-- <ERROR>Class: 1

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to a number of debates in this chamber. I listened to a number of people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8426"> who are currently occupying the opposition benches when they were in government. I have heard some pretty outrageous statements and a lot of hypocrisy in this chamber, but rarely have I heard anything like the hypocrisy I heard in this chamber today. The remnants of the former government, who are occupying those benches opposite me, have the gall to start a negative campaign. The topic of this MPI today is yet another example of the negative campaign that the opposition has been waging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it should be remembered that this is an opposition who, when they were occupying the government benches, were responsible for the worst recession in 60 years. They were responsible for driving thousands of small businesses to the wall. That resulted in thousands of people losing their family businesses and their family farms, and it inevitably led to the break&hyphen;up of many families. This is a group who, throughout their 13 years of government, were intent on deal making with interest groups at the expense of many of our major industries&mdash;certainly at the expense of our small business sector, the sector that is going to increase job opportunities in our economy. They were the group who were responsible for a 300 per cent increase in Commonwealth debt and an 800 per cent increase in foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Australian people said on 2 March, `We have had enough of the deceit, the false promises, the broken promises and the lost opportunities,' we discovered on entering government perhaps one of the biggest porkies of all times perpetrated by those opposite. They kept insisting that the accounts were balanced. Instead it was brought home to us that there was a massive $10.3 billion deficit, the end product of six consecutive underlying budget deficits. For the last five years of the Labor government, budget deficits totalled $70 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) mention a school report card. I think it is about time that this House and those listening to this broadcast were reminded of the report card of that crowd over there who occupied the government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benches for 13 years. Their report card was certainly nothing to be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at interest rates under Labor, we see that we had the second highest prime rate amongst developed nations. Credit card interest rates went up to 25 per cent. Housing interest rates rose above 17 per cent. In fact, many small businesses were paying interest rates of around 23 per cent. Proof of that item on that report card can be seen, if you drive through many country towns like the ones in my electorate, in the number of vacant shops and the number of families who have lost their businesses&mdash;testimony to the very bad economic management of the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Living standards is another item on their report card. Our world ranking, based on per capita income, fell from tenth to 22nd in the 10 years from 1983 to 1993. National savings were lower than at the depth of the 1982-83 recession. Household savings were at a record low level. Is it any wonder that they were at such a low level when, over the past decade, it has taken two family incomes just to meet mortgage payments and household expenditures and keep families together? It has been so tough for many families in my electorate that they have not even been able to afford to send their children on school camps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the 1982-83 recession, investment fell to 22.6 per cent of GDP. It recovered slightly to 25.7 per cent and then plummeted to 20.5 per cent in Keating's recession of 1993. At the end of the Keating era, it had only risen to 21.7 per cent of GDP. As is the case with unemployment, the damage done was greater and the recovery has been so much weaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Investment was at a lower level in March 1996 when we came into government than it was at the worst point in the recession of 1982-83. Those figures, while they are evidence of the failure of the previous Labor government, do not show the pain, the suffering, the pressure, the tension and stress felt by so many Australian families. Our current account was the worst in the OECD. For 13 years Labor fiddled around with the tax system, and every time they fiddled with that tax system they created an even greater <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8427"> compliance nightmare. Productivity levels under the previous Labor government were 10 per cent below the OECD average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard some talk today from those in the opposition about jobs. In the six years from July 1990, the beginning of Labor's recession, to March of this year, only 7,100 full-time jobs were created. Between July 1990 and November 1992, 433,000 full-time jobs had been destroyed. Once again, those figures do not show the pain and the suffering that those families and those who have lost their jobs have gone through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the report card that the member for Batman did not want to talk about and did not want to share with those listening to this broadcast. At the end of the 13 years of Labor government, that was a disgraceful report card. The comments at the bottom of Labor's report card&mdash;the member for Batman might look at comments on the bottom of his children's report card&mdash;showed that Labor had slashed real wages and productivity growth, that it had caused the worst unemployment since the Great Depression and that it had sent us spiralling into massive deficit, choking every single Australian with debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been the legacy of 13 years of Labor rule. Is it any wonder that on 2 March of this year Australians in resounding numbers said that they have had enough? Yet the opposition have the audacity to bring this MPI on today. I believe the reason why the opposition are constantly being negative and constantly wanting to indulge in mythology is that they are still trying to hide their disastrous record. They are still trying to talk down the economy. They are still trying not to accept all the improvements and all the advances that have been made in our economy under the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we have achieved so much in just the eight months since coming to office. I would remind the House and the few opposition members present in the chamber that their report card has already been judged at the 2 March election. Just in case they did not get the message, at the Lindsay by-election the Australian people again made the message perfectly and abundantly clear. In effect, what <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they said was, `We will judge the Labor government by its failures.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.37 p.m.)&mdash;I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill implements the government's election commitment to provide rollover relief for the disposal of active assets used by small businesses. Rollover relief has been eagerly awaited by thousands of small business operators that potentially faced a capital gains tax bill when they sold an asset and sought to invest the capital in a new one. The capital gains tax acted as an impediment to small business growth and jobs in the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill demonstrates this government's strong commitment to small business. This measure provides small business with a boost of $200 million per year. The removal of the `like kind' business test and the extension of time for the acquisition of replacement assets further demonstrates our commitment to listening to the concerns of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taxpayers eligible for the rollover relief are individuals, partners, companies and trusts. The measures will apply to disposals of assets on or after 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also implements the government's election commitment to inject $15 million per year to provide more generous tax treatment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8428"> for employee share schemes in recognition of the role of employee share schemes in strengthening employee participation in Australian business. The bill will double the income tax exemption from $500 to $1,000 per employee per year, with a matching increase in the deduction available to employers. This bonus to employees will be available for shares or rights acquired on or after 1 July 1996. The bill also eases the employee participation condition for employee share schemes to qualify for concessional tax treatment from 75 per cent to two&hyphen;thirds of employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments to the employee share scheme provisions announced in the budget are also being made, together with a number of technical amendments raised in submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also implements the election commitment to bring an end to the concessional 20 per cent prime cost depreciation rate for trading ships. Transitional arrangements will enable ships that already qualify for the concession to remain eligible, as well as ships in respect of which a purchase or construction contract was signed before 1 May 1996 provided the ship is delivered to the shipowner and registered in Australia before 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to section 160ZZS of the Income Tax Assessment Act announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget are also contained in the bill. The bill will amend section 160ZZS to require public entities&mdash;that is, public companies, publicly traded unit trusts and mutual insurance organisations&mdash;to test for changes in the majority underlying interests in the assets of the public entity every five years from 20 January 1997 or where there is abnormal trading. To assist public entities to undertake these tests, streamlined rules for determining majority underlying interests will be able to be used by public entities.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxpayers other than public entities will not be affected by the amendment of section 160ZZS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pay&hyphen;as&hyphen;you&hyphen;earn provisions, and certain rebate and exemption provisions of the income tax law, will be amended to replace the current references to Commonwealth education or training programs with a generic term&mdash;Commonwealth education or training payments. The use of the general expression <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the tax law to describe the Commonwealth education or training scheme payments administered by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and some other Commonwealth agencies will ensure the taxation result intended to apply to such payments is consistently achieved even when changes are made to those schemes or schemes are deleted or added.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will amend Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 4) 1995 to allow companies the option to defer conversion to the class C franking account after they are paid a class C franked dividend or a trust or partnership amount with class C franking credits attached. The bill will also amend that act to eliminate an unintended dual liability to class A franking deficit tax or franking additional tax which may arise in certain situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Technical amendments will also be made to the foreign source income regime, commercial debt forgiveness provisions, tax file number provisions and provisions relating to equity investments in small and medium enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House and provide an explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill includes a range of measures announced in the budget to amend the provisions of the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 relating to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8429">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget announced the government's intention to achieve savings in the scheme by tightening eligibility and containing growth in outlays which have resulted from decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal&mdash;the AAT&mdash;and the Federal Court which have had the effect of widening eligibility under the scheme beyond its intent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its recent performance audit on the diesel fuel rebate scheme, the Australian National Audit Office recommended that the purpose and objective of the scheme be clarified and that a range of measures be introduced to improve administration and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The genesis of this scheme lies in providing relief from excise on diesel fuel used `off road'. This link, which hypothecated excise for road funding, was terminated in 1959. The rebate scheme introduced in 1982 was more restrictive than the previous exemption scheme. Subsequent amendments mean that it is now highly focused on activities which contribute directly to the competitiveness of the mining and primary production sectors. It is no longer appropriate to consider the scheme in its historic context. Excise and customs duties raised on diesel fuel are general taxation measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The diesel fuel rebate scheme provides rebate of duty on diesel fuel for certain activities, mainly in the mining and agricultural industries. Its primary purpose is to maintain competitiveness in these key export industries, in a manner consistent with the government's broader fiscal objectives. The scheme also has a very limited number of community and social welfare objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal changes to the scheme proposed by the bill involve:</PARA>
<PARA>1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> amendments to address the effects of recent AAT and Federal Court decisions which have had the effect of widening eligibility;</PARA>
<PARA>2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> removal from eligibility of certain activities under the mining operations category;</PARA>
<PARA>3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a range of measures to improve accountability requirements, clamp down on misuse and improve administration of the scheme;</PARA>
<PARA>4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the repeal of the current provision relating to notices of intention; and</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> an amendment to enable rebate to be refused or recovered where diesel fuel is not used in eligible activities due to loss in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proposed that the changes in items 1, 2 and 5 take effect from a date to be proclaimed which will be shortly after royal assent to the bill. The changes to items 3 and 4 require publicity, client education and technology changes and will therefore be proclaimed to take effect six months later.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Effects of recent AAT and Federal Court decisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been several decisions in recent times which have had the effect of expanding eligibility under the scheme beyond what the government believes was intended, with consequent effects on outlays. In some areas, the potential financial impact of decisions is very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular amendments will ensure the continuation of rebate for diesel fuel used in carrying out mining activities but will preclude from eligibility certain activities, best described as undertaken for economic&hyphen;marketing reasons, rather than the physical extraction of minerals, and activities which essentially involve the transport of inputs&hyphen;materials for mining or beneficiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's clear intention is that rebate paid under the legislation should be confined to the narrow definition of eligible activities in the legislation&mdash;that is, the intention is not that the legislation be defined broadly and beneficially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments proposed in this bill are designed to tighten and narrow eligibility. It is the government's intention to continue to adopt such an approach in the face of any future broadening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most significant decision which has potential for expansion in eligibility related to an appeal by Dampier Salt (Operations) Pty Ltd against a decision of the AAT in relation to the point at which payment of rebate on the recovery of salt ceases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Full Federal Court's judgment is considered to be the most far reaching ever delivered in relation to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. It represents a fundamental shift from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8430"> a scheme based on the concept of an activity, in this case mining, being regarded as a physical act, that is the extraction of a product from the ground, to a concept of the activity being an economic one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Federal Court found that even though Dampier Salt's product could be sold in the condition it was in at the first stockpile, it was uneconomic for the company to do so. It was only economic to sell into the market it actually supplied. The court determined the second stockpile activities were so closely related to the process of extraction of salt from the brine in which it was embedded, that they fell within the concept of mining operations.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has never intended to pay rebate to these types of operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the definitions, particularly beneficiation, make it clear that the physical act of mining or beneficiation is eligible for rebate. It ensures that payment of rebate does not extend to activities involved in getting the product to the marketplace, such as the broad economic factors which were the basis of the full Federal Court judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several other recent decisions addressed what might essentially be categorised as transport activities. The only transport activities intended to be covered are the transport of minerals and ores for beneficiation at facilities remote from the place at which mining activity is carried out, and certain activities specifically provided for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments were made to the act in 1995 and 1996 to ensure that activities `connected with' mining were no longer eligible for rebate. The interpretation of the so&hyphen;called `sweeper clauses' had been a source of contention over the years and generated most of the litigation under the scheme. These clauses were replaced with an objective list of activities that are eligible for rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the decision of Dyno&hyphen;Westfarmers the AAT found that driving explosive trucks over an average distance of 150 kilometres each way between the explosives depot and the mine sites was either `mining for minerals' or `the preparation of a site to enable mining for minerals to commence', as those long journeys were `an integral part of this activity'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government considers that it is wrong to apply the concept that an activity is eligible for rebate because it is integral to another eligible activity. It is the intent of the diesel fuel rebate scheme to pay rebate only on those activities that are explicitly mentioned in the legislation and not to activities that are said to be integral to, associated with or connected with these activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments are necessary to put the intent of the scheme beyond doubt. The approach adopted by the AAT in the Dyno&hyphen;Westfarmers case would defeat the purpose of the amendments made in 1995 which removed the `connected with' sweeper clauses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly the AAT and Federal Court have considered the question of transport of materials&hyphen;inputs to mining operations and beneficiation in recent times. Rebate is intended to be paid for beneficiation of minerals and ores, including transport where such beneficiation occurs at a place removed from the actual place of mining operations. Rebate is not intended to be paid for the transport of goods&hyphen;materials&hyphen;inputs for mining operations or beneficiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome of consideration of these issues has varied and this creates uncertainty as to the overall intent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Westrail matter, the Federal Court found that transporting coal to a place of beneficiation by rail was part of beneficiation itself, because the transport was `integral' to having the bauxite beneficiated. This logic was comprehensively reviewed and rejected by the AAT in the Queensland Rail matter. The two decisions cannot stand together. This bill therefore amends the diesel fuel rebate scheme to ensure that only the transport of the minerals and ores to be actually beneficiated receives rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another recent decision in the matter of Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Company Pty Ltd, the AAT found that processes resulting in the production of ferromanganese and silicomanganese by smelting operations constituted the beneficiation of a mineral and were therefore eligible for rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to the definition of `minerals' will restore the original intent of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8431"> the scheme that a mining operation must be in relation to a natural mineral. The amendment will also sharpen the focus on the beneficiation activities that are intended to be rebatable.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Removal of certain activities from eligibility in the mining category.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government announced in the budget that the diesel fuel rebate scheme would be revamped to curb overclaiming and contain growth. To achieve its objectives in containing growth in the mining category, it entered into consultation with representatives of the mining sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining sector recognising the government's fiscal requirements accepted the need to tighten eligibility by identifying areas to be excluded from eligibility to ensure that the benefits are contained to mining activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes put forward by the mining sector have been accepted by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government accepts that these changes contribute to achieving the savings identified at the time of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government accepts that growth in rebate payments for eligible activities under the revised arrangements will occur. Once growth levels are established and forward estimates of expenditure are set it may be necessary as part of the budget planning process to put in place measures to ensure the overall budgetary strategy is achieved. Consideration is being given to appropriate means of ensuring that the expenditure levels once set will not be exceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government and industry will work together to assess net growth which will be used in setting budget outlays and forward estimates. This will involve annual discussions which will also involve a review of the effectiveness and efficiency of the scheme in meeting its objectives and intent.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Measures to improve accountability and administration</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>A range of amendments are proposed which will improve accountability requirements, assist in enabling a clamp down on misuse of the scheme and improve its administration. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> These changes apply to all claimants under the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian National Audit Office performance report highlighted a number of areas where improvements would significantly reduce administrative costs and lead to more effective management of the scheme. These include:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> adopting risk management principles and practices;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> adopting best practices observed in other programs; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> making more effective use of information technology.</PARA>
<PARA>Statistical analysis and monitoring of overall trends indicate that overpayments, that is payment of rebate to which claimants are not entitled, are made under the scheme. Additionally the analysis shows that there is a significant level of overclaiming, that is claims above the level of entitlement, which are made but detected prior to payment and do not result in outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To a significant extent, these arise from the prospective nature of the scheme and a lack of legislative support for the self&hyphen;assessment nature of the scheme, including ineffective penalty provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arrangements to modernise the administration of the scheme have been under way for some time. These focus on legislative reform to underpin self&hyphen;assessment, to place the onus on claimants to make and retain documentation which will substantiate their applications for rebate with effective risk assessment measures in place to assess compliance. This will be backed by effective penalty arrangements which rely on strict liability requirements for claimants to maintain records to substantiate claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure that risk assessment measures are well grounded and effective claimants will be required to provide from time to time information on the nature of their operations relevant to their use of diesel fuel. While the government recognises these requirements impose obligations on claimants to provide more extensive information than that presently required, this is not considered too great a burden for a scheme which outlays around <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8432"> $1.4 billion of taxpayers' funds. It will serve to ensure that those entitled to rebate receive their full benefits and the scheme is not diluted by misuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly for a self&hyphen;assessment scheme will be the ability of claimants to obtain advice from Customs on the eligibility of their activities and insure themselves against being penalised, on the basis that information contained in the request accurately describes the claimant's circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments in particular formalise a post transaction audit regime, make provision for voluntary repayment of overclaimed rebate without penalty and for adjustment to be made to claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments do not remove the ability for criminal prosecution where fraud or serious instances of overclaiming, which seek to misuse the benefits of the scheme, are involved. Recent successful prosecutions have resulted in significant custodial sentences.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Repeal of notices of intention</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under amendments made in 1993, a provision was inserted to restrict payment of rebate to fuel purchased within three years before the application was received. To ensure that claimants were not disadvantaged, this provision allowed for claimants to give notice prior to 1 July 1994 of an intention to make an application in relation to purchases back to 1986. The effect of that notice was to preserve a claimant's entitlement and not have it constrained by the three&hyphen;year provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In excess of 2,000 notices were lodged under this provision and, to date, the bulk of these have not been translated into claims under the scheme. These notices of intention represent a potentially significant outstanding contingent liability on the Commonwealth. The bill therefore proposes to sunset this provision. Those who lodged notices of intention have had over two years to lodge claims, and it is intended by the bill to only allow another six months for this to occur. All those who lodged notices will be contacted, in writing, advised of the impending change and given the opportunity to lodge a claim before the expiration of the provision.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Refusal or recovery where diesel fuel not used in eligible activities</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is uncertainty as to whether rebate can be refused, or, if paid, recovered where diesel fuel is purchased for an eligible purpose but is lost and consequently not used in eligible activities. The bill provides that rebate is not payable or can be recovered where diesel fuel is lost, whether because of accident, theft or any other reason, and is not used in eligible activities. I commend the bill and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am pleased to present the report of the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jet fresh: paddock to plate</EMPHASIS> . This reference was first referred to this committee in the previous parliament and re&hyphen;referred by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to the committee in the 38th Parliament. The committee received over 100 submissions and 38 exhibits. It conducted five public hearings in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra. Evidence was received from 59 witnesses <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8433"> representing 31 organisations. The report contains 16 recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jet fresh: paddock to plate</EMPHASIS>, the key messages are the need to export products valued by the foreign market, target markets, target high value products and get the quality right to meet the needs of overseas customers. For Australia to succeed further as an exporter of perishable and time sensitive products, a cultural change is needed throughout the export chain and the incentive for change must be commercially based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to cargo terminal operations, during the inquiry the committee inspected the cargo terminals at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. Evidence suggested that competition should be encouraged in the cargo terminal operations sector to provide choice to airlines and forwarders, to encourage improvements in service and because competition has the potential to lower prices. The committee has recommended that the government and Federal Airports Corporation facilitate effective competition in the CTO sector and that the FAC should allow off&hyphen;airport CTOs as long as Customs and AQIS standards are met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee received evidence on the need for better marketing skills. Mr Peter Pokorny, National Merchandise Manager Produce with Woolworths, said that Australian exporters needed to visit foreign markets, target suitable sectors in the foreign market and produce appropriate products. Other evidence highlighted the need to supply the direct amount of product, design appropriate packaging and be able to negotiate successfully with foreign buyers. The committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Federal Government initiate action to improve the export business and marketing skills of producers who produce, or are capable of producing, high value perishable and time sensitive products in accordance with export market requirements. Particular attention should be given to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> improving skills related to market research, promotion and negotiation; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> facilitating strategic alliances and partnerships.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Federal Government, in consultation with business, initiate action to facilitate industry support <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for research and development projects to develop appropriate packaging of exports of perishable products, including packaging which:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> maintains product quality throughout the handling process;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is supermarket&hyphen;ready; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> extends the shelf life of the product.</PARA>
<PARA>The success of the Western Australian Air Freight Export Council in improving export performance shows the value of an industry&hyphen;driven and export&hyphen;focused group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has recommended that the government assess the feasibility of establishing groups based on the APEC model and that the government provide seed funding, if such groups are feasible, conditional on dollar for dollar contributions from state governments and/or industry, and subject to review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of freight capacity, the committee found Australian air freight rates for exports are some of the lowest in the world. They are sustained by passenger services and inbound freight rates. This has allowed low value products to continue to be exported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amount of capacity available to exporters will be determined by the demand for passenger services and inbound freight. Exporters wishing to use dedicated freight services may have to pay a premium. There are some problems on a few routes&mdash;such as Japan, Hong Kong and Thailand&mdash;where air freight capacity is tight and, in particular, when peak harvest and holiday periods coincide in November and December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Impediments to the export of perishable and time sensitive products do not lie primarily with the transport sector. Forwarders can obtain capacity from the airlines for exporters who are able to coordinate regular loads over extended periods or who can anticipate capacity needs well in advance. Vanessa Fanning, Group Manager Public Policy, TNT, told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the demand is there and we have a quality product to satisfy it, then the transport solutions will be found.</PARA>
<PARA>Quality assurance handling agreements are a significant milestone in creating a successful export culture because the correct handling of products is important to export success. The Australian Seafood Industry Council is devel <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8434"> oping assurance handling agreements. These agreements specify the requirements for appropriate handling as products move through the export chain. The committee has recommended that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy widely disseminate information concerning quality assurance handling agreements and that the government facilitate the further development of such agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision of additional infrastructure at airports, such as air-side cold stores, needs to be determined on a commercial basis. Exporters need to be willing to pay for this high level of service. The committee received proposals to create international air freight hubs, for example at Avalon, Balranald, Dubbo, Griffith, Narrandera-Leeton, Parkes and Wentworth. Decisions on substantial infrastructure projects such as building or upgrading airports need to be made on sound commercial bases. On the limited evidence provided to the committee, proposals for inland international air freight hubs are unlikely to be commercially viable. The committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Federal Government should make no decision to fund the construction of inland international air freight hubs without extensive further assessment into such proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee's recommendations contain important initiatives to improve the export of perishable and time sensitive products. The committee's final recommendation asks that the government, through the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, report to the parliament on the progress of these initiatives by 31 October 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, the conduct of the inquiry would not have been possible without the help of the air freight exporting community and my colleagues on the committee in the 38th Parliament. Of course, I acknowledge the members of the committee in the 37th Parliament. I thank them for their contribution. I note in particular the work done by the Hon.

Air freight is the most expensive form of freight in the world. It is not something that can be developed on the basis that you can get a back&hyphen;haul rate from imports, enjoy a cross&hyphen;subsidy from imports across to exports, and then expect the capacity that is available to you to develop and expand based on the back&hyphen;haul rate. When additional capacity has to be utilised, has to be brought in, it has to earn its keep. It has to bear the full cost of the placement on that route and in both directions. That is the message that really has not been understood by many people aspiring to the export market and to the use of air freight services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph 2.11 of the report makes the point that if producers of perishable products want to export successfully then they need to produce high value goods, and they need to produce goods that are delivered on time and that are of consistent quality. That message has to be developed. The market in which we are competing is a market in which there are many players, and many established players. We have Israel developing crops in Australia for export out of Australia. We have New Zealand, to our east, which has done much better than Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the unexpected points that came out of the inquiry was that New Zealand is utilising Australian air freight capacity. New <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8435"> Zealand has developed a high quality product, a stronger market, better product identification, reliable delivery and consistent quality. For those who are interested, if they look to paragraph 3.55, table 2.1, of the report they will see that New Zealand can get a better rate out of Australia than they can from New Zealand. For instance, the rate to Hong Kong is $A2.78 per kilo ex&hyphen;New Zealand. But ex&hyphen;New Zealand via Sydney to Hong Kong is only $A2.06. Similarly, the rate to Tokyo is 16c per kilo cheaper exporting from New Zealand via Australia than it is exporting directly from New Zealand into Tokyo. It is the same with Singapore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New Zealanders are always hungrier, go harder and develop these more prestige quality markets and are utilising our freight capacity and getting a better and cheaper rate for it. That was a surprise to the chairman, to me and to all of us associated with the inquiry. As we work through that, we need to get the message across to those in the potential producer side of the industry that they need to go out and develop their market, develop a quality product and develop product identification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, in respect of market intelligence&mdash;that is covered adequately in the report&mdash;producers need to identify the section of the market they want to be in and they need to produce a product that the market wants. This was a point made by Peter Pokorny, National Merchandise Manager Produce with Woolworths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Producers need to go out and talk to their potential customers, identify the product they want, the quality they want, when they want it, what volumes they want and then go for it rather than saying, as we have in the past when there has been a bit of surplus production in Australia, `We'll see what we can do in respect of export.' New Zealand is the model. There are people in the industry who are very skilled at exploiting and developing that export market utilising air freight services. We need to follow through on what they are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Coming back to the costs that the chairman referred to, because there is a substantial and effective cross&hyphen;subsidy from imports to ex ports utilising air freight, we need to recognise that the scale of capacity available and the frequency of capacity available is a function of existing passenger services and a few dedicated freight services. Where the passenger services are is where the capacity is. The capacity can be drawn to where it is needed if the exporters develop that premium product with proper identification, a product that is able to bear the additional rate that is needed to justify the provision of air freight service in and out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that kept coming up all the time was that it was a case of exaggerated expectations, that it was always the transport costs that were the barrier rather than the exporter having sought out a market or selling a product that was able to bear the cost of the freight involved. The conclusion in 4.130 of the committee's report adequately deals with it, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the impediments to the export of perishable and time sensitive products do not lie primarily with the transport sector. While . . . some participants in the freight chain may be seeking to blame other participants for poor service, the committee considers it is more important to address the underlying reasons and to move forward&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I believe there is considerable potential there to be exploited but the exporters have to go out, pick and identify their market, and go for that premium price and get it. As Vanessa Fanning from TNT said, `If you have got the product and you are able to pay for the service, the service will be made available.' I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I, too, commend Meg Crooks, John Carter and other members of the secretariat for their work on the production of this report by the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform. I also commend the chairman of the committee, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) for his work in producing what is, as has been noted, a unanimous report to the House. I echo the words of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) that one of the things that emerges from this report is that, although there are some problems in the transport chain with respect to air freight of perishable produce from Australia, by and large the prob <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8436"> lems that Australian producers do have in this area do not relate to the transport sector. One of the things the report does is expose, as the honourable member indicated, exaggerated expectations in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no one big problem in this area; there are significant small problems or medium&hyphen;sized problems in various parts of the chain but there is no one big bang sort of problem that can be addressed. There are structural issues that are hard to get around, for example the fact that Australia is not in a hub position as a transport operator but is largely at the end of the line. There are some significant and important suggestions and recommendations in the report such as the proposals for more competition in the container terminal operator area and more assistance to exporters to develop greater skills in marketing and promotion for their products&mdash;particularly a greater export focus, which I think is clearly the major difference between New Zealand and Australia and is the area where we have to improve. Another important recommendation is to establish industry freight export groups, giving the capacity for a market driven and industry driven strategy which should improve our performance in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to comment finally on the question of the feasibility of an inland freight airport, be it at Parkes, Narrandera, Wentworth or any one of a number of locations that have been suggested. As the chairman of the committee indicated, the recommendation from the committee is that the government should not make a decision to establish and fund such an airport without extensive further investigation of that proposition. The committee was of the view that such an airport would be unlikely to be viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great problem is that we cannot put the cart before the horse. The demand for freight services, in my view, is not at this stage sufficient for the establishment of such an airport and the expenditure of large sums of taxpayers' money to establish such an airport. The critical mass is not there at the moment. It could well be in the future; one would hope that that will be the case but certainly at the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> moment it would be unlikely to be economically viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to emphasise, however, that we had only relatively limited evidence before us. We were not the feasibility study into these proposals and should not be considered as such. The finding of the committee on this issue should only really be considered as an indicative or interim finding. It is up to the government to give further consideration to this proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated, my view&mdash;as was the unanimous view of the committee members&mdash;is that at this point it is unlikely to be viable. But it is something that Australia and the government should continue to keep in mind for the future as something that may become viable at some point. It is something that certainly requires further examination. I thank again the members of the secretariat and the chairman for their great contributions. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I take pleasure in tabling the review of Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 6 1995-96 on the community development employment projects scheme, the CDEP scheme. This is the first report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs for the 38th Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8437">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Audit Report No. 6 is phase one of a two&hyphen;part performance audit of the CDEP scheme by the Auditor-General. Phase one addresses the administration of the scheme by the Cairns regional office and the Queensland state office. It also considered the role of the central office in Canberra. Phase two, which is due to be tabled in February 1997, will provide an overview of the administration of the CDEP scheme throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will take the opportunity of commenting on two issues&mdash;the CDEP scheme itself and performance audits by the audit office. The community development employment projects scheme is of enormous benefit to many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout this country. It provides a form of employment where there are few or no alternative employment opportunities, and it delivers services to the communities themselves. Total participant numbers as at 30 June 1995 were 27,041, of whom 19,256 were in remote localities and 7,785 in rural and urban communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme has undergone significant change since its inception 20 years ago, particularly in regard to the enormous growth which it has<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">experienced in the last 10 years. This growth places many pressures on the administration of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian National Audit Office has an important role to play in the examination of government activity. When parliamentary committees review audit reports, they add value to the work of the audit office by following up the response to the audit reports. Committees can also play a valuable role in scrutinising the activities of the audit office to ensure that the audit process has been undertaken to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has a general duty to review audit reports, but there is great merit in the subject specific committees taking up this work where appropriate. I commend the practice to other committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the CDEP scheme, the Auditor-General has made an important contribution by helping the scheme meet the changing demands of government reporting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> requirements and the needs of the scheme's participants. The committee welcomes this first report of the two&hyphen;phase audit process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ANAO made 16 recommendations which address the performance of ATSIC in relation to the CDEP scheme at the central, state and regional office levels. The committee believes that these are important audits which make a real difference to the administration of the scheme and, more importantly, to the almost 30,000 indigenous participants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objective of the committee was to examine and review the findings of Audit Report No. 6 and to follow up the implementation of the recommendations made in that report, rather than to review the CDEP scheme in its entirety. It must be acknowledged at the outset that ATSIC has done considerable work to implement the recommendations made by the Australian National Audit Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, successive reviews of the CDEP scheme have identified common problems. The ANAO commented that many of these problems still exist and made several recommendations in response to these concerns. Information collection and analysis are an important part of the evaluation of any program. However, while the collection of data does not appear to be a problem, the analysis of this information and the feedback to indigenous communities need further work by the ATSIC administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to training, ATSIC has also put in place measures which the ANAO said represented good practice. The committee commented that ATSIC needs to ensure that it builds on the work that has been done. The commission should undertake an evaluation of the effectiveness of training initiatives and programs to ensure they are reaching the target audience. The committee also believes that ATSIC's central office should take a more proactive approach to the distribution of information to state and regional offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CDEP scheme has been operating for almost 20 years. In this time it is apparent that there have been many successful projects which have been of enormous benefit to indigenous communities, whether they are of an economic, social or cultural nature. It <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8438"> would be useful if there had been some analysis of the benefits of the scheme to indigenous communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addressing this issue, the committee has recommended that ATSIC undertake an analysis of the benefits of the scheme to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who participate. The analysis should consider the linkages between the objectives set by communities, the strategies to implement these objectives and the outcomes. The committee believes that this will be beneficial to the further development of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to state that the committee's report must, to some extent, be tentative because it is anticipated that phase two of the audit may encompass some of the matters raised in Audit Report No. 6. For this reason the committee has deferred final conclusions on some issues raised in the phase one report. When the phase two report is completed, the committee will have the opportunity to review the audit in its entirety. I look forward to examining further the implementation of the recommendations made by the audit office in that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, I would like to thank Judy Middlebrook, Craig Dukes, Claressa Surtees, Penne Humphries, and members of the committee for their hard work in supporting this inquiry. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

In particular, I support his comments on the importance of the community development employment projects scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme has many benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, not only in remote areas but also in rural and urban centres. It is a scheme that affects the lives of over 27,000 indigenous people every day. It is a major source of income for many indigenous communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CDEP scheme represents approximately 31 per cent of ATSIC's budget. For 1995-96, 63 per cent of the funds for CDEP could be offset against some form of Department of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Social Security expenditure. This is a significant proportion of the total CDEP budget which normally would be administered by the DSS through various payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end result is many benefits for indigenous people. Some of these include assistance in the transition to more permanent work and access to more flexible training programs. It has also been shown to improve community self-esteem and self-confidence, and to assist in empowering indigenous people by providing a sense of community ownership and control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to congratulate ATSIC on the work it has done, at all levels of the administration, to implement the recommendations made by the Australian National Audit Office. This has led to significant improvements in the delivery of this program to indigenous people and communities. It is a worthwhile program which can only be improved by the audit process and the implementation of the recommendations made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations made by the ANAO reflect the significant changes that the CDEP scheme has undergone in recent years. It is up to ATSIC to ensure that it builds on the good work that has been done, ultimately leading to improvements for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All efforts should be made to retain the integrity of this important scheme. The Auditor-General has an important role in ensuring that this occurs. The Australian National Audit Office is in a position to identify problems and recommend how they can be solved. It is also able to identify areas of good practice in the administration of the scheme and bring these to the attention of the ATSIC administration with a view to their wider application across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that it is reasonable to expect a high level of accountability for the expenditure of public funds to apply to the ATSIC administration. However, it must be remembered that the majority of the funding involved in the CDEP scheme is spent at the community level and is paid to participants in lieu of unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8439">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be unreasonable and discriminatory to expect community participants to demonstrate the same level of administrative expertise in providing details relating to the expenditure of CDEP funds as one would expect of public servants. The system of accountability should not place unfair burdens on the participants in the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to the committee's examination of the phase two audit report and to assessing the progress that has been made in the implementation of the ANAO's recommendations more widely throughout the country. In closing, I would like to thank the committee secretariat for their hard work, particularly under the changed and at many times difficult circumstances of the new committee office.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this adjournment debate, I want to pay tribute to a voluntary organisation that performs an excellent service in the electorate of Greenway&mdash;that is, the Blacktown State Emergency Service. The State Emergency Service is a state&hyphen;wide emergency and rescue service dedicated to assisting the community. It is almost entirely supported by volunteers with over 200 units located throughout New South Wales and comprising more than 10,000 volunteer members who are easily identified by their distinctive orange overalls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Australian communities live with a variety of hazards, both natural and man-made. The hazards include those arising from technology, human fault and hostile action. Some major natural disasters, such as cyclones and bushfires, are seasonal and regional, but other types of hazards, particularly those made by man, are less predictable and could occur anywhere. As far as natural hazards are con cerned, I refer members to the giant hailstone storms that were experienced in the Hunter Valley yesterday. This would be the type of natural disaster that the local State Emergency Service would respond to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Australia cannot be regarded as disaster prone in world terms, the cost of disasters which have affected this country in loss of life and injury, property destruction and social and economic loss has been considerable. This loss would have been significantly greater if it had not been for the great work carried out by the State Emergency Service throughout New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The State Emergency Service has two primary functions under the State Emergency Act 1987: firstly, to act as a combat agency for dealing with floods, including the establishment of flood warnings, and to coordinate the evacuation of affected communities; and, secondly, to act as a combat agency for damage control for storms and tempest and to coordinate the evacuation and welfare of affected communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sydney western division comprises of 14 local headquarters ranging from Ashfield through to the Blue Mountains. Last month I had the honour of attending the annual end of year presentation day of the Blacktown State Emergency Service. As part of the proceedings on that day, the controller of the Blacktown service, Mr Gary Fry, gave a detailed report of the services over the preceding 12 months. Gary detailed numerous calls for assistance from distressed residents because of damage caused by gale force winds, lightning, flash flooding and motor vehicle accidents. Assistance was also given by the SES in relation to a number of chemical spills and also to various community organisations such as the Smith Family, school displays, fun runs and RSL marches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most hectic period this service experienced commenced in the early hours of Saturday morning, 31 August when a vicious gale struck the Sydney metropolitan area causing damage totalling over $50 million. Over the next seven days, from 31 August to 6 September, the service responded to over 212 requests for assistance across almost <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8440"> every suburb in the area affected. Man-hours for this operation were considerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To cap all this activity, the most important role carried out by the service was its involvement on three separate occasions in searches for lost children. I am pleased to advise that on each occasion the children were found safe and sound. You can gather from these brief remarks the valuable service provided by the Blacktown State Emergency Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To achieve these results, the SES&mdash;like the Defence Force&mdash;has to devote an enormous amount of time to training and planning for any possible major disaster. There may be tendencies by some people to regard the SES volunteers as unskilled and amateurish, but this is far from the truth. SES members today are required to achieve a high level of skills to achieve their objectives and, as such, are highly trained, multiskilled, unpaid professionals. On this particular presentation day, Mr Barry Wademan, the unit rescue officer, received a national medal for 17 years of dedicated service to the SES. Other certificates were received by volunteers completing training from first aid, radio communication and map reading courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Blacktown unit is also responsible for a wide range of engineering and heavy duty four&hyphen;wheel drive vehicles, flood boats and a communication van, and all require a high level of skill to maintain and operate. The Blacktown SES has a long history of service to the wider community and has assisted in such major disasters as the Granville train disaster in 1977. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A million fewer children under the age of five will die this year than in 1990, in spite of unprecedented population growth. Every year about 80 per cent of the world's children are immunised against the major childhood diseases before their first birthday. Polio is well on its way to eradication. Guinea worm, which afflicted millions in Africa and South Asia until five years ago, is now on the verge of elimination. In just five years, an additional 1&half; billion people are now using iodised salt, striking a major blow against iodine deficiency disorders and preventing mental retardation in some 12 million infants every year. More people have access to safe drinking water. Some 50 million more children are now enrolled in primary school than in 1990. Oral rehydration treatment, which prevents or treats the dehydration caused by diarrhoeal disease&mdash;the major killer of children under the age of two&mdash;has now reached 60 per cent coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the Parliamentary Association of UNICEF was pleased to host the launch by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) of the 1997 `State of the world's children' report here at Parliament House. This report, which is published annually by UNICEF, is one of the world's most respected summaries on the progress made against major specific threats to the health, education and protection of children in the developing world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Children do a variety of work in widely divergent conditions. At one end is child labour, which is exploitative, life threatening and harmful to the child's development. Extreme forms of child labour include the slavery suffered by children in bonded labour and prostitution. At the other end many children are involved in work that may be beneficial, enhancing learning skills, self&hyphen; esteem and a sense of responsibility, and which does not interfere with schooling, leisure or rest. The impact of child labour on  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8441"> the child's development is the key to determining when work is a problem for children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drawing largely on ILO data, the UNICEF report estimates some 250 million children aged five to 14 are involved in child labour in the developing world. This estimate is a sharp revision by ILO from its earlier estimate of 73 million child workers between 10 and 14 years. The majority of child labourers&mdash;153 million&mdash;live in Asia. It is estimated that 80 million children work in Africa and 17&half; million in Latin America. Many child workers are hidden from view, particularly girls doing domestic work. Their numbers push the total even higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said today, this issue must be attacked from all sides. There must be increased awareness of the problem both nationally and internationally, enforcement of existing legislation, the adoption of international law, cooperation between national governments and their police forces, extension of voluntary labour programs, the existence of strong local women's groups and NGOs and, above all, increasing access to basic education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an Australian legislator, I am proud that Australian governments, both present and previous, have taken an active approach in this region towards assisting countries of the region in working towards the elimination of child labour. As the `State of the world's children' report says, it is time morality prevailed. As we step into the next millennium, hazardous child labour must be left behind, consigned to history as completely as those other forms of slavery that it so closely resembles.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Christmas approaches, I suggest to Australian families they have no cause to be relaxed and secure about the question of employment. If you have any doubts about that, you ought to really examine the job figures of today. That is not just my view. It is also the view of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, who, when questioned today, refused on a number of occasions to nominate a time frame for a possible fall in unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australians at large ought not to be relaxed and secure about their job prospects, it is women who ought to be most concerned. The participation rate for women has dropped more this month than the rate among men. This seems to reflect a very deliberate endeavour by the government to put in place policy parameters aimed at forcing women out of the work force. I dare suggest that they are deliberate strategies, such as changes to child&hyphen;care costs. It is really about social engineering and political correctness in the mind of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABS labour force figures suggest that employment growth today is stagnant. Until the ABS data shows a more positive trend in jobs and that we lock it in, Australians cannot be relaxed and secure about their job prospects. As the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs said today, she is a friend of the trend. She ought to be concerned&mdash;and I agree with her refusal to set a time frame for a possible fall in unemployment&mdash;because the trend rate of unemployment is locked in at 8.7 per cent, the worst trend rate for almost two years. That is nothing that the government should gloat about. I know why the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has his head down at the moment. He knows that the economic strategy of this government has created economic chaos out there and a lack of confidence in the performance of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over recent months we have had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) saying, `When we fix industrial relations and we get our budget <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8444"> strategy through, all will be right on the jobs front.' Time and time again, the Prime Minister has said that to the House of Representatives. For example, on 12 September he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality is that unemployment in this country will not be turned around until the policies of the new government are allowed to operate. Those policies include the passage of the budget and the passage of the industrial relations legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem for the Prime Minister is that he now has his industrial relations and economic agenda in place and all of a sudden, over the last couple of days, we have started to see the new excuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello) ran out the new excuse earlier this week. He started to suggest that the participation rate is the cause of high unemployment in Australia. When you talk about the participation rate, it is really code for the fact that women now feel as though they have a right to participate on an equal basis in the Australian workplace. One of the real achievements of the last decade has been that women have really felt confident enough, because there was a government in place that supported their aspirations and desires, to actually go out into the workplace. If this government has a problem with the participation rate, all I can say is that we were prepared to cope with that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the information of the House, if the participation rate were the same now as it was when John Howard was last the Treasurer, Australia's unemployment rate would be 3.3 per cent. So code for participation rate is opportunity being withdrawn from women. It is making it hard to get access to child care and is saying to women that, because of the increase in the cost of access to nursing homes, your job is now back to being a carer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is a 1950s concept. It is a concept embraced and supported by the Prime Minister. It is not about choice. It is about conscription back into the home. It is about the withdrawal of opportunities for women. When the Treasurer raises the participation rate it is code for saying to women, `You are no longer wel come in the Australian workplace. Your job is as a carer in the home. We do not regard you as equal participants in the Australian workplace. We are going to attack your industrial rights.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Garrawarra Centre for Aged Care</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="8444" TIME="5.45 p.m." SPEAKER="Vale, Danna, MP" NAMEID="VK6" ELECTORATE="Hughes" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VK6">Mrs VALE</NAME>
<ELECTORATE> (Hughes)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.45 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of this House a matter which depicts the conflict between ordinary Australians and the bureaucratic structures which increasingly govern our lives. The matter raises questions of paternalism in regard to the treatment of aged and vulnerable people. The Garrawarra Centre for Aged Care, which lies just south of Waterfall within my electorate of Hughes, was initially built in 1907 as a sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis. The architecture and approaches to care depicted those of the 19th century and reflected a need to separate people with this affliction from main society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the purposes for its use changed from tuberculosis to aged care in the 1960s, no significant capital works occurred over the years and neither have they occurred since. Within this system, a culture of paternalism, lack of privacy and overcrowding persisted until the last decade. In fact, the culture was more akin to that of a 19th century poorhouse than that of a modern aged care facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did different governments and state health bureaucracies allow this to persist? Perhaps it was because its residents were basically asset poor and suffered from conditions&mdash;such as frailty, dementia and chronic physical impairments mixed with increasing age&mdash;which made advocacy virtually impossible. Through these times the staff gave care of the highest order, but in conditions which prevented anything but the basic needs being satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the enlightened term of the previous Fahey and Greiner state governments, it appeared that a new era was dawning in this institution. Capital development plans were drawn up, a new village complex was proposed and advanced to the procurement phase and a commitment to the care of people with a dementing illness was strongly indicated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8445">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a change in the area health board and state government in New South Wales, all of these proposals were aborted and a downsizing process commenced. This process occurred under the guise of the Commonwealth&hyphen;state agreement in regard to state government nursing homes. It appears that the process was initiated with some secrecy and to those involved at the grassroots level the process has not been transparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me document the facts. From an initial 280 bed nursing home complex associated with a 28 bed hostel, the centre has now been reduced to 250 beds. Under the new proposals, it will be reduced to 120 beds. The hostel will be phased out. One hundred of these beds are to be allocated to the Illawarra area which leaves the Sutherland shire, with its 200,000&hyphen;plus population and a rapidly expanding aged sector, left in a deficit position with regard to the stringent Commonwealth nursing home ratio of 40 beds per 1,000 residents 70 years and over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation will be even more devastating as the centre has developed programs for those persons who have severe challenging behaviours associated with dementia. The residents from this category have been accepted from both the Sutherland and the Illawarra areas because of the extenuating circumstances which preclude them from being placed in traditional nursing homes. There are 80 such persons in the Garrawarra Centre which gives some indication of the magnitude of the problem being discussed. The centre has also initiated nursing development units dealing especially with the palliation of long&hyphen;term dementia sufferers once they are less mobile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes being pursued in regard to this Commonwealth&hyphen;state agreement have occurred in the absence of any resident, carer or consumer consultation. This is almost inconceivable in 1996. In fact, if this had occurred in the non-government or profit sector, the Commonwealth or state bureaucracies would have unleashed their wrath and power to prevent such actions being taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compounding the situation is the fact that there is no guarantee that the money saved will be redirected into aged care or that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> promised capital rebuilding for dementia care will actually be pursued. Given the track record of these matters, it might be predicted that the alternative will happen. Although the analogy is odious, the process being observed here is very similar to that which was experienced by the Scots in the clearances of the last century. This act allowed disempowered people being moved and relocated for economic ends without consultation or guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people who are affected are among the most disadvantaged and powerless in our society. These are our elders. They deserve better and in this proposal they appear to have been betrayed by bureaucratic double speak. My concern is not that the conditions of accommodation and care at the Garrawarra Centre should be improved. It is that under these governmental agreements the specialised care given at Garrawarra will disappear altogether, that money saved will disappear into the abyss of state Treasury and the citizens of my electorate will be seriously disadvantaged by these processes.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Mr Howard became Prime Minister he promised new and higher standards for this parliament. We have seen a minister and a parliamentary secretary resign from the ministry because they did not conform to the ministerial code of conduct. We have seen other ministers stay on in the ministry because the Prime Minister has now walked away from his own ministerial code of conduct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the parliament, we have witnessed a couple of things. Firstly, we are sitting longer, but there is no net gain in available time. Secondly, we have seen one of the most important institutions of the parliament, the committee system of the House of Representatives and the Senate, severely restricted and cut back so that they are unable to fully perform the functions that they were designed for. If they are still performing they are certainly not growing and developing as they should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point out to the House that I had four notices of motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8446"> specifically designed to pick up some of the alleged new standards that the Prime Minister talked about. At the end of the first year of the Howard government you cannot point to one reform. There is a notice of motion relating to question time which seeks to limit the time for a question and the time for the answer. We have not even been permitted to have a debate on that. I would have thought that the notice of motion relating to gagging the debate on a dissent from the Speaker's ruling would have at least merited discussion in this place. We have witnessed already in one dissent debate speakers being gagged and the Speaker's ruling left undefended by the government. What a pitiful situation.</PARA>

It is true&mdash;I do not say this about Speaker Halverson&mdash;that it has been traditional for Speakers of this House to resist setting up such a committee. It is well known that the overseas travel by the President and the Speaker, because they are in the Department of the House of Representatives, which is not scrutinised, can be buried. The staffing and appropriations committee would have far more functions than just dealing with that matter. I say to Speaker Halverson&mdash;I reproach his predecessors&mdash;that we really do need a staffing and appropriations committee, the need for which was no more evident than when we were hacking and slashing the committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth notice of motion I put forward was to have a new form of private members business&mdash;constituency statements in the Main Committee. This would be of three minutes duration and each week 20 minutes would be allocated to each side of the House, which would allow members to be seen to be responding to those things that were of a priority, of an urgent nature, or which needed publicising in their own constituencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not one of these propositions has merited a discussion. Indeed, it is always up to the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) to pick them up, and I have invited him to do so. Even if he cannot himself come to grips with the propositions, at the very least they could be referred to the Procedure Committee. I must <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> admit I regret that I am no longer a member of that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make is this: it is no good talking about the higher standards required in the parliament and not living up to them, whether that refers to ministerial conduct&mdash;it is a matter of pity that the former Liberal Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, would not have hesitated; you would have seen more ministers go&mdash;or whether it refers to the issues that I have raised by way of notice of motion. I think it is a condemnation of the government and Mr Howard's advice of higher standards that not one of these notices has been debated or discussed in this parliament or in this House, picked up by the Leader of the House or, indeed, referred to the Procedure Committee. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House a matter of grave concern for the small business sector of Australia and the community at large. It concerns the harsh, unconscionable and deceptive conduct of a publicly listed company, Berklee Ltd, an exhaust component manufacturer from Ballarat Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Early in 1988 Mr Sid O'Toole, now a constituent in the Capricornia electorate, decided to investigate the possibility of going into small business. During a meeting with the national marketing manager of Berklee Retail, Mr O'Toole was told the Rockhampton store, which he was contemplating buying, was the most successful in Australia and that it was one of a few yet to be converted to their franchise. The marketing manager also told Mr O'Toole that there were 120 franchised stores Australia-wide and that not one of them had ever gone bankrupt. In addition to this, he told Mr O'Toole that 50 per cent of the royalty payments made by the franchisees would be spent on advertising, promotion and marketing, demographic surveys, store assistance and staff training. It all sounded good so Mr O'Toole made the commitment and purchased the store and its assets to operate as a Berklee franchise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1989, in support of what management was saying verbally, Berklee Retail issued a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8447"> booklet on their franchise system titled `The Berklee way&mdash;making money'. This booklet stated that over 100 Berklee Australia exhaust centres operated across the nation. The booklet went on to say what franchising involved and how it operated. Then, in March 1990, the company issued a company video which stated they had 120 franchised outlets across Australia. Both the booklet and the video promoted the same information management was telling Mr O'Toole to convince him to take the Rockhampton business. As it turned out, the company had only 25 franchised stores at the time and failed to meet any of the commitments and promises they had made. These were all blatant untruths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now evident that Berklee Retail, under the auspices Berklee Ltd, deceived and induced people through its management and its promotional literature to become franchisees on the pretext that they were experienced franchisors; that there were more franchisees than were actually operating; and, that big profits were there for the taking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable members would be aware, section 52 of the Trade Practices Act precludes misleading and deceptive conduct. The misrepresentations made by Berklee to its dozens of franchisees and potential franchisees clearly breach this section. There were a number of other promises Berklee made that can be proved to be misleading and deceptive conduct and a breach of section 52 of the Trade Practices Act. Berklee promised franchisees the exclusive right to distribute Berklee products. This only lasted about 18 months before they removed their embossed name off their product from 1 July 1989, and began to flood independent stores&mdash;not, I might add, with a different product but with the same product. This action alone destroyed their own franchise operation completely and took with it almost every one of the 40 franchise operators and their investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further breaches of section 52 of the Trade Practices Act are as follows. Although promised time and time again, there was no company plan to guide these franchisees and there was no in&hyphen;store training by competent staff employed by Berklee Retail. There was no back-up and support for these franchisees, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such as computer packages to control the business or a proper financial profile of a model store and a demographic report based on the exigencies of the franchise agreements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in this discussion this morning. I would like at the outset to express my sincere condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims of both the Monarch and the Seaview Air crashes. No matter how much examination and review we have of the circumstances of both of those crashes, it will not change anything. I am sure everybody in this place joins with me in expressing our heartfelt sympathy and understanding to the families of the victims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the response by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to Commissioner Staunton's Seaview Air report and, more latterly, to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane Safe</EMPHASIS> report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I will elaborate on those a little bit further as I go along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Seaview Air report is an exhaustive report. It was a very expensive report. It was spread out over a long period. I think there are explanations for that, and those who are associated with it well understand them. I think they will bring up their priorities again in another place at another time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 27 June in this chamber and in the main chamber on 27 June, I expressed my grave concerns about events related to aviation safety in this country, the direction in which the government was heading, and some of the statements being made by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I have expressed those views to him privately. What I am saying now is not something that I have not expressed to him directly or in this place or in the other place on earlier occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work that was done by the commission of inquiry did pick up the work that was carried out by the inquiry. It was a good example of the two activities working together to minimise expense to the taxpayer and to draw on the information, not duplicating the process that was well under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work that was done by Commissioner Staunton, as I said, is exhaustive. But, looking back through it, the question is what the problem was with the Civil Aviation Authority, as it was then known. More latterly, there has been an attempt to ascribe it to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and&mdash;as the reference is in here&mdash;to the timidity of the Civil Aviation Authority at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems of that timidity and the lack of will in enforcing its responsibilities are rooted in the dramatic and utterly inappropriate change in philosophy and direction of the Civil Aviation Authority brought about by the Chairman, Dick Smith, and the Chief Executive Officer, Frank Baldwin, in 1991. That change in philosophy represented the aviation industry as a customer.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8745">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The early report that came forward dealing with the same subject was a coronial inquiry into the Monarch air disaster. I will quote from this document and from a number of other documents in the time I have this morning, just to get these statements together in the one place, on the record, and in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the Monarch, on page 8 of the report the coroner said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A former chairman of the CAA had advocated a policy of "affordable safety" which favoured a very lenient approach to policing the regulations. "Affordable safety" does not necessarily equate to "necessary safety"; in effect, it was up to each airline to decide if it was affordable to fly safely. If a plane crashes, the airline is up for the cost of the plane; if the passengers and pilots are killed or injured and the airline has no assets or insurance to cover that contingency then the risk is "affordable" to the airline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CAA's motto was "a safe and viable industry" but the senior echelons of the CAA placed undue emphasis on promoting a "viable" industry and, as a consequence, were loath to prosecute airlines for breaches of the Regulations or to revoke an AOC and this had the effect on the Airworthiness and Flight Operations Branches which were responsible for policing the Regulations. Internal memos passing between inspectors show they resented the restrictions imposed on them by their superiors . . . The effect of all this was that inspectors were unable to take any action against airlines for breaches of the regulations apart from giving warnings and so&hyphen;called counselling.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is the underpinning. This is where it all began, in that change in philosophy, that change in culture concerning the regulator's role. The primary consideration of the people that are there to ensure that airlines and air services are operated safely was the financial viability of the operator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now let me turn to Commissioner Staunton's report. On page 92 of his report, the section dealing with the industry as a customer, pararaph 3.16, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accompanying these changes were subtle, and not&hyphen;so&hyphen;subtle, changes of philosophy. The Chairman, Mr Smith, made the following comments in the annual report for 1989&hyphen;90:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The CAA's future is inextricably linked to the future of the aviation industry . . . It follows that what is good for the aviation industry&mdash;high safety, lower costs, more aircraft in the air, few delays, more people flying&mdash;is also good for the CAA.'</PARA>
<PARA>Further, in paragraph 3.17, referring to the review of resources, it says that CAA's core values include being customer orientated. Then we go over to paragraph 3.21. Again, I am quoting directly from Staunton's report on CAA strategies designed to reduce the cost of aviation services to industry, which include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen; <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> emphasising the importance of the customer's needs, customer service and the cost of the service we provide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen; <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the need to be more transparent to customers.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on as I move through the report, 3.9, 3.20, then these words of Commissioner Staunton contain a steely message clothed in cotton wool, and I ask members of the parliament to look a little bit more deeply behind what Staunton was really saying. For the sake of propriety, the words are carefully couched, gently. In 3.30 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Dick Smith ceased to be Chairman of the CAA in February 1992. Mr Baldwin resigned as Chief Executive Officer in February 1993. Nonetheless, the concept of the industry as the customer of the CAA remained, at least for some time. In a memorandum that achieved some notoriety, Mr Cannane, then the Airworthiness Manager of the Bankstown District Office, directed his officers in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Some of you may think that this was Black Friday at its worst and some may think that what I said was overly harsh and not to your liking . . . Some may question the fact that their jobs, and I include my own, have been threatened if we do not perform our duties in the manner as required by your <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8746"> management. If this comes as a surprise to anyone, then it is time that you got your head out of the clouds.'</PARA>
<PARA>Staunton says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Cannane did not mince words. He said this:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`You are a servant of the industry whether you like it or not. Even when performing your regulative role you are still a servant of the Industry to which you owe your existence.'</PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on in this letter:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Improve your salesmanship. This means that you will be a servant to our customer, the Industry, that you serve and monitor. They are our customers, service and regulatory, and if we don't have customers then we don't have jobs . . . Anyone acting like a bureaucrat is not performing their duty in a manner acceptable to this management and will not be tolerated.'</PARA>
<PARA>These quotes are from a memo sent round from on high, and these are the officers at the coalface trying to ensure that aircraft are airworthy, aircrew are properly qualified and all the things that need to be done to ensure safe air transport are done. Here is the fundamental conflict: that they are our customers&mdash;service and regulatory&mdash;and that if we do not have customers then we do not have jobs. To me, that is like a policeman going on the street and saying, `Well, if we don't have any burglars, I'm out of a job. We've got to have burglars, otherwise I don't have a job, so we'll catch some but we'll leave others there to keep us all in employment.' It would be ludicrous if it were not so serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the roots of the problem within the Civil Aviation Authority at that time; that confusion of roles, the contradiction in messages and culture coming down from the board itself. That flowed on to intimidation of staff, and the staff themselves being afraid to carry out their responsibilities. As I move through it, I keep coming back to the problem that the emphasis is upon general aviation, charter operators, recreational flyers, when the reality in this country is that, when we look to the carriage of domestic passengers in 1995&hyphen;96 that were carried by the major airlines and the regional airlines, 27.7 million people travelled by air in 1995&hyphen;96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If we take into that the international passengers who arrived in Australian airspace and transited in Australian airports, there are a further 12.1 million people. So, overall, there are 40 million people travelling by air in a year in Australia, and there is no reference in any of this stuff to them. All the noise we hear and all the hoo&hyphen;ha we have going on is about the recreational flyers, the weekend warriors. All we hear is whether Mr Smith should be chairman, and whether the board should have somebody on it who has had aviation experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to repeat all of the words that I have used before on this issue. But, I am pleased to see that the minister is now picking up the recommendations, both of Commissioner Staunton and of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane Safe</EMPHASIS> report. Undoubtedly, he had a major role in that, along with myself as chair. That was a job that was done to improve safety for everybody. It is a contradiction when the minister in his statement in respect of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane Safe</EMPHASIS> report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian aviation industry has some of the most professional personnel in the world and they have helped maintain our international standing in aviation safety.</PARA>
<PARA>True. But we ought to be concentrating on ensuring that they are performing their task to the required standards of safety and not obsessing ourselves with what happens at the lower end of the market. Most of the activity there is private recreational, self activity, not the 40 million people who use aviation services each year&mdash;domestic, regional and international.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8747">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, this incongruent approach where we hear a tremendous amount of noise from the small players and absolute silence from Ansett, Qantas, and the Board of International Airlines&mdash;they represent all of the international airlines operating into this country. In this committee this morning, I call upon Ansett, Qantas, the Regional Airlines Association, and the Board of International Airlines representatives to take up their responsibility and to play a more overt and effective role in respect of aviation safety in this country. What we have had is the tip of the tail wagging the dog, and some personality relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot have people going around the aviation industry saying, `Dick Smith is  wonderful bloke. He raised $6 million for the government's election campaign.' That is what is on the grapevine. I do not know whether it is true. They are the figures that I have been told. Great bloke. I am not concerned whether he is a great bloke. What I am concerned about are the 40 million people who are entitled to a proper standard of aviation safety when they use the aviation services of this country. It is not good enough for the major carriers to sit mute and have this image peddled across to the Australian public that their interests are not being protected. If they are not being protected, then it is time that Ansett, Qantas, the Board of International Airlines representatives, and the Regional Airlines Association started to speak out and express their concerns and their priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, the committees that have been formed, the measures that are being implemented now, the random checks on stocks of parts to ensure that bogus parts are not in the system and are not being utilised in aircraft, the random checks in respect of charter operators, are all steps in the right direction. I am appealing to the minister this morning to put aside his obsession with the members of the board and to concentrate on lifting the morale of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority itself. You cannot have confidence and pride in what you do, when your boss is kicking you in the guts all the time anonymously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The briefing that we had yesterday&mdash;and I notice the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Micro&hyphen;economic Reform has now joined us&mdash;from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority does give one hope and heart for improvement. I thought that it was professional, but it recognises the history of the problems, too, and the fact that they are now pulling together and rebuilding. The principles are under way to work together with those in the industry who accept their safety responsibility. `Who accept their safety responsibility' are the critical words in that. There must be a vigorous pursuit of those who choose not to operate in compliance, and the adoption of a safety system assessment as a base of regulatory approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall the report is exhaustive. It deals with one tragedy in the history of aviation of this country. Our report from the committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane Safe</EMPHASIS> dealt with the general aviation industry as a whole but they complement each other. I am pleased that the report has been concluded. I congratulate Commissioner Staunton and those who worked with him on their efforts in that report and I welcome the response of the government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened carefully and in a very interested frame of mind to the remarks of the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who has great experience in this area. I found his contribution very useful. But I would just remind him of some observations that were made in an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  on 9 June 1996 which I think emphasises that an overall balance has to be struck in looking at this particular matter. The particular editorial says in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8748">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps too the blame must rest with those who conceived the so&hyphen;called review of resources within the CAA which saw an exodus of some of the organisation's best and brightest. The review of resources will forever stand as an example of how not to trim a corpulent organisation, of retaining too much chaff and too little wheat. Much is made of the fact that Dick Smith was Chairman of the CAA during the review of resources period. It is suggested that Mr Smith's embrace of the notion of affordable safety contributed to laxity which led to the Monarch and Seaview tragedies. Does this make Mr Smith a scapegoat? Probably. Mr Smith cannot walk away from his chairmanship of the CAA blameless but nor should he be pilloried for policies which were endorsed by the government of the day and which clearly were actively pursued by other members of the CAA board.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend the whole of that particular editorial to honourable members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has had an excellent record for air safety and, as has been said by previous speakers, there are a large number of passenger movements in this country&mdash;approximately 40 million per year international and domestic. This calls therefore for the highest degree of circumspection and regulation in order that the safety of those people is paramount in the eyes of the regulators of air safety. In other words, well may the standards be kept high. There is an extremely high onus on government to ensure absolute safety and imbue absolute confidence in the travelling public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the large number of people who are travelling, the large number of movements and its importance on the overall Australian economy, it would seem indeed not so much importance but it is a fact of life that all of us from time to time need to travel. Particularly in commercial and cargo movements, it is almost without question, I would have thought, that we need to ensure the safest airline system, the safest system of managing and assisting aircraft movements that we can possibly have. There really is no argument in my view for trimming air safety. We must have absolute confidence in the safety of our airlines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that the inquiry into the Seaview disaster revealed a number of disturbing elements, in particular, the fact that the flight in question was overloaded by something of the order, on one view&mdash;the view most favourable to Seaview&mdash;of 220 kilograms and, at the other end of scale, 288 kilograms. That is substantial overloading having regard to the size of the aircraft and the number of passengers on board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pilot's licence was not valid. There were unsatisfactory work practices adopted by the airline, including understating of hours to avoid fatigue regulations, overstating of hours to inflate pilot experience and to earn the pilot a licence in a different category sooner than he or she would otherwise be able to, and subtle pressure on the employees of the airline to flout regulations, that subtle pressure coming from the management. But even more disturbing, in my view, has been the role of the CAA which, in a sense, reminds me of Mount Erebus revisited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you may have had the opportunity to read the book by Mr Justice Mahon who, you might remember, was the commissioner who investigated the Erebus disaster. His report was not accepted by the New Zealand government. Indeed, a monumental exercise in government thuggery occurred at that time in an attempt to try to water down the strong criticism of Air New Zealand by Mr Justice Mahon, and the criticism of the senior bureaucrats from Air New Zealand and other people involved in safety who came before his commission. I wish I could remember his famous phrase describing that evidence&mdash;I have used it in court a few times myself. It really emphasised how disturbing it was that these bureaucrats could get together and cover up, and attempt to do a snow job, as they say. And it appears that this has occurred in relation to the CAA here.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8749">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an attempt&mdash;and a successful attempt, it would seem&mdash;on the part of some bureaucrats to snow the former board. Indeed, it seems that that may have been carried over to the new board. I was particularly concerned in relation to one of the so&hyphen;called whistleblowers, Mr Bob Hoy, who was the district airworthiness manager at Coffs Harbour. He urged suspension of the company's air operators certificate. This occurred in the year of the tragedy, on 13 January 1994. Then on 16 April he went to Canberra to see the then chief executive of the CAA, Mr Doug Roser, to press his concern. Yet these warnings were ignored. Mr Hoy was doing not only what he was paid to do but what was expected of him. He was insisting on standards, on compliance with safety regulations, yet he was perceived by his superiors to be out of step and was subsequently persecuted&mdash;hence I say the revisiting of the Erebus situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That sort of behaviour is totally unacceptable, in my view, in looking at the question of air safety. We cannot be too diligent. We cannot be too prescriptive. We cannot be too bureaucratic in many respects in regulating air safety because lives are at stake. There are no second chances, as the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) mentioned. In an aircraft crash there are rarely, if ever, survivors. So there are no second chances if there is a slight lapse in regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What concerns me is the attitude of the new board that seems to be exemplified in statements that have been revealed which highlight what I see as the incongruity&mdash;and this is a slightly wider issue&mdash;of having a judge run a government board. It is really, in my view, inappropriate for judges to be involved in running government appointed boards. Here we have a judge who goes into the media and says in relation to the inquiry of Commissioner Staunton when looking at the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that the errors that were made were not errors of expertise.</PARA>
<PARA>Having regard to the report itself, that really is quite an absurd statement and unfortunately exposes the judge to criticism which, in my view, tends to undermine the judiciary as a whole. This is a wider issue but, when a judge is in this position, he is placed in this position by the government of the day by being offered an appointment of this nature. Overall, this can tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. It is an inappropriate decision in my view to appoint judges to these boards, and it is something that should be discouraged in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in addition to that, the board itself, in my view, leaves a question mark over the expertise of members of that board. In reality, only one person has relevant aviation experience. With all due respect to the other members of the board, is it really appropriate that people with little or no experience of practical aviation even consider themselves? If they examined their own position before accepting such appointments, should they not really look very carefully at whether or not they feel they should accept positions of this nature?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the government have made the offer, and maybe it starts with the government&mdash;this was the previous government I am speaking of&mdash;but the fact of the matter is it is also something that I would have thought they need to examine themselves. More particularly now that we have had quite trenchant criticism of the board by the minister, and criticism with which I respectfully agree, it is my view that the board really has to take a good hard look at itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, as far as the operator of this particular airline is concerned, it to me is absolutely on its face inexcusable that when that aircraft disappeared about 1&half; hours elapsed before anyone was notified. Having regard to the recommendation for a criminal prosecution <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8750"> of the owner, I think that really is something that might well be taken into account by a court in determining how it should regard the overall operation of that particular airline and the behaviour of its owner in the context of both its slipshod operation and what appears, on its face, an inexcusable delay when the lives of these people were tragically lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I too extend my sympathy to the families of those victims. I express the wish that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) maintains the reform process that he has flagged and that we will re&hyphen;engender a good degree of confidence in the industry in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.29 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In opening my comments on this report this morning, I too would extend my sympathies to the families. It was an incident in Australian aviation history that tore at the heart of all Australians, and one that engenders a lot of trepidation in some of the travelling public in Australia. When people line up to buy a ticket to travel on an aircraft somewhere, whether it be a small aircraft such as that that was involved in this incident or a 747&hyphen;400 to travel overseas or a 737 to travel from Canberra to Sydney, there is an unquestionable expectation that the airworthiness of the aircraft being used in that flight has the clear imprimatur of the Commonwealth and of the people that are responsible for safety regulation. The travelling public in this country boards aircraft without giving a second thought to any malfunction that may happen or any incident that may lie ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As a nation of air travellers in the world today, we are singly very lucky with the low number of accidents such as this. Certainly, this very tragic and apparently avoidable accident has brought to the fore a number of deficiencies that existed in the system at the time. I go back to an inquiry in late 1993 when I was a member of the then Joint Committee of Public Accounts. We were conducting an inquiry into the commercialisation of the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority and the ways that had impacted on the services being provided by those two organisations in relation to their direct ownership by the taxpayers of Australia. More importantly, we were examining the safety elements involved in air traffic control and safety surveillance, and surveillance of the regulations that were supposed to be enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when the CAA was commercialised, those activities of air traffic control and safety surveillance were all in the one organisation. They were all being run together. We had the opportunity at a public hearing in Sydney of taking evidence from the then Chief Executive Officer, Doug Roser, and the then Director of Safety Regulations, George Marcionis, both of whom appear in this report. They were called to give evidence before this royal commission. From memory, at the public hearing, the evidence that we took from those gentlemen was after the Monarch crash, but before the Seaview crash. I had asked questions at that stage of Marcionis whether he was satisfied that the way the CAA was implementing safety regulations and surveillance was satisfactory. I am sure that if we look in the records from that hearing that the evidence given from him was that it was, that the likes of Monarch would not happen again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that following the Monarch crash, in a speech that the then shadow minister, the now Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) gave in the House of Representatives, he indicated that he had concerns about the operations of Seaview prior to this incident. In the subsequent report of that inquiry by the Public Accounts Committee, we highlighted the dangers of having a safety regulator commercialised and operating on a commercial basis. The focus could be, and evidently was, too much on the commercial <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8751"> imperatives of the organisation rather than on the overwhelming responsibility that was cast upon them to ensure that the air travelling public in Australia was safe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) who spoke a while ago with regard to the focus being on the bottom end of the market, as it were, or on general aviation, and that there is a responsibility for the other 40 million travelling public. But this incident happened in the middle with RPT/charter operators that were working at the margin, I suppose. Maybe, the financial viability of their organisations was questionable but, just the same, as I said before, the people that bought tickets to travel on this aircraft to Lord Howe Island were entitled to the same expectation of safety as the person buying a ticket on 747&hyphen;400 of Qantas to travel overseas. As a government we have a responsibility to ensure that in the future such accidents do not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the opportunity of having a briefing yesterday from CASA staff, and there is no doubt that there is an enormous change in attitude following our recommendation of the JCPA that the responsibilities and activities of air traffic control be separated from safety regulation. Subsequently, the government of the day created Airservices Australia which is a corporate entity running as a business, controlling air traffic in our skies, and bringing safety regulations and safety surveillance back in as an agency to surveil the safety operations in the aviation sector in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly was heartened yesterday to be briefed by CASA on what they are doing, how they are going to operate and the new focus of the organisation. We note the recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane Safe</EMPHASIS> report of the former Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, chaired by the member for Shortland, in the last parliament. Those recommendations have been taken up by the government. The now minister was a member of that committee in the last parliament. He participated in the complete inquiry that resulted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane Safe</EMPHASIS> report. So there is a commitment throughout this parliament to improve the regulation of the safety aspects of aviation in Australia today. I commend that to all members because it is of paramount importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue that has been referred to here this morning is the tension that apparently exists between the minister and some members of the board of CASA. That is, I think, a result of some differences of opinion as to what sorts of expertise should exist on that board&mdash;for example, the question of whether direct aviation experience is necessary on that board. A lot of us believe that it is, but that is one issue&mdash;previous speakers have alluded to the fact that it may or may not be having an impact on morale within CASA. I am sure it will sort itself out but the main object of the exercise at the moment for the government, for the department and for CASA is to improve immeasurably on what has happened in the past but certainly to restructure the organisation and the focus of the organisation so that they realise and they are committed to what they are there for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the briefing that we received yesterday, I am sure that that is going to occur. There is a commitment by the minister to ensure that that happens and to ensure that when we buy a ticket to travel on an aircraft somewhere we can do that in the complete confidence that we are travelling very safely, unlike the case in a lot of other countries in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the dramatic increase in the amount of air travel around the world, the responsibilities incumbent on CASA are not only to surveil aircraft that originate out of this country but also to surveil aircraft that travel into and out of Australia&mdash;foreign carriers&mdash;which, from time to time, carry Australian nationals. Those aircraft, as we have seen, can certainly make a big hole <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8752"> in the ground and they can be very dangerous. There was a recent incident in New Delhi and neither of those aircraft were Indian national aircraft, they were foreign carriers but they were operating in that country and carrying some of their nationals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a responsibility, and a growing responsibility, on CASA to surveil aircraft that are operating in and out of Australia because, from time to time, we do travel with those airlines. There is a growing concern in that area. CASA are aware of it and are implementing measures to do that. As a parliament and certainly as a government, we are going to support CASA. I know the minister is supporting them with the new regime they are implementing with regard to the management of CASA, particularly as a result of those tragedies, originally with Monarch and, more importantly today, with the inquiry of the royal commission that was conducted into the tragedy of that Seaview flight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend Commissioner Staunton on the work he has done in this report and I am sure that all members are cognisant of what needs to be achieved in the future after the tragedy of the Seaview air crash.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A proprietary company will be classified as a large proprietary company, and thus be required to have its accounts audited under the Corporations Law, where it and the entities that it controls meet 2 of the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> consolidated gross operating revenue of $10 million or more;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> consolidated gross assets of $5 million or more; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 50 or more employees at the end of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answers to the specific matters raised in the question are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Each large proprietary company that was formerly classified as an exempt proprietary company will be required to have its accounts audited for the first financial year of the company that commences after 9 December 1995. This requirement will apply irrespective of whether a company's shareholders are directors of the company or are otherwise engaged in the management of the company. Companies meeting the large proprietary company test are significant enterprises and generally have a number of creditors or members with an interest in the company's accounts.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8953"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporations Law does, however, provide that the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) may relieve a large proprietary company of the obligation to have its accounts audited where the audit would impose an unreasonable burden on the company. In considering whether to provide such relief, the ASC must have regard to, inter alia, the expected costs of complying with the audit requirements and the expected benefits of having the company comply with those requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 19 November 1996 the ASC released its audit relief policy for large proprietary companies (Policy Statement Number 115). The audit relief policy permits large proprietary companies that have not been audited since 1993:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to continue to prepare and lodge unaudited accounts for the first financial year commencing after 9 December 1995; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to apply for ongoing relief from the requirement to be audited for the second financial year commencing after 9 December 1995, where they can satisfy criteria demonstrating that they are well managed and in sound financial position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A small proprietary company will not be required to appoint an auditor unless:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it is a disclosing entity as defined in the Corporations Law; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it is controlled by a foreign company and its profit or loss for the period is not included in the foreign company's accounts; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it is subject to a shareholder request to prepare audited accounts; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it is required by the ASC to lodge audited accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) See introductory comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) I am advised that the question whether the accounts for 1995&hyphen;96 will have to be audited to avoid having the accounts for 1996&hyphen;97 qualified will be a matter for consideration by each company and its auditor. An auditor, in forming a view on this matter, would be guided by his or her professional judgement. The final decision would be based on a consideration of issues such as the level of reliance that can be placed on the accounting records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) I am advised that no Treasury or Australian Securities Commission estimate of the average cost of compliance with the audit requirements is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> available. I would expect the audit fee to be determined by factors such as the form in which the accounting records are maintained and the adequacy of those records, the nature and adequacy of the company's internal controls, the number of transactions and the geographical spread of the company's operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) The Government remains firmly committed to reducing the regulation and compliance costs for all levels of business. The small/large test for proprietary companies will be reviewed after 2 years operation of the legislation to ensure that its practical operation does not place an undue burden on business.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Recommendation 116 of the Report on the Child Support Scheme by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues recommended that "the Minister for Social Security commissions an independent study into the costs of children to enable a critical evaluation of the current child support formula percentages".</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) A number of approaches are possible for determining the costs of children.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(d) The costs of children research is being undertaken as part of a larger research project to develop indicative Budget Standards for a range of different household configurations, including families with children in a variety of employment and housing circumstances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes, the Child Support Agency made two submissions to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. The first referred to the non&hyphen;custodial parent's `exempted income amount' at various points. It also referred to the non&hyphen;custodial parent's `self support component' at various points. At page 124 it said, "(the current legislation sets two income figures which could be said to represent the concept of self support. There is a basic amount used in the assessment (self support <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8960"> exemption called the exempted income amount) and there is a second amount when it comes to collection from an employee's pay (the protected earnings amount))."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Exempted income amount' appeared in a glossary of terms, and was defined as "that part of the non&hyphen;custodial parent's taxable income which is not taken into account in assessing child support, that is, the single pension rate if there are no other children or the married pension rate plus an allowance for each child if there are other dependent children." `Self support component' did not appear in this glossary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No, the `exempted income amount' and the `self support component' are not different concepts, but different ways of expressing the same concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 uses the term `exempted income amount', with its meaning given by section 39. `Self support component' was used by the Agency as an alternative to simplify the child support assessment formula. The Agency no longer tends to use the term `self support component'.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Child Support Review Office provides an administrative method for departing from administrative assessments raised under Child Support legislation. The Child Support Review Office does not review other decisions of the Child Support Agency. Clients of the Child Support Agency have the right to object against some decisions made under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 and appeal rights are to the Family Court or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) A letter was sent to a representative of the Registered Clubs Association (RCA) of NSW on 3 October 1996 advising (on a without prejudice basis) that Keno commission income derived by registered clubs is assessable income and is not subject to the principle of mutuality. The letter did not deal with commission income from TAB operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The issue of the taxation treatment of Keno commission income arose during contact with a taxpayer during August 1996. Further investigation revealed that many clubs had assumed that the commission income was subject to the principle of mutuality and therefore not assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle of mutuality is, broadly, based upon the proposition that a taxpayer cannot derive </PARA>
<PARA><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8963"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">income from itself. Generally, under this proposition, income derived by registered clubs from their members is not treated as assessable income for taxation purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, Keno commissions are paid to clubs by Club Keno Holdings Pty Ltd and are not derived from club members. Under the same principle, commissions paid to clubs by the TAB are assessable income, not tax exempt mutual income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the widespread misunderstanding of the tax status of the commission income, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is attempting to resolve this matter in close consultation with the registered club industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No. The ATO has not determined the tax liability of clubs at this time. It is true that Keno has been operating in NSW since September 1991, but as already noted, the ATO is negotiating with the registered club industry to resolve the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)(a) and (b) No estimates of revenue collections for tax on Keno commission income have been made for the five year period or on an annual basis. However, the following gross commission income was derived by licensed clubs in NSW from Keno operations as shown in the following table:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These figures represent gross commission amounts only and there may be tax deductible expenses related to the derivation of this income. In addition, a number of clubs deriving Keno commission income are exempt from income tax and revenue collections will, therefore, be reduced accordingly. Further, a proportion of the income may already have been returned by non&hyphen;exempt clubs as part of their income derived from non&hyphen;members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) No details are available for estimated revenue collections for licensed clubs deriving Keno commission income in the electoral division of Barton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The taxation treatment of Keno and TAB commission income is being determined under existing taxation law. Registered clubs have incorrectly assumed that the commission income is exempt when it has always been taxable under the law. Clearly no new `tax' is involved.</PARA>
