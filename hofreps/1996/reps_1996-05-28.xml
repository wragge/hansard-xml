<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Yesterday, the minister told the House that neither he nor any of his frontbench colleagues gave any undertakings or made any secret deals with developers wanting to construct a second Sydney airport at Holsworthy. Has the minister seen reports in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>  of 24 May 1996 which read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior coalition MPs held confidential negotiations with a consortium last year and agreed not to make the details public until after the election.</PARA>
<PARA>And also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A spokesman for transport minister John Sharp confirmed a plan was being investigated and that it had appeared last June but had not been revealed to voters in the March 2 election.</PARA>
<PARA>Will you now admit, which you failed to do yesterday, or concede that some or all of your colleagues indicated to the developers before the election a preparedness to consider Holsworthy after the election?</PARA></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We received a number of representations and submissions from people in regard to airport proposals in the years that we were in opposition&mdash;airport proposals designed to solve the problem of developing a second airport for Sydney. We received a proposal from the gentleman that the opposition leader's question is directed at, the Lawrence Hargrave project. That gentleman asked those people who were presented with that submission to keep the detail of his submission and treat it as intellectual property, which is exactly the arrangement that the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith and indeed other members of the Labor Party also complied with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We received a number of submissions from other people in relation to other airport proposals, including Holsworthy. The House would be interested to know that we received a submission from Mr Rupert Pickrell, advo cating the construction of an airport at Holsworthy. We also received a submission from the Australian International Pilots Association, who preferred a site at Holsworthy. We did not make those publicly known because there was no need to&mdash;for the same reasons that the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith did not feel it was necessary to reveal that he had had discussions in regard to people like this whilst he was the minister for transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also received submissions from a number of people in relation to airport proposals in Goulburn, Williamtown, Richmond and Wilton, and indeed we even received a proposal called the Sydney Seadrome for a floating airport off Botany Bay. If all of those proposals that we received from those people&mdash;and gave consideration to&mdash;whether it be the Australian International Pilots Association, Mr Rupert Pickrell, the Sydney Seadrome, Goulburn, Wilton, Richmond or Williamtown, were to be described as secret deals, then they are secret deals. If that is the standard you impose on yourselves in opposition, I will look forward to you revealing all your negotiations with every single person you talk to&mdash;for the public's benefit.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EM6">Mrs STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What are the public benefits in selling one&hyphen;third of Telstra? Is the government determined to press ahead with its plans to provide a cheaper and more efficient phone system for all Australians as well as lasting environmental benefits for future generations?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1493" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a large number of public benefits in a sale of one-third of Telstra&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Opposition member interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the Labor members interjected, `What about rural people?' Let me say two things about rural people and Telstra. The first thing I say is that the National Farmers Federation has given unequivocal support to the government's policy on a sale of one-third of Telstra. The second point I make is that all of the community service obligations are completely guaranteed. In other words, under our policy, the cross-subsidies for the bush in Australia will be kept 100 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of public benefit is fundamental to the sale of one-third of Telstra, and it is particularly fundamental in the ongoing debate on this issue between the House of Representatives and the Senate. I will tell the House what the Leader of the Australian Democrats had to say on 31 January, the day that I announced the then Opposition's policy on selling one-third of Telstra. It is very important that her words are recalled in the context of the stance now being taken by the opposition parties in the Senate. She had this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1494"> to say: `The Democrats have said they won't support it'&mdash;that is, the sale of one-third of Telstra&mdash;`unless there's a public benefit demonstrated.' That is probably not a bad stance to take. Demanding that there be a public benefit in a privatisation has been a principle I have enunciated, and it was also a principle enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many public benefits, one of which is that you will give a better deal to consumers&mdash;that is not a bad public benefit&mdash;via lower prices. Another public benefit is that you will have greater competition. And so it goes on. It is very interesting that, since the election, the Leader of the Democrats has sought to condemn, by reference to British Telecom, the effect of privatisation on customers and on telephone prices. In that context I have had provided to me a copy of a letter written to Senator Kernot by the Managing Director in Australia of British Telecom, Mr Steve Burden. Referring to an article written in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 22 May by Senator Kernot, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would have been preferable if you had taken the opportunity to check the facts with British Telecom before making some incorrect and misleading statements.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this will be instructive to all members of the House, and it goes very directly to the question of public benefit. This is what he had to say about British Telecom:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since privatisation in November 1995, the price of inland calls in the United Kingdom has been reduced by 53 per cent in real terms and 46 per cent for international calls.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="BEAZLEY" NAMEID="PE4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was competition.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member opposite pipes up about competition. I will come to competition in a moment, mate. Mr Burden then goes on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reductions have resulted in business calls in the United Kingdom being 34 per cent cheaper and residential calls 33 per cent cheaper than in Australia in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is ample evidence, on the precedent of British Telecom&mdash;which Senator Kernot herself sought to invoke in order to condemn the government's proposal&mdash;to demonstrate that the consumer is better off, there is more <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> competition, and there is a national benefit in privatisation. The very thing that she said before the election&mdash;remember, she leads the party that wants to keep all of us here honest&mdash;was, `If you can prove to me there's a public benefit, I'll support it.' I have demonstrated on the precedent of British Telecom, which she sought to rely on, that there is a public benefit. There is a very strong case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition earlier interjected, `What about competition?' It is appropriate that he asked that, because it is a day that there appears in the press the report of the Institute of Management Development issued annually out of Lausanne in Switzerland that lists the competitiveness of nations. Unfortunately, over the last five years, out of a table of 25 countries, in relation to competitiveness Australia has gone from a position of 16th down to 21st. It gets even worse when you start to analyse the different components that make up this aggregate competitiveness measure. There are 46 countries in the table. We are 44th on current account balance. We are 43rd on the current account as a proportion of GDP. We are 42nd on hiring and firing practices&mdash;that's not bad, is it? I thought we had a world&hyphen;class system! But this is the piece de resistance: we are 46th out of 46 on international telephone charges.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. The honourable member for Hughes has asked whether the concerns of the people that she very ably represents in this House will be considered. As honourable members on our side of the House will know, the answer to that question is that the honourable member for Hughes will represent her constituents very effectively indeed, as she has already done so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's preferred site for a second airport for Sydney is Badgerys Creek. That should never be lost in all of this. The other thing that needs to be restated, and is part of the question put by the honourable member for Hughes, is that there will be a full environmental impact study on both Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy. The study will follow the guidelines established by the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, which involves full public consultation, full industry consultation and its being a transparent process. The honourable member for Hughes is concerned to ensure that residents of her electorate will have their views considered in this process. I assure the honourable member for Hughes that that will be the case: their views will be considered and given great weight in the process of determining the environmental impact study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make it quite clear that all of those views of people in that area who will be affected, not only at Holsworthy but also at Badgerys Creek, will be considered because this government is not going to engage in a process that the previous Labor government engaged in when they did an environmental impact study for the third runway for Sydney's Mascot airport. That environmental impact study did not follow guidelines such as those put forward by the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise. It was not a transparent process. As a consequence of that, the people of north Sydney and the people of Sydney in general felt that the previous Labor government cheated and deceived them over the way the third runway was developed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure the honourable member for Hughes and her constituents that, firstly, Badgerys Creek is our preferred site and, secondly, the EIS process that will be undertaken will take full account of the concerns of her constituents and other constituents of members throughout the Sydney region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Australia. Major areas have had clearance or hazard reduction of recent times, since 1983. One of those was at Moorebank, in the electorate of Hughes. One of them was the Bogan Gate ammunition depot in Parkes. There was one at Yarrabandi in Parkes; another one at Paterson; and another one at Newington ammunition depot in Reid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Queensland, where you come from, there were assessments at Strathpine, Dickson and Tamborine. There was another one at Yanchep, as you know. The Leader of the Opposition ought to know that. In his perennial quest for a safe seat, he obviously ignored the fact that Port Kennedy in the seat of Brand, where there is a large housing development, and at Golden Harbour and Secret Harbour, where there are large housing developments, were all the Warnbro firing range&mdash;every one of those places. You moved into there. So obviously it is safe to clear up unexploded ordnance. But it is not a politically safe seat, as you found out in the recent past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that all over Europe, in Australia and in all sorts of places around the world this has been cleaned up.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen those reports. They come from the International Institute for Management and Development. In the latest report, released on 27 May 1996, Australia was ranked 21st out of 46 countries surveyed. Last year Australia was ranked 16th. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition would say, of course, that it is not in Australia's interest to have its economy talked down. But let me tell you what is in Australia's interests: to fix the problem and to undo the damage caused by 13 years of sloth under Labor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to that competitiveness report, as the Prime Minister has said, Australia ranked 42nd on hiring and firing practices and 46th on international telephone costs. As if it is not enough for Labor to have run Australia down in international competitiveness, the dead hand of Labor reaches out of the grave, even now, to stop the privatisation of Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to international developments, you would be aware, Mr Speaker, that Britain, New Zealand and the United States can all operate privatised telephone companies. The Germans can do it; Italy and Japan can move towards it. Latvia, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mexico and The Netherlands are all  moving towards privatisation in relation to Telecom.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to the tone of the shadow minister's question, this is a choice that we make for people. This is an opportunity that we provide for people which may not otherwise be available to them. The reason people would take up that choice is that it gives them a chance of earning higher pay&mdash;something also quite foreign to the other side in the last 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is based on the Victorian system. The question relates to the interface between the Commonwealth and the state jurisdictions. This is not a new issue. I have before me an extract from a federal award handed down by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in August 1994. It includes the following flexibility arrangement and is a clause of this award:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employees bound by this award may, at any time, enter into an individual or collective employment agreement under the Employee Relations Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Victorian act. In other words, this is a decision of the federal commission endorsing federally covered award employees entering into a collective employment agreement, or an individual one, under the Victorian legislation of 1992. The fact that we have an interface between state and federal is nothing new.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To answer another aspect of this question, it is a fact that there are different minima between state and federal awards, and it works both ways. The fact is that you can go from the state to the federal system and face lesser conditions in the federal system than under the state. It is always a surprise to the opposition, but the fact is that we have done exactly what we said we would do. It does provide people with a greater choice. One of the reasons they would exercise that choice is that the rates of pay and the increases in the rates of pay in recent years in the states of Western Australia and Victoria have outstripped many other states. Those systems have provided people with the chance of earning more pay, and earning more pay is one of our central objectives.</PARA>

The fact is that in this legislation we have provided very severe penalties for employers attempting to coerce their employees. In fact, Mr Speaker, we have gone further than simply providing penalties. I should add in respect of penalties that we have actually increased the penalties because the existing penalties were inadequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, in respect of training arrangements and young people generally, particularly by the retention of the junior wage rates, we are actually giving young people the chance of a job which you were about to deny them. If you look at what was proposed to happen under Labor as it impacted on the retail industry, the fact of the matter is that we were looking at a prospect of a couple of hundred thousand young people losing their jobs as a result of Labor's changes already included in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one last thing I want to say in respect of the principle of paying young people who are undertaking training. I was very pleased that the shadow minister, when asked this question on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last week, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're not arguing that people should necessarily be paid because they're off work at TAFE.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .. this desirable objective, which we share, of ensuring that there's training available and that employers don't have to pay people for not working.</PARA>
<PARA>So he has accepted the basic principle. I was not surprised at that because this is not a new principle. If you look at the career start training award, which employed this very principle, the previous Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said on 27 July 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is not offering a single, simplistic solution such as a cut to youth wage rates.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the argument you are now running. So he obviously did not regard what we are now proposing as a youth wage. He went on to explain that wages would be based on hourly award rates for time spent on the job. That is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exactly the principle underlying the modern Australian apprenticeship training scheme which we are proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the ACTU have some form on this very point. They themselves, in a submission to the Industrial Relations Commission on the national training award, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not a simplistic or Jobsback type approach. The proposal is consistent with the level of award pay that would ordinarily apply for the skill level sought to be achieved on a non-training hours pro rata basis.</PARA>
<PARA>In answer to the question, the fact is that the Labor opposition are running a scare campaign based on a proposition in our legislation which is designed to give young people a chance at training when they themselves and their running mates in the ACTU have publicly supported the principle behind this. They must know this provides young people a chance at training denied them under the existing, very rigid, system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very pleased to have this proposal in the legislative package.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question. We heard just a few moments ago the Treasurer talking about Labor doing special deals for their special mates, special privileges for their special mates. The track record of Labor in government when it comes to their very special mate, the Maritime Union of Australia, goes unsurpassed in the history of Australian government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1502"> From 1989 through to March this year an unbelievable amount of money was directed by the previous Labor government at the maritime unions in order to achieve so-called reforms and benefits for the Australian peo ple. Chief amongst those was the so-called waterfront reform program that cost us as Australians $450 million. What did the people of Australia get for their $450 million? Did we get a waterfront that made Australia's waterfront internationally competitive? No, we did not. We ended up with a waterfront that still performs at levels as low as 14 container movements per hour, which is the same level of container movements per hour that was being achieved before waterfront reform was started back in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can look at the waterfront reforms in other nations. You can look, for example, at some of the bigger volume ports around the world and you will see them moving containers at the rate of 40 and 50 per hour compared with Australia's range of 14 to a high of 19 per hour. Our neighbour New Zealand went through waterfront reform and they regularly achieve waterfront performance figures that go as high as 30&hyphen;odd containers per hour. They did not have to fork out $450 million in order to achieve those reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go from there to the shipping industry, you realise that this government paid out $320 million of your money and mine allegedly to create an internationally competitive Australian shipping industry. Let us compare it with the facts. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics last year highlighted the fact that, despite the $320 million and the years of talking about reform, we ended up with an Australian shipping fleet which on average costs $2 million per year more per ship than similar shipping fleets in OECD nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Did we achieve any value for our money? No, we did not. As part of that $320 million, there was a special, you&hyphen;beaut deal for the Maritime Union of Australia which saw the taxpayers of Australia paying in the form of a grant the PAYE tax for international seafarers&mdash;some $20 million&mdash;a one-off deal struck in September 1994 to resolve a dispute over the sale of ANL which the government was so hopelessly involved in. Some $20 million a year was allocated to that on the condition that improvements were delivered by the Maritime Union of Australia, improve ments such as a reduction in the crew to berth ratio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did we have at the end of the first 12 months of forking out our $20 million? Did we have a reduction in crew to berth ratios? No, we did not. They actually went up, so our money was wasted there as well. Then we had a you&hyphen;beaut deal for our special mates in the Maritime Union that was called the Ships (Capital Grants) Act. It was designed to help subsidise the cost of ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where did the money go? Eighty per cent of the money that was allocated by the Australian taxpayer went to subsidise the cost of building ships in other countries, such as Japan, Korea and Poland. Eighty per cent of that money has gone to subsidise those shipbuilding jobs in those countries. Then $180 million went into the losses of ANL as a consequence of this government's failure to adequately manage the sale of ANL. That is $180 million worth of extra losses that the taxpayers of Australia would not have incurred if the previous government could manage a shipping company like ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this all amount to? It amounts to nearly $1,000 million spent by this government on behalf of Australians to allegedly achieve a more competitive Australian maritime industry. The people of Australia can judge just who got the benefit of the deal. Was it the taxpayers of Australia and the people who sought a job by having a more competitive maritime industry in this country? No, it was not. It was the people in the Maritime Union whom you support so much. From that example people can see that when it comes to special deals and special privileges nobody does it better than the Labor Party.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the minister aware of rumours that the Mayor of Taipei City has been refused entry into Australia to attend a conference of mayors from around the Asia-Pacific region which is being hosted <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by Brisbane's Lord Mayor Jim Soorley later this year? Minister, whilst I acknowledge that there are some diplomatic difficulties surrounding Taiwan, why should these difficulties extend to this particular level of government? Further, I ask you to verify if the rumoured visa refusal is true and, if so, will you reconsider this matter urgently?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1503" SPEAKER="Downer, Alexander, MP" NAMEID="4G4" ELECTORATE="Mayo" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Foreign Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. It is true that the Brisbane City Council is organising in late September or early October a conference of Asia-Pacific city mayors. They have issued invitations, as I understand it, to the mayors of quite a number of cities, including cities in the People's Republic of China. There is now some discussion about whether the Mayor of Taipei should attend this conference as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some from the Brisbane City Council are suggesting that the Australian government would stand in the way of a visit to this conference by the Mayor of Taipei. Indeed, a rumour has been circulating in the last couple of days that the Australian government has refused, as the member said in his question, to issue a visa to the Mayor of Taipei. The fact is that the rumour about the visa is totally false. There has been no decision to refuse the Mayor of Taipei entry into Australia, and the government has not even received a request for a visa from the Mayor of Taipei. Naturally enough, the federal government would facilitate visa issue for people attending international conferences of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I want the House to be perfectly clear&mdash;and, for that matter, I want the Lord Mayor of Brisbane to be particularly clear on this&mdash;that, as far as the federal government is concerned, the Mayor of Taipei can go to the conference of Asia-Pacific mayors in Brisbane. We are perfectly happy to see the Mayor of Taipei go. This is not an official government conference: this is a local government conference, not a national government conference. So we are very happy to have the Mayor of Taipei go to this conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Lord Mayor of Brisbane is for some reason unhappy about the Mayor of Taipei attending the conference, that is a matter that the Lord Mayor of Brisbane should come clean on. I am not sure what his view is. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1504"> What surprises me is the way that I get these messages out of Brisbane that somehow the federal government is standing in the way of a visit by the Mayor of Taipei.

Honourable members on this side will know that during the election the government committed itself to implementing a more transparent wholesale pricing formula. With that transparency will come accountability. At the moment, the system is entirely complex; it is as clear as mud. I venture to suggest that there are a number of parties in the petroleum industry who have a vested interest in keeping it that way. But the government is determined to lift the veil of secrecy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major reform is to ensure access to oil terminals, presently restricted because of the Laidley agreement, which, members would know, dates from 1980 when an agreement was entered into between the Transport Workers Union and the petrol distributors association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fascinatingly, during the election not a single Labor member, to the best of my knowledge, opposed the Laidley agreement, which restricts competition at the wholesale point. So is there anybody now who opposes the Laidley agreement? Of course there is not. It is a closed shop; independents cannot access oil terminals as freely as they could without the Laidley agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government inherited an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry into the petroleum industry. It will report to the government on 31 July. It is looking at a whole number of measures which will assist the government in implementing its policy. In fact, the Treasurer wrote to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1505"> chairman of the ACCC, Professor Fels, in April advising that the inquiry should pay particular attention to country petrol pricing and terminal gate pricing and asking whether these proposals are likely to meet the objective of lowering country fuel prices, enhanced transparency and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once that report is received on 31 July, the government will move quickly. I, together with my colleagues in the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, the portfolio minister, Mr Moore, and the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, will meet with our state colleagues because we want a uniform, national approach.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. How will the residents of Sydney living under the flight corridor to the north of Sydney airport benefit as a result of proposed new take-off arrangements at Kingsford Smith airport? Can the minister give a commitment that there will be substantial relief from aircraft noise for the northern Sydney residents suffering the effects of the insidious and unfair Labor Party flight paths known as the Bennelong funnel?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1509" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. He has been very active in this issue and has been a leader in expressing the concerns of people in regard to the very unfair flight paths that were generated by the previous government when they opened the third runway, which saw a relentless passage of aircraft traffic over the heads of people that lived under what has become commonly known as the Bennelong funnel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing I need to say about this is that the government when in opposition made some very specific promises in regard to managing aircraft noise problems in Sydney. We, for example, said that within 10 working days of being sworn into office we would give a direction to Airservices Australia to reopen the east-west runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as the Prime Minister pointed out in his previous answer, this government takes its commitments, promises it made in opposition, very seriously indeed. If there is an example that anyone can give of this government living up to its promises quickly, openly and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1510"> honestly, it is in our commitment to reopen the east-west runway within 10 working days of being sworn into office. In fact, we did it within eight working days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following that, on 28 March, I gave an instruction to Airservices Australia to effectively abolish the inequitable mandatory flight corridors to the north of Sydney airport known as the Bennelong funnel. Following that, there has been an increasing usage of the east&hyphen;west runway since I gave the direction to reopen it within 10 working days of our being sworn into office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the important initiatives outlined at a public meeting held in the Prime Minister's electorate of Bennelong last Thursday evening, which will further assist those people who have been suffering the inequitable Labor Party flight corridors to the north of Sydney airport, is a decision which will see commencement on 15 June. It is a change to the operating pattern of Sydney's Mascot airport allowing take-offs to the west on the east&hyphen;west runway whilst, at the same time, maximising the opportunity to move aircraft over Botany Bay&mdash;over water&mdash;and having landings from the south on the parallel runways at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that meeting in Hunters Hill last Thursday evening, I also announced that I had issued a direction to Airservices Australia to review, by 31 August this year, the runway operations on the new third runway&mdash;runway 34R, as you see it coming from Botany Bay&mdash;to reverse the traffic flow on that runway and possibly enable aircraft to take off to the north of that runway, making an immediate turn to the right and taking up the flight paths that are in existence now for the east&hyphen;west flight paths, flying over the golf links and the cemetery out to the ocean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those two initiatives alone, coupled with our initiative and commitment to reopen the east&hyphen;west runway, will see a major reduction in the noise levels being experienced by people living to the north of Sydney's Mascot airport under the Bennelong funnel. In addition to that, I have also instructed Airservices Australia to conduct a full review of the flight paths for Sydney and that review will be completed by 16 December this year. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> review will incorporate possible use of military controlled airspace to design a flight path system for Sydney's airport that enhances flights over water and non&hyphen;built&hyphen;up areas. All these commitments ensure that we live up to the promise, given by the Prime Minister when he was Leader of the Opposition, that we will see a more equitable distribution of the aircraft noise problem over Sydney. We have lived up to that commitment to the letter so far and we will pursue it further.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I have reflected on this question and I might add that on 27 May <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the honourable member for Werriwa asked me a number of questions alleging plagiarism in a member's contribution to the debate on the supply bills. The member asked whether plagiarism is an acceptable practice in this House. My observation over a number of years has been that members frequently acknowledge in debate assistance they have received in preparing their material. Where members may not know the specific sources of the material they use, it is not uncommon for general acknowledgment to be given, for example, extending thanks to the staff of the Parliamentary Research Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member also asked whether I would recommend a standing order dealing with such a practice. I believe it would be impossible for any occupant of the chair to monitor the breadth of members' contributions in debate compared with the vast expanse of human learning. Even where the chair felt that a member may not be acknowledging all sources of inspiration of his or her thoughts, I am not sure that it would be appropriate for the chair to bring a member to order for not doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not convinced that, in a chamber striving for lively interchange of debate, a member's contribution should be footnoted by numerous citations. Where a member feels that there may have been an absence of acknowledgment of sources, the member may decide to bring the matter to the attention of the House and presumably the House will form its own judgment. Should this issue continue to cause concern to members, the House could consider referring the matter to the Procedure Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I do not feel that I can comment on questions of royalty payments and copyright, other than to say that the privilege of freedom of speech means that members are absolutely privileged from suit or prosecution in respect of anything that they might say in the course of the proceedings of this parliament.</PARA></ANSWER>

He would be removed from the books of any Australian university for being a plagiarist. If he were a journalist, he would be breaching the ethics of the Australian journalists association to produce true and reliable information at all times. I could not think of a worse practice.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appalling for the member for Cowan to come into this place and to lift word for word the speech of an American citizen and then try to explain it away by saying that he often makes speeches on behalf of his constituents in Cowan. I have looked up the electoral roll for the seat of Cowan; there is no Peter F. Drucker listed on the electoral roll for the division of Cowan. So the member was not making a speech on behalf of constituents. He was doing nothing more than plagiarising an article which was given to him by the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) some 18 months ago. It is an appalling practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, this is a complete breach of the representative basis of our democracy. If the people of Cowan want to be represented in this place by the words of Peter F Drucker, they should vote for him. But at this stage the gentleman from the United States has not run for that seat. I am suggesting that the Labor Party might want to consider recruiting Peter F. Drucker on the slogan `The real thing'. It would be the real thing for Cowan instead of the imitation thing, instead of the plagiarised thing, that the member has presented to this House. It is a shabby practice and it should not be tolerated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even worse, we have all been slurred with the accusation of plagiarism. The member for Cowan went to the newspapers last night. In an article by the ever&hyphen;reliable Mike Seccombe in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, the member for Cowan said that everybody does it. That is what the member for Cowan has said about plagiarism&mdash;everyone does it, from the Prime Minister to the minister for health.</PARA>

All those decent honourable members&mdash;most of them on this side of the House&mdash;who do a lot of research, a lot of work, a lot of hard thinking about their parliamentary speeches have been slurred by the member for Cowan in this morning's press where he says that everybody in this House of Representatives does it.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have never done it. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It would be foreign to every instinct in my body to walk into this House and give a speech on behalf of the people of Werriwa that I had lifted from someone else's ideas. I would be ashamed of that practice and would immediately apologise to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cowan spoke on the adjournment debate last night. He did not even have the decency to apologise to the people of his electorate, who believed that he made this speech. He would not apologise to his own party colleagues, who would have been sitting here in the House listening to those words, believing they were his. He refused to apologise to the moral standards and decency of the supreme parliament of this land. He refused to apologise for something that was plainly indecent. According to my motion before the House, he should apologise now for this terrible slur on our reputation. He should apologise to each and every member who has been reflected on by the comments that are in the morning press. Most importantly, we should refer this issue to the Procedure Committee so that it never happens again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the direction and suggestion of the Speaker that this should go on to the Procedure Committee for its consideration. What better service could they give this parliament than to make sure that it never happens again. It is making a laughing stock of the standards of this parliament. It is all over the country on talkback radio. This is happening at a time when the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong, supported by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), who is at the table, have said that they would lift the standard of debate. You don't lift the standard of debate by plagiarising and by doing what this man has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cowan stands condemned by this House, as do his leader and his party colleagues, for lowering the standards of this House. Yesterday afternoon they had an opportunity to go to the member for Cowan and say, `You've been caught. Maybe you meant no harm by this, but the parliament is supreme. You have done the wrong thing in the national parliament; go in and apologise. Say that it is an unacceptable standard and it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1514"> will never happen again.' They refused to do those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister refused to show leadership and take in hand the member for Cowan and say, `You've been caught. Own up to it, apologise and then go hide under a rock for a few months.' He refused to do those things. The shameless member for Cowan is in the morning press saying that we are all guilty of this practice and we are all slurred by the accusation of plagiarism. It is untrue. He should have more respect for the parliament than to lift Peter Drucker's words straight out of the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Atlantic Monthly</EMPHASIS>. He should have more respect for this Parliament than to try to slur us all with his own inadequacies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the member for Cowan could not think of anything original to say or come up with any original Liberal Party contribution on the very important supply bills that were before this House last Thursday is a shameful thing. Worst of all, the member for Cowan is totally shameless about this. Listening to him on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM </EMPHASIS>program last night and from reading the papers this morning it was as if he had done nothing wrong. This is but a mere hiccup in his glorious parliamentary career as he moves towards the front bench.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of standard is the Liberal Party setting for all those new members to say, `If you want to, look up the speeches of Aristotle, Plato, John Stuart Mill or any other philosopher or anyone who has a view and read them out word for word, sentence for sentence, in the House of Representatives?' That is their definition of an acceptable parliamentary standard. That is their commitment to the Australian people that this House would have a decent standard of debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could not imagine a lower standard of debate. I could not imagine that in the 95 years since the House of Representatives was formed that there was a lower occasion on which a member blatantly plagiarised the words of an American citizen and pretended to this House that they were his words. He stands condemned. We should disassociate this House from the comments he made in the press this morning. Most importantly, we should make sure that this never happens <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> again. Never again should a member of the House of Representatives be allowed to plagiarise from published material. This material was on the record all over the world. Academic institutions and universities all know the work of Peter F. Drucker. The member for Cowan tried to pretend to this House that they were his ideas. He demonstrates the intellectual bankruptcy of the Liberal Party in the 1990s. He represents their deceit. He represents the way in which this government is determined to make a mockery of any decent parliamentary standard by which we conduct debate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I remind members on the opposite side that if sending such remarks to a committee were to become commonplace then we would have a lot of issues going off to committees. Take, for example, the Kirribilli deal&mdash;it finally was brought to the attention of the House. If this is the new standard that the other side want to adopt, then that issue would have gone off to a committee. If ever there was a secret deal that could have been subject to committee deliberations, then the Kirribilli is it.</PARA>

In the 1990 election, they were full of public claims that no deal had been made.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go back a bit further, because some of the things that have been said on the other side stick in my mind. I remember that one of the statements made was that there would be no capital gains tax. That was a promise, a public statement, a public declaration.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members opposite are interjecting about indirect tax reform. If this is the new standard to be adopted, then we ought to have a committee which would examine the commitments made prior to the 1993 election by the previous government about indirect taxes. You might remember that in that election the then government claimed that if people voted for the coalition parties they would get a GST but that if you voted for the then Labor government you would not. Of course, after the election and in the following budget, they introduced a series of increases in indirect taxes. This meant that the average family was paying more indirect tax than it would have been if the then coalition government had been elected and introduced a GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely incredible that the members opposite should start talking to us about parliamentary standards and general standards of behaviour when it comes to telling the truth to the Australian people. There is no doubt that one of the reasons there are 49 members on that side of the House and 94 members on the government benches is that the Australian people judged the previous government on its capacity to tell the Australian public the truth, and the Australian public found them wanting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the parliamentary standard, the general conduct and behaviour, of the other side was one of the factors which led to the massive collapse in the Labor Party's vote in the last election. An allied aspect that people voted as they did in the 2 March election is that the previous government let <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1516"> standards in this parliament fall to an all&hyphen;time low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No more apparent than that fall in standards was the language of former Prime Minister Keating. He lowered standards in such a way that it became a common reflection by members of the public during the last election campaign that they would not even bring their children in to listen to question time because of the low standards and the poor language of the previous Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say, if I were not a person of such generous disposition, that having the opposition talk to us about parliamentary standards does rather rankle.

<PARA>colleague, in this House. Not one word did he say in defence of him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Guilt of plagiarism has been acknowledged by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). The poaching of another writer's words is referred to by the Australian National University in its undergraduate rules in relation to misconduct in examinations: `Misconduct including cheating, plagiarism, reproducing in or submitting for assessment or any examination the work of another person whether wholly or in part and whether with or without the knowledge or consent of that other person.' In all of my experience, this is the shabbiest and seediest performance by a Leader of the House on an issue as vitally important as this that I have seen. This goes to the very fundamentals of the conduct of this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the Speaker who this afternoon led us and the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) to pursue this motion. It did not arise as a result of the actions of the opposition. The motion was given a lead by the Speaker looking to the conduct of the House. The Leader of the House has just made an utter mockery of the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this chamber on 30 April:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is part of our system of government that the executive is controlled by parliament and parliament controlled by the law and the customs and conventions of our society. I think it is important that steps are made on both sides of the parliament to reassert and re&hyphen;establish a degree of respect and regard for the institution.</PARA>
<PARA>Here, just a few moments ago, was the opportunity for the Leader of the House to do just that. But he has rebutted that, and he has turned the words of the Prime Minister on their head&mdash;an absolute disgrace to the conduct of this parliament. It augurs ill for the parliament in the remainder of its term. But this practice is not new to the Liberal Party. I want honourable members to cast their minds back to 1992 when another member of the opposition&mdash;a Liberal Party member of the opposition&mdash;released a document relating to the GST which was a direct lift from a document of the government of New Zealand. That document only had the address changed on it and the signature. Who did that? Who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1517"> was it? It was the honourable member opposite&mdash;the Leader of the House. He should come clean on this. He cannot defend the honourable member on the other side, because he is a party to it. We were all thinking that this was just the honourable member for Cowan having made a mistake, in that he found an article that he liked and read it out thinking it was pretty important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cowan has absolutely trivialised the parliament, he has debased the parliament, but the real issue behind it, and what makes this issue serious now, is the conduct of the Leader of the House. He has not defended the action&mdash;in fact, he has endorsed it. He said, `It's hardly appropriate to send it off to a committee. Really, it is a matter of the member for Werriwa pursuing the honourable member for Cowan.' What a mockery! The reality is that the Liberal Party has forgotten nothing. It does not learn much, but what it learns it never forgets&mdash;and it is the same old practice we saw with the GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conduct of the honourable member for Cowan debases everyone in this parliament. We on this side of the House utterly reject and condemn the conduct of the honourable member. When I look at his entry in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Handbook</EMPHASIS>, I see that he is a Fellow of the Company Directors Institute, a business consultant, a political commentator&mdash;that fits&mdash;and a public speaker. That also fits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to take back to the Speaker the issue we raise concerning the standing orders. There are standing orders governing relevancy; there ought to be standing orders governing accuracy. We ask from this side of the House, in seeking support for this motion for the reference to the Procedure Committee, that you use your good offices, along with the Speaker, and follow the lead of the Speaker to send this matter off to the Procedure Committee where it will be properly dealt with. It will then come back with a recommendation for a standing order to be drawn up to protect the members of this House and the public of Australia by ensuring that what is delivered here is properly acknowledged. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Today celebrates the 35th anniversary of Amnesty International and the vital role it plays in striving for the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide and the contribution made to the global human rights debate. Amnesty's origins began in 1961 when a British lawyer named Peter Benenson, reading his morning newspaper, learned that two Portuguese students had been arrested for drinking a toast to freedom in a Lisbon cafe. For that simple, peaceful act they were sentenced to seven years in jail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Outraged, a one&hyphen;year campaign was started to help people imprisoned for their beliefs. Benenson's newspaper appeal, an article called `The forgotten prisoners', was published worldwide on 28 May 1961. He urged people everywhere to work impartially and peacefully for the release of `prisoners of conscience'. That appeal brought in more than 1,000 offers of support for the idea of an international campaign to protect human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within six weeks an international movement was formed. Within 12 months the new organisation had sent delegations to four countries to make representations on behalf of prisoners and had taken up 210 cases. Amnesty International had organised national bodies in seven countries. The first year's expenditure was &pound;6,040.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, Amnesty International is a worldwide movement of people. It has more than one million members, subscribers and regular donors in over 170 countries and territories and over 4,300 Amnesty International volunteer groups. There are nationally organised sections in 55 countries, 35 of them in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and Central Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The organisation's nerve centre, the International Secretariat in London, has over 320 paid staff and 90 volunteers from more than 50 countries. From a few delegations to four <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1519"> countries in 1961 there were nearly 80 delegations to approximately 75 countries in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, there are approximately 25,000 members and supporters. It boasts one of the few parliamentary groups in the world where members of all political parties and Independents are members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Amnesty International parliamentary group has established over the years a close relationship with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The group forwards to the department all of Amnesty International's urgent action cases, and our overseas missions take up all of these with relevant governments&mdash;amounting to approximately 500 cases a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Amnesty International parliamentary group is holding its first meeting of the year this Thursday at lunchtime to inform new senators, members and their staff of the work of the group and to develop its program for the coming year. It is an encouraging sign for the promotion of human rights that so many new MPs have not only joined the group but have expressed an interest in becoming involved in its work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amnesty International boasts professional networks across the medical profession, legal sector, trade union movement and educational, women's and religious institutions. There are 151 local groups of volunteers in Australia and thousands of other activists who campaign regularly on behalf of victims of human rights violations who are threatened with imprisonment, unfair trials, torture or execution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plight of prisoners of conscience and changes in government practice have since led Amnesty International to confront other issues beyond its original mandate. In addition to working on behalf of prisoners of conscience&mdash;people imprisoned for their beliefs or identity who have not used nor advocated violence&mdash;Amnesty International now campaigns for fair trials for political prisoners and to end torture, `disappearances', political killings and executions. It works to promote human rights in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Throughout the world, Amnesty International's members campaign for truth and jus tice. Amnesty International's annual global report which details violations against men, women and children in all regions of the world has become well known as a standard reference for a global overview of political imprisonment, torture and executions around the world. The unfortunate reality is that, even after 35 years of Amnesty International's campaigning and documenting of human rights abuses, there are millions of people who continue to be subjected to serious human rights violations in all corners of the globe. There is still much work to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia will continue its commitment to the fundamental importance of human rights in the pursuit of freedom and dignity for all peoples. This is reflected not only in the work of the Australian parliamentary group but also in the support received from many Australians in their private capacity. As a long-time supporter of Amnesty International and member of the Australian parliamentary group, I reaffirm the importance of the work of Amnesty in campaigning for the universality and indivisibility of human rights.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It is with pleasure that I respond to the statement by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of Amnesty International. As all honourable members are aware, Amnesty International has played and continues to play an extraordinary and vital role in working for the protection and the promotion of human rights all around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From modest beginnings in 1961, Amnesty International has gone from strength to strength to become today a worldwide movement with more than a million committed members, subscribers and regular donors in over 170 countries and territories. As the honourable member for Berowra has pointed out, there are some 25,000 Amnesty members and supporters in Australia. The Amnesty parliamentary group in this parliament is one of the few such groups in the world in which members of all political parties, as well as the Independents, participate. Support in this parliament for a strong human rights stand by our nation abroad and at home is, of course, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1520"> bipartisan and broadly based in the Australian community. Our nation has a proud tradition of support for human rights as an integral and essential element of our engagement in the wider world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1945, great Australian jurist and statesman Herbert Vere Evatt played a leading role in the negotiation of the United Nations charter. The preamble, in simple but eloquent language, sets out the determination of the peoples of the world `to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in equal rights of men and women'. Three years later, as President of the United Nations General Assembly, Evatt also played a key role in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the half century since the 1940s, the nations and peoples of the world have gone on to develop an increasingly effective system of principles, legal regimes and machinery to promote human rights and to protect groups and individuals from injustice. In 1996, human rights are recognised as an integral part of national and international activity. International scrutiny of a country's human rights performance is generally regarded as legitimate in a way that was only dimly perceived when the universal declaration was adopted back in 1948.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, world attention and activity on human rights is on a scale scarcely imaginable five decades ago. Much of this fundamental shift in values and attitudes is directly attributable to the tireless work of Amnesty International members, whether working on behalf of individual prisoners of conscience or promoting acceptance of the universality of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we are also consistently reminded, of course, of just how much needs to be done. Recent events in Burma are but the latest reminder of the need for Australia to continue to work unremittingly in support of the universality and the indivisibility of human rights. As the honourable member for Berowra has said, there is still much work to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work of the Australian Amnesty parliamentary group is to be commended and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> supported, as is the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, especially that of our diplomats in making inquiries and representations on human rights cases in often difficult circumstances overseas. Working for human rights is something that requires hard work, persistence and resources. Today I would urge all members of this House, government and opposition, to give strong support, in word and deed, to the work of Amnesty International.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week in addressing the housing legislation I was praising Brian Howe as one of the innovative social policy thinkers in Australia and outlining the three principles that he has introduced to the latest round of the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement, including horizontal equity and a sophisticated division of responsibility between federal and state government roles in public housing. The third principle relates to the idea of mobility and flexibility on social policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of the interesting aspects of our internationalised economy that the movement of investment and the relocation of employment is happening at a faster rate than changes in urban form. It thereby stands to reason that governments need to examine greater mobility and flexibility in social policy so that they can use those instruments of government to match the fast changing nature of investment patterns and the location of employment. It is clear that this has had a profound impact on the nature of public housing stock and the opportunities available to public housing tenants in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, in the 1960s, in the sort of estate in which I grew up&mdash;Green Valley in Sydney&mdash;80 per cent of the households had someone in work. Today in public housing estates in my electorate, that figure has reduced to 20 per cent. There has been a change from blue&hyphen;collar, working&hyphen;class public housing to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what is essentially, in the 1990s, welfare housing. It reflects the loss of tariff protected manufacturing work on the urban fringe and the whole change in social composition for public housing tenants. This is something the government needs to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted that the former member for Batman, Brian Howe, was examining the possibility of lease&hyphen;back and head leasing arrangements to provide mobility so that urban form could be matched against changes in investment. For instance, if people in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney do not have available employment opportunities to suit their labour force skills, head leasing and lease&hyphen;back arrangements by the New South Wales Department of Housing could be used to move them much closer to those particular employment opportunities. That flexibility is very important with our ageing population. Some of the housing stock is no longer suited to parents whose children have grown up and left home. Such people might have retired and probably need to move much closer to transport nodes and social amenities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This idea of lease&hyphen;back and head leasing in the latest round of the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement is a major breakthrough in the way in which we treat public housing in Australia. I believe it has a whole range of potential applications across other social policy areas. It is one of the defining issues for Australian politics in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People ask what the difference is between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party on some of these key issues. On the issue of place, of course, the Liberal Party cares little where people live. By and large, members opposite would be happy about the suburbs in which they live. But they do not care too much about issues of location and place, issues of locational advantage and disadvantage. On the Labor Party side of politics it is an article of faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe passionately that place and location influence social morale, identity, social opportunity and lifestyle expectations. We think that place matters. That is why the former government was moving forward with these very important changes to the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1525">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am disappointed that in my own seat of Werriwa, the former government's plan for better cities&mdash;redevelopment of the public housing estates&mdash;has been abandoned by this new government. It has been cut away by the newly elected member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey) in his capacity as the Minister for Finance. I could not think of anything worse than to know the benefits that that better cities program would have brought to the reformulation of the housing stock&mdash;the rejuvenation of employment and social opportunities for those public housing tenants in Campbelltown&mdash;and to understand that the Minister for Finance has announced that the program will end; it will not proceed. Major social and economic reform that would be of lasting benefit to the south&hyphen;west of Sydney has been abandoned under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plans were not just to reformulate the housing stock, to redevelop the housing estates&mdash;much as the Defence Housing Authority has done in recent years&mdash;but also to examine some interesting trials for the reformulation of service delivery. The term that I use is `place management', a term that I would recommend to the House. I hope we hear more about it in coming years. Place management argues that there is a sound reason for rethinking from first principles the relationship between state services and disadvantaged people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the days of Captain Phillip, state government functions have structured themselves around professional groupings or guilds. Doctors run our hospitals, teachers run our schools, engineers control the RTA in New South Wales, town planners run urban affairs and so on. Each department then puts together some special programs, ostensibly to assist the disadvantaged. In each part of the state, public services are basically run the same way, no matter how different each location may be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for disadvantaged people and suburbs, their problems do not easily fall into each segment of government. A poor education, unemployment, homelessness, drug reliance, domestic violence and other social problems often overlap with and reinforce each other. Instead of managing people or places out of difficulty, governments, by and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> large, manage an uncoordinated set of social and economic functions. These methods can no longer cope with the local impact of globalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the emergence of a skills based economy, the wealth of nations is now primarily a function of the skills and capacity of its citizens. So too for local areas and regions where the signs of economic and social success rely heavily on the skills and insights of residents. This link, however, flows two ways: skills determine the socioeconomic features of places, but so too do these features influence skill formation. Research by Bob Gregory and Boyd Hunter at the ANU&mdash;I am always happy to cite their work&mdash;has shown that, once personal characteristics are factored out of each census collector district, a significant residual remains in high unemployment areas, which can only be explained in terms of an underclass cycle of locational disadvantage. To be certain, place matters. The member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Postcodes determine lifestyles and life chances, far more than technology: identify someone's postcode and a fair estimate can be made of his or her educational background and prospects for satisfying work.</PARA>
<PARA>The link between postcodes and life chances is a little more complex. Increasingly, material benefits and lifestyles are being determined by a person's contribution to internationally exposed production processes. High incomes bring with them access to high cost housing areas and also a high propensity for outsourcing household consumption. In this fashion, high school locations enjoy a virtuous cycle of high income, high consumption and high employment. By contrast, low skill areas are locked into a cycle of low consumption and low employment. Successful individuals usually move out of these areas while poorly skilled residents move in, producing an urban churning effect, which is a real feature of our public housing estates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Areas such as central western Sydney and the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne face a double jeopardy: postcodes, people and skills with poor access to internationally competitive industries and employment and, consequently, low incomes, low spending power and inadequate employment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1526"> generation. For policy makers this represents a deficiency in aggregate demand, a crisis in skills formation and the necessity for new forms of government intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Working Nation program, for instance, showed the way ahead with case management&mdash;that is, customising the services of the public sector around the unique needs and circumstances of each individual. One size no longer fits all. Just as much, the public sector needs to move into place management. The first step is to bundle together the public resources&mdash;in health, housing, education, training and community services&mdash;of a selected suburb or local government area. These could then be managed by a new authority empowered to buy in&mdash;from both publicly and privately owned providers&mdash;the services best suited to meeting local needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This structure would replicate the funder/purchaser/provider split which has worked effectively in other aspects of public sector reform. It emphasises outcomes rather than self-serving and segmented administrative inputs. It fosters flexibility by directing the public sector at results rather than simply complying with the departmental handbook. It demands performance and the satisfaction of client needs for the ongoing allocation of public resources. It abolishes the guilds and relies on multidisciplinary management teams and substantial community input, a real prerequisite for empowering disadvantaged people. It looks to demand rather than supply&hyphen;side solutions in social policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of place management come from restructuring the public sector around our most serious social problems. It has the flexibility to create cross-sectoral solutions. There are, for instance, great gains to be made in education from linking the home and school learning environment. The equity in place management comes from targeting and redistributing resources on the basis of locational need. It also fosters a whole of government approach to the case management of disadvantaged citizens. This represents a significant strengthening of the social contract: the ideal that governments are obliged to help those in need but, just as much, citizens are obliged to make best use of this assistance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Place management does not require the state&hyphen;wide dismantling of departments. It can be trialled at locations of critical need. That is what I am advocating. This is what would have happened under the better cities program in Campbelltown, tragically abolished by the member for Macarthur. In suburbs with unemployment rates of 30 per cent and welfare dependency at 80 per cent&mdash;sadly, so typical of some of Sydney's public housing areas&mdash;very little can be lost by way of public policy outcomes. Broken programs require new methods. Chronic problems require radical solutions. So much of our politics these days is driven by the gap between global economic change and the uneven local impact of national competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recommend to the House place management as a means by which policy makers can close this gap. I recommend to the government that they reinstate the better cities program for Campbelltown as an outstanding trial by which place management could be placed on the national agenda as a really exciting social policy innovation. I have been working on this idea with local councillors in Campbelltown and with the state member for Moorebank, Craig Knowles, who is also the planning minister in the New South Wales government. It is a genuine innovation. It was supported in the former government by the Minister for Social Security, Peter Baldwin. Brian Howe supported it. It would have been a real breakthrough and a real experiment in Australia's great tradition of social laboratory reforms to make a difference locally as we grapple with solutions to globalisation. It is something that truly is innovative. I know because I have taken a little test here for the House that all these things will be pored over by the Liberal Party to check their origins. It is something that was coming out of the south-west of Sydney, a Labor Party idea, responding to those problems that we had so sadly identified in our local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish the government would reinstate this idea. My colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) has a great interest in urban policy. She is one of those in the parliament who will be making a contribution, saying that place management and good urban policy can make a difference in Australia. We on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1527"> this side of the House will always pursue these sorts of ideas. I trust that in the life of this parliament, particularly leading through to the next election, they are developed fully, understood and supported by the Australian people. They do make a difference.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Housing Assistance Bill continues the assistance provided by the Commonwealth to people to obtain access to housing that is affordable and appropriate to their needs. It recognises that, while housing and shelter are a basic human need, not all Australians are able to obtain housing which is appropriate to their needs and within their means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate for governments at both state and federal levels to provide such assistance, particularly to those who are disadvantaged either socially or economically. Such people would otherwise be at risk of homelessness and its subsequent effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, while the government has such an obligation, I have had brought to my attention cases of irresponsibility by certain tenants in receipt of government assistance. These are cases in which, notwithstanding the effects of homelessness, the government should not be obliged to provide assistance when the tenants have not upheld their end of the bargain by being reliable and faithful tenants. As such, the final alternative may be to advise such people that if they do not lift their game the government will not be there to hold their hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise that that might mean that such people are left high and dry, but that would be their choice and their choice alone. It does sound harsh, and I do not deny that. But, while every person has a right to appropriate shelter and housing, they also have the responsibility when they are provided with assistance for their shelter to respect, maintain and look after it. Unfortunately, I have landlords in my electorate who have shown goodwill and have provided rental accommodation to people only to see their asset literally destroyed. The same goes for housing provided by Homeswest, Western Australia's state housing commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preamble to the bill highlights the importance of encouraging private sector <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> involvement in the provision of appropriate and affordable housing. This is desirable as it provides a greater choice and flexibility. Also, so long as the states provide legislative protection against recalcitrant tenants, Homeswest has partaken in a number of joint ventures with private enterprise, which has been to the benefit of tenants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 4(1) of the bill provides that the objects of the bill are to provide financial assistance to the states and territories for the provision of housing assistance to people. Clause 4(3) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of the housing assistance provided for under this Act is to be achieved by:</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) ensuring that the rights of people receiving assistance are properly protected and that due regard is had to their responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>While I acknowledge that aspects of housing assistance responsibility fall within the jurisdiction of the states, more can be done at the federal level to protect those in the private rental market. Without the private rental market, the demands on government would be much greater, and it is therefore incumbent upon governments to ensure that, notwithstanding the needs and requirements of tenants, those involved in the provision of private rental accommodation are adequately provided for also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My reason for enunciating my concerns in this area is in view of problems brought to my attention by those providing rental accommodation. For example, one person had a tenant in their property who was in receipt of rental accommodation. The tenant chose not to pay rent for some time. The law in Western Australia makes it difficult to evict tenants without a lengthy time delay. Instead, this tenant spent her rent assistance on things other than that which the tenant received the money for. She left the accommodation worse for wear, did not pass her rental assistance on to pay for the accommodation, and the owner of the property was left out of pocket. If this continues, it will discourage private involvement, place greater pressure on Homeswest&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1528">including the associated costs of putting up with such tenants&mdash;and, at the end of the day, require greater funding to be provided to the states under the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there is a requirement for money spent under this bill to be properly accounted for, the significant sums the government pays out in rental assistance is not accounted for. Greater accountability could be achieved if rental assistance were provided perhaps in the form of vouchers. However, if we were to encourage private sector involvement in the provision of appropriate and affordable housing&mdash;as the preamble to the bill states&mdash;then we need to provide that protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This can be in the form of vouchers so that recalcitrant tenants do not spend their assistance on things other than that which it was intended for. The Commonwealth, as part of the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement, can encourage states to provide better legislation to protect the providers of private rental accommodation. The number of people who have reported to me about their houses being crashed is quite astounding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement is a successful and enduring social policy, having commenced in 1945. Approximately one&hyphen;half of all Commonwealth funding for housing comes from under the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement umbrella, with the remainder going primarily to rent assistance for those in private accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing CSHA was signed in 1989, and the new agreement will commence in 1996. This legislation replaces the legislation of the former government, which lapsed after the election. While there are similarities between the two pieces of legislation, the coalition's bill includes further encouragement of private sector involvement in the provision of appropriate and affordable housing and the offer of greater choice between different forms of assistance, different providers, and the provision of targeted subsidies to home purchase aspirants. This is delivering on the coalition's housing policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that home ownership is the great Australian dream, I welcome greater provisions to assist people who are in the lower <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> income brackets to purchase their home via the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement. Home ownership equates with greater responsibility in looking after the home. There is still no doubt about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement requires cooperation between the state and Commonwealth governments. I am certainly glad that this has occurred in Western Australia. I would like to place on record my respect for those at Homeswest. They are dedicated, committed and hardworking people, who Homeswest tenants are lucky to have working for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian government launched the right to buy scheme in December 1993, with the aim of assisting long&hyphen;term Homeswest tenants to purchase their rental home. As of 31 December 1995, 1,039 properties have been sold&mdash;including, I am happy to say, one to my youngest sister and her husband. Approximately 100 tenants per month are applying to purchase their home, proving the success of the scheme and the desire of people to own their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian government has also instigated the estate improvement program to lower socioeconomic areas and to areas which have high unemployment and crime rates and low property values, some of which the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has recently referred to. The program aims to improve and refurbish public housing estates with emphasis on home ownership and balanced communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) would support me in praising the Pepperwood program in the Lockridge area in his electorate, which is part of the state improvement program. It is also being done in Kwinana, where property values have rapidly increased. The program includes demolishing old flats and subdividing those pieces of land and refurbishing other units for sale on the private market and so on. I understand that crime in Lockridge has gone through the floor. I am glad that the program is soon to be extended to Balga, in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These programs ensure the stereotype attached to such suburbs will evaporate with the integration of private and public sector <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1529"> housing. The communities will benefit greatly from increased home ownership. Obviously, the funding provided through the Commonwealth-state housing agreement is effective and the West Australian government is meeting the challenges set out in this bill as to the goals of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The desirability of this bill to provide assistance where all factors that contribute to the quality of life of the people receiving the assistance is taken into account&mdash;including the liveability of communities, equality of opportunity, non-discrimination and respect for dignity and self&hyphen;esteem for people receiving assistance&mdash;is being achieved by the West Australian government. Indeed, the housing policy has been effective in reducing crime, improving property values and allowing more Australians to strive for the great Australian dream of home ownership. I congratulate the West Australian government and Homeswest for the reforms they have undertaken in recent years and urge them to continue with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I must add my concern about some tenants in Homeswest accommodation requiring other basic essentials. Last Saturday week, one of my staff members was telephoned by a tenant in a Homeswest home who had not had hot water since the previous Wednesday. It was not considered urgent to fix it on the weekend and, while Perth has the best weather in Australia, as you no doubt all know, the constituent could not access hot water. While the objectives of this bill are to be applauded, we still cannot take attention away from the basic maintenance, the provision of heating and other services, that must continue. This ought to be heeded by the states.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is passing strange that we are talking about legislation of $1 billion per year and the serious implications of the changes made, yet the previous speaker, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), spent his time essentially talking about private rental. It gives some indication of the lack of understanding by the new government of the underlying issues involved in the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said previously, this housing legislation is fundamentally that which was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposed by the previous government and passed through this House. The changes that have been brought to it are disturbing. There are two parts that give rise to that. The first is the reduction from three years to one year in the continuity of funding. For a government that is long on rhetoric about state security, the role of the states and all the rest of it to actually tell the states they have only one year's funding so they can plan absolutely undermines any form of economic planning or commonsense. It really does give the lie to so much of the rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part which is disturbing is the removal of the capacity for Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement funds to be used, where appropriate, in design planning and management&mdash;in other words, the impact of the money being spent. Why would the new government, firstly, want to chop it back to one year and then, secondly, take away the capacity to influence its impact on the community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking back, the parliamentary committee chaired by the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) a couple of years ago conducted a parliamentary inquiry into patterns of urban settlement and the impact of that settlement around Australia. We visited all the capital cities and looked very carefully at what had been happening. It was very clear how a lack of thought in housing, residential zoning and planning has caused enormously expensive costs in the development of our city structures. Whether it be in western Sydney with the sewage problems of the Hawkesbury basin or the housing designs in Brisbane, all over Australia we saw impacts caused by a lack of foresight and planning. That was bipartisan. Both sides of parliament accepted that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many parliamentarians on both sides who have local government experience would be very aware of the concerns caused by housing departments in the various states not giving any thought to the impact of what they are doing. We have all seen the development of new estates in the middle of nowhere, with no services in many cases, often no infrastructure and no transport because the land was cheap. We have seen the distortion of our population mixes, our demographics, our education systems being unprepared for it and our sewerage <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1530"> systems being unprepared. We have seen all these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came back into government in 1983, there was an attempt to change the nature, quality and impact of the housing programs. This has been done superbly. The changes in the 12 years have been remarkable. The previous member spoke about rental assistance. Let me explain rental assistance. When I was first elected to parliament in 1983 as part of a Labor government, rental assistance was $5 a week for pensioners&mdash;not unemployed people, just pensioners. For every dollar they earned above their pension, they lost $1 of rent assistance. So anybody earning more than $5 got no rental assistance. It was a joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is equally interesting that the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was part of a government that reduced the contribution of the Commonwealth to public housing by some 40 per cent during the life of the Fraser government&mdash;a massive reduction in the Commonwealth commitment to public housing. What has been the first action of the new government in this area? To grant funds for one year only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pretty obvious what is going to happen next. At the end of this first year we are going to see a similar action to that taken by the Fraser government&mdash;the chop! The Fraser government took 40 per cent out of public housing expenditure during its lifetime with the current Prime Minister as Treasurer. He has been here before. He has a record that is very well known. We are seeing it being repeated in this legislation and, at the same time, all the rhetoric about giving the states a say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Add to those changes the complication whereby something like 180 programs are being transferred from the Commonwealth to the states. We are going to see short&hyphen;term funding and cuts in funding, with the states being given responsibility and no Commonwealth involvement. Hence the clause about there being no control of the impact. People who support public housing in Australia will start worrying right now. It is no wonder we are concerned.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish the government would come out in the open and say what it is going to do. All the body language is fine, and all the shadow&hyphen;boxing is interesting; but the fact is that we have to live in the real world. People need time to plan. If the government is going to slash and burn the housing program, tell us, the public and the states now so that we can plan for it. We saw a massive cut in the departmental capacities in every state during the Prime Minister's time as Treasurer. It was not planned for and it was not announced. At least have the courtesy and the honesty&mdash;belying your supposed title&mdash;to come out and tell us what the plan is. The signs are very disturbing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are a Commonwealth parliament, a national parliament. We have a national responsibility. We can look back over the 13 years of the previous government and see what was initiated by the Commonwealth. I will not list all the changes, because there is probably much too long a list, but I can recall very clearly that the changes to rental assistance were major: from some $163 million per year to some $1.6 billion per year. That is the kind of change I mean: that is serious change but it is supportive and targeted change, and change of the kind that people need. There were enormous changes to SAAP and to support assistance and assisted accommodation. Those enormous changes would never have happened if the Commonwealth had not initiated them. Why did the Commonwealth do it? Because the states were not doing it. This comes up all the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw, back in 1975, the new federalism: the abdication to the states by the Commonwealth of all responsibility. We are seeing the new `new federalism' now, except that they will not talk about it. We watch minister after minister abdicate responsibility, and they seem to be doing it with some sense of pride. As a federal parliamentarian, I find it absolutely amazing that they can stand by and abdicate responsibility for national standards and values and for a national approach to their portfolio areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How on earth can a federal minister for housing say, `I don't want to have any say over what housing does in any community in Australia. I don't care if it destroys the urban <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1531"> fabric and I don't care about the impact. I don't care if there aren't buses or schools or child care where we are placing our public housing tenants. It's none of my business'? How can any federal minister do that and then say they are a federal parliamentarian? They should all shift to the state parliaments and become state parliamentarians, because that is the approach they are taking. The fact is that the states never have had and never can have the capacity to see a national perspective, because they do not live and function and work in the national parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does this go from here? A one&hyphen;year term and no say over impact: the only answer, of course, is down. What does that mean? I should perhaps point out one of the tragedies of this kind of thinking. I have heard those opposite over the past four years denigrate the building better cities program. I want to talk about that for a few moments, as a local member and certainly as an ex&hyphen;representative of local government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A lapsed member. The greatest difficulty, no doubt, is planning. Planning for local government is enormously difficult, with the complications of boundaries, transport and so many other things that they cannot control. We can look at the inner core of cities like Newcastle, which are old industrial cities. The changed usage of technology, of industry and of housing design and technology, and the doughnut effect that we see all over Australia and all over the world, are well classified and well understood, but were the state governments ever addressing the issue? No, they could not. It was just too complicated and too expensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the building better cities program in Newcastle, the Commonwealth has contributed something like $70 million towards a program which is absolutely innovative. It is not about being an alternative to the housing department. It is about demonstrating new ways of doing things and about testing new ideas. Unless somebody takes the time to test, the fact is that the development market will always be 10 or 20 years behind what is possible, because people build only those developments that they can make money on. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That was told to us at almost every hearing we had in the parliamentary inquiry I referred to earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall being told by developers in Brisbane that villa units and small units did not work, because they knew it. They had either six&hyphen;packs or much higher rise buildings. They didn't have the in&hyphen;between or lower level ones, because they said it was not profitable. Yet Adelaide says the opposite. The fact is that the values in those cities are very similar, but what came through very clearly was that the development industry was not in the business of taking risks at all. Unless the system was proven, they wouldn't try it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who is going to develop housing? Who is going to push the boundaries? Who is going to find new ways to repopulate our cities? State governments find themselves incapable, and they normally have only one or two cities anyhow, so to them it is not a major problem. But, as a nation, we have cities all over Australia and to us it is&mdash;or should be&mdash;a major problem, and it was to us in government. It clearly is not one to those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government is back into its old abdication role and is saying, `None of our business!' You can walk through the constitution and you can walk around it&mdash;you can duck and weave all you like&mdash;but the fact is that, as federal parliamentarians, it is your business. You cannot volunteer to come to this place and be a member of the national parliament and then say, `These issues don't concern me.' That is simply a cheap way out, and I would suggest that those who feel that way should go back to being council aldermen or state members. No&hyphen;one should aspire to this place who does not see things from a national perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the Commonwealth is contributing $17 million towards the building better cities program in Newcastle. It has been a very difficult process because it has involved local government, state government and the Commonwealth government in a tripartite approach to rethink and refocus how we do things. It has involved the building industry, the development industry and the community to varying degrees of success. In the last six <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1532"> to nine months we have seen&mdash;and certainly in the next six to 12 months we will see&mdash;some quite dramatic changes coming through. If it were not for that program, I can assure you the inner part of Newcastle would have a much bleaker future than it has now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any members present, especially those on the government side, who represent electorates that have urban decline and urban decay should either tell their minister to look at the building better cities program or go and look at it themselves. They should then tell their minister what they are doing and what is happening here because this government is now walking away from a role which has been established, which has been piloted and which is now being recognised and successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of the states independently running programs of this nature might sound fine in the sense that they can set benchmarks. We set national standards. We can do performance monitoring and audits. We can do all those things, but the fact is that has been the talk for 20 years. The Fraser government said the same kind of stuff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at nursing homes. They are licensed by the state governments. They have been licensed by the state governments for yonks, but it was not until we as the previous government made equality mandatory and sent out inspection teams from the Commonwealth that we started to sort out the internal problems. We begged, pleaded, urged and encouraged both the owners and the state governments to clean up their act. But it was not until we made it mandatory&mdash;in other words, they did not get funded unless they performed&mdash;that anything changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the HACC program. We have benchmarks, we have standards, we have all these other things; but the fact is that the state governments do not enforce it, and I reinforce the fact that, unless the Commonwealth enforces it, it will not happen. The scope for variation between the states in picking up these standards and making them work, whether it be in health, aged residential services, home and community care, housing, homelessness or care for the young, is enormous.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do we have all these services? Why is the Commonwealth involved? As I said earlier in my speech, it is because the states were not doing their jobs. When the community starts to understand this government's real agenda, that of abdication, there will be a massive outcry. The breach of faith involved in what is being done today and being done bit by bit all over the legislative program will be of enormous magnitude when it all comes together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister thinks he can slip, slide and weave his way through all this stuff by saying he is keeping his promises. People are not that stupid or gullible. They will realise that cutting public housing breaches a promise, especially when he is talking about protecting the most vulnerable. You are vulnerable when the rules on rental assistance are shifted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had a phone call the other day from some people in a retirement village. They were absolutely terrified because the story is now very strong and very clear: rental assistance may well be wiped out or certainly changed for people in retirement villages. These people have locked up their incomes and their lives in a fixed pattern. They made decisions for now and until they die based on government policies and what was available. To say to them, `The rules are going to change but we will protect the vulnerable,' is absolutely disgraceful. These people are not stupid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the rhetoric in this chamber and the use of numbers might sound great to that large exuberant backbench, but when it starts happening up there people will say, `Come on, we don't understand that kind of code. We know what you mean when services start to be chopped. You said you'd protect us. You said you would do what Labor was doing and do it better, not the opposite.' Labor would never have done this. We were working with the states to get a truly national approach and a truly cooperative approach, and that was sensible and practical and, what is more, it was effective. It was getting very good results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why change it? Who wants to change it? Whose idea is it? The states do not want one&hyphen;year funding. The states are certainly happy <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1533"> to go along with better cities, so whose idea is it to change it? Where is the saving? What is the benefit? So far in the past month we have not seen one bit of public policy justified. We have seen ad hoc ideological issues coming forward out of nowhere. Not once have we heard anybody say, `This is what Australia needs. We need a public service of so many thousand,' or, `We need a housing expenditure of this amount,' or, `We need a regime of this nature.' There has been none of that. We have heard conclusions with no arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the arguments that were put forward by the previous speaker were not about the legislation; they were about private rental housing. The fact that Homeswest in Western Australia does not provide a weekend service for hot water, and I agree with the member that it should, is not what this is about. If this legislation is passed, we will have even less say over what it provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Stirling is complaining about what Homeswest is doing and how one of his staff members got a phone call about it on the weekend&mdash;I wonder where his state colleague was, incidentally&mdash;but when this bill goes through it will have even less relevance. He should be supporting us so we can keep some say over the spending because eventually we are accountable. The Commonwealth raises the revenue and, eventually, we are accountable. All the ducking and weaving, the slipping and sliding about promises and constitutional responsibility does not wash because if you collect the money and give it to the states you cannot abdicate responsibility for what impact it has and how it is spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what sensible federalism is about. This is not federalism; it is competition between states as to who can beggar thy neighbour. This government will be held accountable for its actions, not in the next few months but eventually. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the Housing Assistance Bill 1996. In particular, it gives me a sense of pride, being the member for Chifley, that we are actually talking about a measure originally introduced by Prime Minister Chifley in 1945; that is, with the prospect of the Second World <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> War ending and there being a gross shortage of housing, the Commonwealth should play a role in trying to overcome the shortage of housing. Therefore, we have the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement and we have this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I am pleased the government has retained is the proposition that the maximum amount of rent paid by a public housing tenant should be 25 per cent of income. I commend the government for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken before in this House about a particular problem that occurs in my electorate, which, in fact, has the highest density of public housing of any electorate&mdash;so I am led to believe&mdash;in New South Wales. There is a requirement by some state housing departments, including my own state, that where children or other members of that household other than the prime tenants receive income that income is taken into account as far as the rent is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who is sitting opposite, has a deep and abiding concern for families, but this really does put an exceptional strain on these families. In my household it is true that my children are now at the age where they can earn some money, but they are not compelled to pay for the rental of the house. I am not responsible for them paying towards the rental of the house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where you have a public tenant or someone who is on Austudy or someone who has an apprenticeship or someone who is working in the work force, the parents assume a responsibility for the siblings actually paying rent, and it puts a strain on families. I know that children have been forced out of the family home because of this. I ask the honourable parliamentary secretary, given the rhetoric on the other side about families and given that I know his genuine concern about families, how can it be that we stand in this parliament and be proud of an agreement that has the effect of busting up some families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there is an argument about capacity to pay and a fair return on assets. Whilst this may be very logical and economically rational, I think we ought to look at what some of its side effects are. So I would seek that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1534"> government try to address this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you are probably quite aware that 50 per cent of the money the Commonwealth spends in this area goes to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. My own state of New South Wales receives $257 million as a block grant, $18.5 million for pensioner housing, $17.8 million for Aboriginal housing, $23.4 million for community housing, $10.5 million for mortgage and rent relief, and $13.5 million for crisis accommodation. This makes a total of $341 million in a budget of over $1 billion. I think that is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point I want to note is that we are reducing the agreement from a three-year term&mdash;so that states are able to plan and budget and expend their money on a rolling basis over a three-year period&mdash;to 12 months. I think this is very unfortunate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Much of the public housing in my electorate is now 30 years old. I am really delighted that I was able to participate in a ceremony in Bidwill, where the state government made the announcement&mdash;using Commonwealth money&mdash;that it was planning to spend $2 million on upgrading and refurbishing the whole estate of Bidwill. I think that was really exciting news. In addition to that, there were already pre-existing proposals to try to revamp a very modest town square and to change the name from Bidwill to Bidwill Gardens. I might point out that Bidwill was named after John Carne Bidwill, one of the early botanists at the Botanical Gardens, so it is singularly appropriate that not only should we wish to change the name to Bidwill Gardens but we should want to green it at the same time. We might even be able to experiment with community gardens at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, starting this year, the state government is spending $2 million on the basis of this Commonwealth-state housing agreement. What will be involved is planning. They will try to involve the community by getting community input and then they will come up with an agreed community plan to change the public housing stock in Bidwill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this bill does, of course, is place great uncertainty on that whole process. I think that is a real tragedy. I would like to leave this debate knowing that the excitement of the people of Bidwill can be sustained, realistically knowing that not only will this money that will be spent on planning come to fruition but also the many extra millions of dollars will be spent on refurbishing Bidwill. Of course, Bidwill was but one suburb on a rolling list within my electorate. So I am very apprehensive about the change of government and the new government's policies in relation to the refurbishment of Bidwill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also said something at that ceremony. I have to be very careful to source these ideas. They came from a book from America. I cannot recall the author, but there are some very exciting things being done in housing stock in America; that is, they allow the tenants to develop a cooperative where they can collect the rent. I would imagine the rental collection from a cooperative of tenants would overcome the current problem that state departments of housing have with the rent strike situation that occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that, but they allow the same tenants to be involved in the minor repairs and upgrading that are inherent in any public housing estate. So you really do have a number of processes occurring. Firstly, you have an empowerment process where the tenants are actually in charge of their own destiny. They are making decisions about their own destiny and their own housing. Many of course are unemployed and getting employment through actually being involved in the repairing and maintenance of that housing stock. Secondly, you get a real strong community feel. Unfortunately, Bidwill, along with the other Mount Druitt suburbs&mdash;and I am not trying to score points here&mdash;was a legacy of the Askin government, where little thought was put into how to identify a suburb and give it some cohesion and sense of purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1535"> There is no physical demarcation between the suburbs, so you can actually drive from one to another. There are no trees and no creeks&mdash;none of that sort of planning. Quite frankly, some of the housing stock is abso lutely appalling. There is this problem of a constant churn factor within my suburbs&mdash;and Bidwill, to that extent, is no exception&mdash;in that people are constantly moving in and, as soon as they have moved in, they try to get out and find a better location. Whilst not all the problems can be seated down to it, many of the problems are man&hyphen;made&mdash;I say `man&hyphen;made' because they were men at that time&mdash;and the result of human planning; and of course this redesign is an opportunity to rectify it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other clause that is being taken out refers specifically to the use of housing as a tool in design, planning or management of cities and towns. I think it would be pretty awful if we did a piecemeal redevelopment of any of those suburbs like Bidwill, Whalan, Wilmont or Shalvey. The really exciting thing is that you can involve the whole community and grab their energy, enthusiasm and ideas and translate that into something that they want and see as desirable. But doing it on a piecemeal basis, I think, is the wrong way to go and I find it very difficult to understand why the government would want to pursue that particular issue and take it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that they have always stated objections to the better cities program, although I cannot but comment favourably on the impact of that program in my own electorate. If that concept of better cities were used to even further enhance the public housing stock in my electorate, I would have to say that the people would be the great winners. You are denying yourself that opportunity and they will not understand why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Labor Party we sometimes get into debates about an issue on which we fight very vigorously, but we can come down on different sides of the debate; and therefore I want to concede the arguments of my opponents but tell you where I particularly stand on the issue of tenants being able to purchase their houses. Of course, in my state and, I believe, a lot of other states, in the past we had a history of encouraging, indeed subsidising, if you like, public tenants into ownership. It was really marvellous because often in a family you would see the first home owner emerge as a result of that process.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, when you put lots of people in a suburb&mdash;a public housing estate&mdash;you have problems. Places like Seven Hills and Lalor Park in the past have had those reputations. But those suburbs&mdash;not in my electorate, I might add&mdash;in particular were able to take advantage of moving tenants in to become purchasers of their houses and it added a great deal of stability to those suburbs. I have the aspiration of better allowing public tenants to acquire their houses in my electorate. Again, I know that this defies rational economics and I sincerely apologise to all those in this House of that belief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that I want to refer to which is held by others is the importance of maintaining a stock of public housing and that if you do as I suggest then you are actually effectively pushing public housing tenants further and further out of Sydney. As I have said, I have always conceded that argument. But wanting to meet the hopes and aspirations of ordinary people&mdash;in this case, renters of public housing&mdash;in being able to purchase a house and what that does to the individual, the family and the community is something that perhaps should override it. I do not argue for maintenance of the funding that is going to public housing; in fact, I argue for an increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 13 years that the Labor Party was in government, I think the number of people on the waiting list has gone from something like 126,000 to 232,000. You might say that that is a terrible record, but of course a lot of people were satisfied within that period. A whole group of people were recognised for the first time, and that is young people, who were previously excluded from aspiring to public housing. That is part, but not all, of the reason for the increase. Surely, any government which aspires to carry the mantle of concern for families would wish to reduce the list of people waiting to get into public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be remiss of me if I did not congratulate the New South Wales state government for changing a particular policy that was of concern to some of the older constituents in my electorate. For very worthwhile reasons, New South Wales had adopted the practice of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1536"> mixing tenants. Flats that had once been exclusively for older people&mdash;senior citizens, pensioners&mdash;accommodated a variety of other people, often much younger. Theoretically, there were reasons for that being desirable and beneficial, but in practice it never worked in my electorate. In fact, some senior citizen tenants, constituents of mine, were terrorised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I congratulate the New South Wales Labor government for reversing that policy. Senior citizens in public housing will not now have that worry. In their remaining years they can be proud of their homes and feel safe and secure in them. That is a basic right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last, but not least, I want to point out that, while we already have a significant waiting list, the ageing of our population means that the call on public housing for pensioners will increase rather than decrease. We often hear it said that our richest resource is people, particularly our young people, but there are so many of us in the western suburbs that our need for aged housing will increase dramatically over the years. Frankly, there is little provision for it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the amendment that has been moved by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). The government should not be embarrassed by the full support it has received for this bill. The need for housing is there. If you are concerned about families you cannot distance yourself from the need to house families right across the range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, interesting things are happening in America. We should be piloting those sorts of projects, be it in the electorate of my friend the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), my own electorate or someone else's electorate. Let's try some different things that empower tenants and families, allowing them to have a say in the way housing stock is managed and operated, liberating them and giving employment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have concerns about the direction taken by the new government&mdash;which, from its numbers in this chamber, was certainly given a very substantial mandate by the people on 2 March&mdash;although the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who is at the table, is known for his compassion and concern. As the government pursues what it refers to as the `$8 billion black hole', I hope it does not chop into programs where the most vulnerable people&mdash;the most vulnerable families&mdash;in the community are likely to be adversely affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The so&hyphen;called $8 million black hole has become almost an obsession with the government. The frontbench&mdash;even backbenchers when they are asking questions&mdash;continually refer to its existence. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as all members on this side of the chamber know, the claim is false and cynical, and we will be taking every opportunity to expose it. We have taken the opportunity already in the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply debate and the debate on the supply bills.

If the government thinks it is going to find $8 billion by chopping into programs that put people into houses, that put kids into schools, that put people into hospital beds, that provide assistance and security for people in their retirement, it had better think again. If members opposite want to enjoy the luxury of sitting on those government benches, then they need to understand perfectly that they will need to act as a government for all Australians&mdash;as the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said before the election, for all of us. We still do not know where the emphasis was placed in that slogan. But as time proceeds we will find out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to emphasise that the first Commonwealth-state housing agreement was introduced in 1945 by the Chifley government. That is not unexpected. When you look for examples of social initiatives, social reforms and social programs, it is understandable, you will see, that programs of that kind would be introduced by Labor governments. I am pleased that there has been, to some extent at least, a bipartisan commitment to the continuation of those programs. It is important that that type of commitment continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I was concerned, though, by some aspects of the second reading speech of the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultur al Affairs (Mr Ruddock). To a large extent I was concerned about the fact that the speech was more enlightening by what was not said than what was said. We know, for example&mdash;and the shadow minister has adequately drawn attention to the fact&mdash;that, while we were prepared to make a three&hyphen;year commitment to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, the present government has chosen to make a one&hyphen;year commitment only. That is part of the subject of the amendment that the shadow minister moved at the second reading stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading speech, the minister referred to a new Commonwealth-state housing agreement with the states and territories and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for the purpose of providing housing assistance so that people may achieve housing that is affordable, secure and appropriate to their needs.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope they are not just words. I hope it is a guarantee to continue the commitment that the former Labor government made and the Whitlam government made before that, following on from its initial introduction by the Chifley government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Ruddock said that, through this bill, the government is demonstrating its commitment to the agreement as an instrument in guiding national housing policy. Then Mr Ruddock said that we want to signal clearly our commitment. I do not know whether a signal for a commitment of this kind is sufficient. After this current annual commitment, we want to see a future commitment to putting people into adequate housing taken further. Then he said that the government is keen to implement longer term reforms. I do not want keenness on the part of the government. I want to see all that translated into effective programs and genuine commitments to the necessary funding that is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also referred to the need to achieve greater improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of government housing assistance. We have no argument with that. In fact, to a very large extent, they were efforts made by the previous government in making sure that not only the effectiveness and efficiency of this particular program was adequate but also the whole approach of the national government towards the question of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1538"> housing was balanced, coordinated and integrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, I want to refer to an observation that was made by the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), who drew on information which was made available initially in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper at the beginning of last year. He said that the number of families on waiting lists for public housing grew from 126,000 in 1982 to 232,000 in 1993-94. That was in a Labor government period. I have just been talking about a commitment on the part of a Labor government to housing. People ask: how do you reconcile those two statements?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the chief reasons for that increase was the fact that as a result of all of these structural changes that have taken place in Australian industry during those years there were at the same time very significant social changes that took place. That was largely as a result of very deliberate policies on the part of the Hawke government in the first place and then the Keating government to make the Australian economy a much more flexible, adaptable, competitive and efficient economy so that we could compete with the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, as a result of deliberate government policies in restructuring the economy and as a result of technological change that was taking place in Australia and throughout the world, we had high levels of structural unemployment. So what had started to appear was that in those areas of relatively high unemployment there tended to become a concentration of public sector housing. That is not necessarily good from the point of view of social considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to ensure a more effective distribution of people who needed assistance to get into houses, the Hawke&hyphen;Keating governments provided greater assistance by way of rental assistance. That rental assistance increased from $163 million in 1982-83 to $1.4 billion in 1994-95. That is an increase in real terms of almost 400 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of the member for the Northern Territory, but he saw that figure and thought there was some significance in it. I think he should see <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it needs to be balanced against that enormous increase in the assistance that was made available for rented accommodation for people. People do not like these terms being used, but this was so that we did not finish up with ghettos of public sector housing in areas of high unemployment. That is not socially desirable. When I use that expression I do so with goodwill, but people know exactly what I am talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are enough problems for those people who are trying to survive without finding themselves in areas of depressed services that are often associated with community arrangements of that kind. So it has been possible for those families to be more effectively spread through the general community, and I applaud it&mdash;some of the great levellers in a community of the kind we live in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we aspire towards what we call egalitarianism, equality, justice, fairness and just a reasonable fair go for people and there are significant disparities of abilities, incomes and wealth, we will provide people with at least a certain fundamental number of basic services and rights as human beings and families. One of those is the right to live in a decent home. If people cannot provide that for themselves for whatever reasons, because we live in a humane, hopefully, and civilised community there is a responsibility on all of the community collectively to make sure that everyone enjoys the opportunity to live in decent types of housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second basic right is that of everyone to send their kids to school and know that those children are going to get a reasonable level of education so that there will be opportunities for them to unleash whatever capacities they have and to achieve whatever optimum their own abilities may be able to lead them to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third one is a job. On that last issue we have not performed too well&mdash;not only in Australia but also in all of those Western countries which have all adopted, to a large extent, similar types of programs and approaches to the problems that had to be addressed. But we have not performed too well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1539">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are people who are so supportive of the type of mixed economy that we have, people who insist on what we have come to call economic rationalism, even if it is not very rational. I know that the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) prefers to call it economic fundamentalism, which I think is probably a more appropriate term. If this system that we operate in and try to manage is not capable of providing people with the opportunity to make their dignified contribution to the collective efforts of the community and to earn their income, then there is something wrong with that system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be perfectly clear. If there is something wrong with that system, as there quite clearly is, then there must be better approaches. We might not have the capacity, the skill, the wit or the wisdom to identify what those better approaches are, but there must be some which will provide people with the right to employment. We would not have, for example, 10 per cent of our labour productive capacity being wasted every day because 10 per cent of the people who want to work are not working. That becomes an enormous cumulative volume of potential production and welfare, material wellbeing, that we sacrifice along the way. All we need to do is apply our talents and I am sure we will all be able to find a better way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government since 1983, the period of the Hawke and Keating governments, increased the public housing stock by over 137,000 units. By this year the total number of units was expected to reach 400,000. They are figures of great importance, not only in terms of public policy but also in terms of those families that have been and continue to be so dependent upon the public sector for their housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the national government and through the state governments, which act to a large extent as the administrative arms for these programs, they are ultimately dependent upon their neighbours. That is what we talk about when we refer to collective responsibilities and collective efforts. In the last three years alone there have been well over half a  million new dwelling commencements. Low income earners renting privately receive rent <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> assistance now totalling, as I said, $1.5 billion. In the three years to June of this year another 158,000 people have been placed in public housing. It is important for us to keep in mind the social importance, the individual importance and the family importance for those people who have been dependent upon it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred earlier to the fact that the Labor government's approach to the question of housing had been an integrated and coordinated one. So it was not just throwing money in one direction. What they did was concentrate on a coordinated approach to questions of public housing, home purchase, private renters, housing and industry exports, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing, homelessness, women escaping domestic violence, new homes for young people and the replacement of old homes with new. All of those, as you know, came together into a coordinated whole which, to a very large extent, has been enormously successful in meeting the moral and the national responsibilities of a national government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only hope that the new government will continue with those initiatives, will continue with the commitment and will maintain the level of funding so that those people who benefit most by it will have the opportunity to continue to share the benefits of this community with their neighbours.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since time immemorial fairy tales and other such stories have been used as an effective tool to illustrate one's point. I will start my last paragraph again. The first little pig was a paid&hyphen;up member of the Liberal Party. He decided, without any real thought, to build his home out of straw. If it was good enough for his grandfather, it was good enough for him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second pig was a member of the National Party. She put a little more thought into her dwelling&mdash;she used sticks. The third little pig was a paid&hyphen;up member of the Australian Labor Party. He was a smart pig. Indeed, he later went on to become a movie star. He was, of course, a paid&hyphen;up member of both the Australian Workers Union and the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third little pig saw the folly of his brother's and his sister's approaches to housing, planning and construction. Both had built their homes, he believed, of substandard material and had given little thought to the location of their dwellings. His elder brother had put his straw house on a built&hyphen;up swamp some distance out of town and was having difficulty getting to and from work, not to mention the problems with rising damp. His sister built in a subdivision far away from her friends and her family and she was missing the regular contact with both. The local child&hyphen;care facility was unable to take her kids because of the recent large influx of people into the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third little pig quite wisely decided not to repeat the mistakes of his brother and his <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sister. He thought about the future and chose a vacant block in a proposed urban renewal area close to the train station and only two bus stops from his parents' home. He decided he did not need a big house to himself and chose to erect a brick duplex on his block. He knew that one day he would probably have a family and might decide to move to another part of town. But, for the moment, he believed, a duplex seemed the logical choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He designed his duplex with a package of environmentally conscious energy saving features. He positioned it well on the block to maximise temperature control. He strategically placed windows and eaves to capture natural air flows and light. He used good soundproofing and he used landscaping to ensure privacy from his neighbours. This little pig did not have to endure the ravages of the wolf, because he had planned and used good design principles to build his home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This may be an adaption of a children's story, but the lessons for this government are salient. The moral to this story is that one must think ahead. In other words, one must plan. The former government's bill has been gutted by the removal from this bill of the subsequent year's funding commitment and the removal of its planning component. The pillars which hold up the Commonwealth-state housing agreement have been removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public housing is not just about shelter. It is not just about bricks and mortar. As our third little pig realised, it is also about things like jobs and educational opportunities; it is really about a sense of belonging to your community. Public housing is not something that can be left to market forces to determine. People invest a large portion of their lives in their homes and in their communities. As my colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) pointed out in her most effective speech on this subject in the second reading debate, it is often unfair to ask people to uproot and move away from the town they have lived in all of their lives, even if employment opportunities in that area may be scarce. I agree that these areas should be renewed, not abandoned. This is very relevant to towns in rural and regional Australia which have lost traditional industries. We need to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1541"> plan and broaden the economic base of these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I equate these areas with my home town of Cessnock. The local government area spans some 2,000 square kilometres, yet its population numbers only about 46,000. Within the local government area exist 23 separate villages. Those villages exist for one reason alone: they were established to support the local coalmine in the area. The villages remain, but the mines have moved on. The Cessnock local government area receives about one million visitors a year to its vineyard area, but people visiting the vineyard area have to travel through the town proper. It is a little sad for me to say that the town is not necessarily a pretty site. It is struggling, like many other rural and regional communities. Along with the wonderful work being done in the Honeysuckle project in Newcastle, much can be done under these types of funding arrangements to help declining towns like Cessnock in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with the city, country areas need well planned and designed housing. Because of transport and access issues, the need is even more acute in rural and regional Australia. When planning our towns and cities and their public housing requirements, we must be sensitive to changing needs. As identified in the 1994 housing assistance annual report, the major challenge we face in the next century is responding to the changing demand for housing and the nature of housing supply. That report identified pressures arising from the growing numbers of older people, sole parents, later marriages and smaller families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government's response to the ever-changing needs of society leaves it with an excellent track record in this very important area of social policy. Unlike our conservative opponents, we believe that government has a real and important role to play in ensuring social equality. Under the stewardship of the former Labor minister, Brian Howe, we have witnessed real improvements in housing standards, housing design and the affordability and availability of housing in Australia. It is most important that this work is recorded in history as the work of Brian Howe and the work of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As outlined in its explanatory memorandum, this bill authorises financial assistance by the Commonwealth to the states and territories. It allows for the provision of housing assistance. The objective is to ensure that people can obtain housing that is affordable, secure and appropriate to their needs. Accordingly, the bill aims to provide people on low incomes with home ownership assistance or affordable and appropriate rental housing. It dictates that the accommodation should be of adequate size, acceptable amenity and should be strategically located.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill specifies that these aims will be achieved by, firstly, identifying needs for housing; secondly, providing or arranging for the provision of housing assistance; thirdly, giving the assistance in ways that are effective; fourthly, encouraging the provision of different kinds of housing assistance; and, fifthly, ensuring that the rights of people receiving housing assistance are properly protected and due regard is had for their rights and responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is good to see that the coalition is not entirely jettisoning all of Brian Howe's good work. The bill authorises the funding of the Commonwealth-State housing agreement. In other words, it authorises the Commonwealth to provide assistance to the states and territories in the area of housing assistance. But it is not just a handout; it is about entering into a partnership with the states in order to provide decent and affordable housing to all Australians. It is about ensuring that the great Australian dream&mdash;the dream of home ownership&mdash;is a possibility for people on low incomes as well as those well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do. Even more importantly, it is about ensuring the availability and affordability of appropriate rental housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is almost identical to the former Labor government's bill which intended that housing assistance should be directed towards people who are on low incomes or otherwise face barriers in obtaining the housing they need. It is not what the bill does but what it does not do that is of concern to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1542"> The new government has bastardised the former government's bill in two ways. Firstly, the bill provides funding for the 1996-97 fin ancial year only and, secondly, the states' ability to use funds provided under the Commonwealth-State housing agreement for the design, planning and management of cities and towns has been removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the first point. By committing itself to the funding of the agreement for one year only, the government has destroyed the true essence of the scheme. It is not holding up its end of the partnership. How can the states be expected to properly plan in such an important area without guaranteed funding continuity? How can the states enter into contractual arrangements if they are not fully informed of the terms? Let me quote from the second reading speech of the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding for subsequent years will be determined as part of the Commonwealth budgetary process . . . </PARA>

<PARA>Again, code for, `It will be cut.' This is the best part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and the report of the National Commission of Audit.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the second part of the minister's quote appears to be a softener for later cuts in Commonwealth housing assistance. `Sorry,' they will tell the states, `you've failed to commit yourselves to our long-term reforms and the auditors say we need to save the money.' I wonder how that excuse will go down with the people in my electorate on the public housing waiting list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this quote may also reflect the coalition's desire to get out of housing and lump it back upon the states. The Liberal Party is and has always been a states rights party. The partnership between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories is crucial to the success of the aims of this bill. As in all successful partnerships, there has to be a level of trust and understanding. The previous government fostered this trust and as a result was able to develop excellent public housing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> programs. The former government has provided the broad policy direction and funding, while the states have effectively undertaken the task of implementing the objectives of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now turn to the second point. The ability to use funds provided under the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement for the design, planning and management of cities has been removed from the bill. This is probably the bill's most crucial fall. The key to providing decent standards of living lies in the creation of opportunities. In Australia, these opportunities should be provided to people within their own local communities. If opportunities are not provided to people within or near their existing communities, they will simply miss out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people we are attempting to assist with the measures taken in this bill cannot afford to be uprooted or to uproot their families and move on; nor should they have to. They are worthy of special consideration. These local opportunities can be created only through long-term planning and social infrastructure development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The words `design', `planning' and `management' roll easily off the tongue. I would like to address each of them individually, as they should form an integral part of any housing assistance strategy. The first is design, which is one of the great problems with housing in this country. Poor design results in poor aesthetics, environmental degradation, poor amenity, conflict between neighbours resulting from a lack of privacy, poor access and poor security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, good design can not only create comfortable, appropriate and environmentally friendly living but also gain for us as a nation recognition on the world stage. Adequate design funding and the use of new technologies should be the charter for public housing assistance. Public housing should be the frontrunner in Australian design excellence. It is an area in which no compromise is acceptable. We should be striving to provide the best public housing in the world and then marketing and exporting our designs as construction technologies to other countries around the globe.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1543">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area to which I wish to refer is planning. How many towns around Australia are hamstrung as a result of a complete lack of planning? By removing this important facet of the bill, we are adopting a bandaid solution to housing. Without adequate, long&hyphen;range planning we risk undoing much of the excellent reform that has been done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Urban and rural development requires a totally integrated approach from federal, state and local governments. Public housing is an integral part of urban development. What we cannot afford is the `hand it back to the states and let them worry about it' attitude espoused by the coalition. We have all seen the damage which flows from the housing commission area stigma. This is the result of poor planning and one that should never be repeated in Australian urban planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It worries me that the removal of planning as a responsibility of this bill will result in the return of outdated planning practices in the area of public housing. Effective and sometimes radical housing reform requires consultation, and time must be allowed to put the correct models in place. The immensity of investment calls for careful consideration. The public housing we provide needs to enhance the landscape and fulfil the ever&hyphen;changing needs of its recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area is management. The management of these processes is crucial to their success. We must ensure excellence in delivery of housing assistance. People in receipt of housing assistance should not be treated any differently from their privately housed counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other facet of management is the need for cooperation to properly manage the services in our cities and our towns. We must foster cooperation between the three levels of government to ensure the most effective use of the limited funds available to us. This bill does not encourage that partnership or the integrated approach. The concept of integrated local area planning is obviously lost on the parliamentary Liberal Party, whose approach to all areas of policy reflects the strong influence of the individual states and the wider party structure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Hunter region, and including local governments in my own area, the regional organisation of councils, Hunter ROC, is presently developing a working model for integrated local area planning.

The project takes into consideration population trends, employment opportunities, land use issues, transport and access needs, individual requirements and projected public housing needs. I warn the government that I will be fighting for its support on these important projects.</PARA>

A year is just not enough time to get a package like this to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is not unlike the one that we were working on last year. In fact, much of the Labor platform on housing has been mentioned in the bill's second reading speech. But by only giving it a year it becomes an interim measure. Until when? Is it going to be thrown out the window this time next year? How can anyone plan with this sort of scenario?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people tamper with housing they tamper with one of the essentials in life, and that is shelter. Without accessible, affordable and secure housing, other things such as jobs, proper meals, health and cleanliness become an impossibility. The prospect of gaining <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1544"> quality in one's life becomes bleak. The last government recognised that changes needed to be made to the philosophy of public housing. The original dream of public housing for all was not achievable or desirable for many people. It is seen now as welfare housing, and there has never been an adequate supply of public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the needy are prioritised according to greatest need and there is no avenue for the more well&hyphen;off to help subsidise those with less&mdash;as is the case in other models and older models of public housing. This makes public housing as such in Australia an absurd concept and one that is guaranteed to put a stigma on the housing and the people within it. In Tasmania, in the middle of the 1970s, 5,000 families were on the list for public housing. In the middle of the 1990s, they are still there. Remember that Tasmania's population does not grow and we have gone backwards a bit over that time. It was also the time when I was living in a public housing estate, now in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick. The 5,000 families in 1970 and the 5,000 families in 1990 are probably different people, but it is the same need and there is just not the housing to cope with it; nor will there be unless public and private housing can be made more accessible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a move to subsidise the tenants rather than housing. In Tasmania, unless we get reform to our tenancy laws, there will be a disaster. It will lock those on low incomes into a round of housing that is old, undermaintained and decrepit, yet the rents will be at the higher margin of the subsidy. In England, where similar arrangements are in place, there is an underground market of slum properties, as tenants which are eligible for the subsidy and looking for housing are identified as being in a low income bracket. Those properties are then put forward but with upper market rents&mdash;rents at the top end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This situation works both ways. If landlords do not have some form of insurance to ensure that their investment is secure, then they will not bother to invest in decent or clean housing. Tenants will be stuck with insecurity, evictions and discrimination because they are on a benefit and have little hope of getting out of the trap they are in.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a bit of publicity lately&mdash;I think it was in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, so you would be aware of it&mdash;in relation to two public houses that were so-called trashed. The press put the blame on the tenants, implying that they were ungrateful wretches for not appreciating and looking after public housing. It is hard to imagine what some of those people actually go through in some of those housing areas or go through to get housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often those people who have no access to housing of any sort who cause the problem for public housing tenants. Some may have been denied housing, some may have been evicted or some may not qualify because they did not have enough points in the system due to the fact that they are not in extreme poverty or in danger of domestic violence. Maybe they had become disillusioned with life in some other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They can sometimes threaten and frighten other tenants because the tenant has a house and they do not have access to one. They have nothing to lose. They do not understand that they are depriving people of housing. If they have never had a secure house themselves, how are they supposed to know what being responsible is all about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A house is often trashed because it is vacant, the tenants have fled, and it is a short-term squat for the dispossessed until it is finally trashed. This happens because there is insufficient suitable housing available. There needs to be more housing. There needs to be a quicker turnaround in the existing housing to help lessen the time vandals have to trash a house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1545"> Under the CSHA we must look at the cost of not housing people. There is a cost when you do not house people, when you do not give them the shelter they need. There is a link between the lack of affordable housing and homelessness. The impact of poor housing on the health and educational opportunities of individuals is great. There are economic costs and there are great social costs. Already we have heard of some of the costs to the community such as the trashed houses, as I mentioned. Other costs include family breakdowns, physical and mental health pro blems, the interruption of formal education and disruption in schools, unemployment, social isolation, violence and criminal activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the new arrangements, where the states are using the community and charitable sector to carry out some of the welfare work, are becoming more and more difficult to administer, mainly because the money is not given to assist in administration costs. Departments carry the administration costs through many means. There are fewer resources available to the community sector. Each cut to funding has restricted them even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any agreement must resource properly those who are administering any moneys of government. It is no good starting up a program one year, as this bill will do, and maybe defunding it the next. Whole groups of people who may have been helped for the first time face being abandoned again next year. Such a group is the elderly and frail poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Either through adversity or family disaster, people are living in boarding houses, in hostels or on the streets. They are either being preyed upon by unscrupulous carers or being tossed out of rooming and boarding houses because there are no funds to support them. The charities are overloaded and cannot cope with some of these additions without funding. So these people are left to live on the street or at the mercy of exploiters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CSHA helps towards the administration of other government programs such as assistance for care and housing for the aged, which copes with another housing angle. It was a good program and was actually helping people&mdash;some for the very first time. Now, I understand, it may be cut too. I think the debate has to go on about public housing, because there is a need for public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many alternative forms of tenure to private housing, and some of my colleagues have mentioned those in this debate tonight. There is community housing, cooperatives or tenant associations, but there is no real alternative to public housing. Subsidies can help some sectors, but if the housing is not there in the first place how will funds ultimately help? They cannot.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CSHA is a way the Commonwealth can keep an eye across the states to ensure that the funds for housing are spent on that and in that way. We need to ensure that there is an overall direction on how to make the most of the funds available. We all know of states not using any initiative and not coming up with any of the ideas in the past, and it has always been the Commonwealth money that has taken us down a new direction. The building better cities program is one of those in which we have been able to look at alternative housing in different ways. Of course, in the Launceston area in Tasmania the building better cities program has been one which we hope will assist in that way. I think the one in the south near your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, which was on the drawing board, has probably already been lost&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, there are not a lot in mine, but there is some public housing. There are housing needs in my electorate, but most of the homeless kids in my electorate end up in Launceston or in Hobart. There are people in need of public housing right throughout my electorate, and there is public housing in some of the smaller towns. Tasmania has had a lot of public housing over many years to assist workers who have come to particular sites to take up employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of new ideas in housing, and they need to be piloted and mentored. Ultimately it will save money, but the Commonwealth has the responsibility to ensure that the states trial and pilot new ideas. Keeping the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement intact and workable over the three years is the only way we can help states overcome their housing and other related social problems, because housing is related so much to so many other issues in our community. Shelter is so important to people. Without it, they can be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we need to maintain three&hyphen;year funding agreements with the states in order to continue to have some influence over the states to look at those new ideas and to help promote new ideas in housing. I understand there are different people taking up this challenge around the world. They are writing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1546"> academically and looking at ways to house people by using different models and different concepts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to be involved in that, we need to be on the edge of that and we need to have a national government which is helping initiate those ideas. That can come only from this parliament, from a minister going in to bat, winning the battle within the cabinet, then pursuing his act and the funding that is coming from within the states and making sure that those seven different areas out there will achieve a result. Of course, what we are hearing at the moment from the present minister and the present government is that we are going to give it back to the states and the states are going to look after it. So there will not be any more initiatives or ideas. `It will not be my problem'&mdash;they are giving it away in that sense. I believe that will take us backwards. I do not see us going forward in housing policy with that approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Tasmania, housing was put in the Department of Community Services and Health some years ago and housing policy seems to have been lost totally. Articles on housing or housing policy or debates in the Tasmanian parliament about housing are few and far between. We need new ideas, we need to continue to look for those ideas and we need a government which can keep some light on those states to keep them looking for those new ideas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the amendment. I believe that it will certainly add greatly to the bill. I believe that members would do well to give the amendment support when it comes before them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting in this debate that only one or two members from that side of the House have spoken on this housing bill. I do not think many people on that side of the house have had to worry very much about their housing or their shelter.</PARA>

The honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) implicitly put the proposition that we should have accepted a bill proposed by the former government without giving any considered attention to the arrangements to be concluded between the Commonwealth and the states in the light of our policies, priorities and commitments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the bill is to ensure that for a period of 12 months there is an ongoing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1547"> commitment of the funds to be specifically appropriated for this purpose. There is a capacity for the government to come to some decisions in the light of whatever consideration it gives to the matters that have been raised in those deliberations with the states.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the states are keen to see this bill go through as quickly as possible, to see the funds appropriated, and to be involved in the necessary dialogue. I will inform my colleague the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) of the remarks made by the honourable member for Jagajaga, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) and invite her to take up, where appropriate, some of their suggestions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of such a wide&hyphen;ranging debate, many of the matters raised went beyond the ambit of the bill even where they related specifically to housing. I noticed that the honourable member for Stirling raised the matter of rent assistance, the way it might be applied and whether there could be arrangements to ensure that landlords are able to&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad the honourable member suggests that. I will let the Minister for Social Security know that if she is considering the proposal made by the honourable member for Stirling she might have support from the honourable member for Hunter. If she thinks it is a matter that can be pressed&mdash;ensuring that landlords' interests are protected in relation to rent assistance payments&mdash;she would like to know that there is support from the other side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Jagajaga has proposed amending the bill so that agreements entered into under the proposed measure will operate for up to three years from 1 July, involve Commonwealth funding of $1,067,863,000 in each of those three years to be distributed on the same approximately <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per capita basis as existing Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing funds are applied, and explicitly allow those funds to be used where appropriate for the design, planning and management of cities and towns. It is our view that the first point is a misinterpretation of the government's intention with this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I noted in my second reading speech, the interim agreement, to apply from 1 July 1996, will operate for up to three years and will form the basis for implementing longer term directions. The government appreciates that the states would like greater certainty for later years. Unfortunately, in light of the budgetary task ahead of this government, it is not possible to give such an assurance at this time. Whereas the agreement is negotiated with a capacity to deal with matters for up to three years, you must understand that the funding levels will be looked at in the context of the budgetary task ahead of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the government has committed itself in advance to an audit commission report to maintain that funding for 1997 demonstrates its commitment to a continual partnership with the states for the provision of housing assistance. I am sure the honourable member is aware that the proposal to explicitly allow Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement funds to be used with regard to design, planning and management of cities and towns is unnecessary and will not of itself achieve anything. Lack of such wording does not mean that the funds cannot be used for such purposes, nor does it represent a lack of interest on the part of this government in the role of local government in such areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's election policy states that the Liberal and National government will develop and improve community awareness of urban and regional design issues and opportunities in association with state governments and representatives of local government and industry and work with the states, territories and local government, together with the various interested professional organisations, to advance and assess the results of the urban and regional design for Australian communities. Again, I thank honourable members, on behalf of Senator Newman, for their contributions to this debate. I foreshadow that we will not be acceding to the amendment now or the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1548"> later amendment that will seek to make alterations to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Preamble, page 3, lines 22 and 23, after "work in cooperation with local governing bodies" insert ", as appropriate, in view of the regulatory and other functions of those bodies with respect to the design, planning and management of cities and towns".</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to see this text reinserted into the preamble of the bill. It was in the bill that was presented to this House last year. As many people in this House have already indicated, it is a very important part of the legislation, because it is incumbent on us to take notice of the areas in which we put housing in place so that services, employment, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1549"> all the other things that make up quality of life can be thought about and planned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that some members of the government must be aware of problems that have arisen all around Australia when public housing investment has occurred without good planning. There are many examples in Melbourne that I am very familiar with. We have in my own electorate of Jagajaga the Olympic Village. One of the major problems there has been long-term decay. I am very keen to see that area redeveloped in the context of the whole of the suburb so that we think about employment, education, and the opportunities that are available to people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the life of me, I cannot understand why you want to take out this part of the preamble. It is absolutely critical that $1 billion of Commonwealth funds for public housing is invested in the best interests of cities and towns. We do not want to see large housing estates on the fringes of our cities or in regional towns where there are no employment opportunities. That is absolutely contrary to the best interests of people who live in public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that it is yet again part of this government's attitude to better cities. It is not something that this government will take seriously. Once again, it will just try to hand this responsibility over to the states and local government and, of course, pay no regard to the environment in which tenants in public housing live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House are very committed to thinking about those issues, making sure that investment takes place that improves the quality of life of people in public housing, ensures that public housing is located close to employment and gives people the opportunities that they deserve. I commend the amendment to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not intend to oppose the cognate airports bills at this stage but does reserve its position for the future, depending on developments that occur with respect to the current controversy relating to the proposed second airport for Sydney to be constructed at Holsworthy. The legislation that has been introduced by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) is in large part the same as legislation introduced by the former Keating government, but there are some significant differences and, of course, the circumstances which provide the backdrop to the legislation are, as I adverted to, different as well. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the road and other infrastructure developments associated with the Badgerys Creek proposal should proceed where appropriate, regardless of whether Sydney West Airport is built at Badgerys Creek".</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make a number of points which relate to the provisions of this amendment. Firstly, the failure of the government to propose an approach to airport lease sales which involves selling Sydney airport in the first stage of the lease sale process will actually devalue the proceeds to the taxpayer as a result of the sale process. The Liberal and National parties blocked the sale process in the Senate last year, and it was subsequently estimated by BZW Australia that this would cost the taxpayer roughly $200 million in lost revenue from the sales process, because of the fact that Sydney was going to be removed from the initial sales and kept until last in the sale process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would concede that the absence of the cross&hyphen;ownership rules&mdash;which I will deal with at the consideration in detail stage and which were in our legislation but are not in the legislation before the House now&mdash;does reduce the impact in this regard, but still there is a significant problem with legislation for the sale of airport leases that provides for Sydney being held back. Selling the biggest and most substantial of the airports first would set a price in the market. It is clearly in the interests of anybody who is a seller in the market&mdash;in this case, the government and the taxpayer are&mdash;to set the highest price in that market, and that would necessitate selling Sydney in the first stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is possible that bidders for airports may hold back bids in the first tranche because they are more interested in holding Sydney rather than one of the other airports, or that they may put in lower bids or no bids at all. Alternatively&mdash;and both of these effects could occur&mdash;some bidders may face an invidious choice. They may want to own one airport <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lease, and they may want one of the top three or four, so they face a choice. Do they wait for Sydney, knowing that there is a risk that they may not get it; or do they potentially take what may be, in their terms, second best and bid for one of the cheaper ones, knowing that if they succeed in getting one of the cheaper airports&mdash;I am using the term `cheaper' advisedly, of course&mdash;they will not have enough money remaining to be able to afford to bid effectively for Sydney?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are quite a lot of distortions imported into the market as a result of the decision to not sell Sydney up&hyphen;front and to leave it towards the end&mdash;something which is not part of the legislation but which has effectively been indicated by the government and, because of the confusion now surrounding the future of Sydney West airport, something which is clearly unavoidable in the short term. In opposition, as I mentioned, the coalition delayed the sale of airport leases, purportedly in order to await the resolution of problems at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to compare the circumstances then with the circumstances now, because we have issues not yet resolved with respect to Kingsford Smith. Airservices Australia is in the process of doing a study with respect to flight paths, and is taking submissions. There is no proper community consultation, I might add. There are no community representatives on the committee that is involved with conducting the study, but that is not expected to be resolved until the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent changes that have been made with respect to flight paths, the reopening of the east-west runway and the like are too recent for any serious conclusions to be drawn about the impact of those changes. After some period of time obviously some conclusions could be drawn, but so far they are very recent and it is difficult to assess their impact at this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1553"> Secondly, the real solution to the problems of Kingsford Smith airport&mdash;namely, the construction of a second airport for Sydney&mdash;has now been put off due to some considerable confusion as a result of the proposal to conduct parallel EISs with respect to Hols worthy as well as Badgerys Creek. When we were in government, the coalition was saying, `Sorry, we can't sell the airport leases because KSA's problems are not resolved.' Now we are in a situation where things are even more blurry and more confused with respect to the solution to KSA's problems and it is saying, `We now want to sell the airport leases.' It is remarkable what a switch from opposition to government will do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in government there was no valid reason for delaying the sale process because the government's policy with respect to both Kingsford Smith airport and the second airport for Sydney was clear. It was straightforward and it was being acted upon. Now it is confused. Now we do not know where the second airport for Sydney will be or, indeed, if there will be one at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be delaying the sale of all airport leases, particularly Sydney's, until the EIS processes with respect to Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy are complete, until the government has made a decision as to which of these two, if any, it wants to make the site for Sydney's second airport and until the details of that airport&mdash;lengths of runways, curfews, sites of runways and various other issues&mdash;are determined. That would enable the government to sell the Sydney airport lease as part of the first tranche and, therefore, effectively set the market and remove the distortions in the market that I referred to. It would also leave much more certainty in the process with respect to the consideration of residents' concerns in the localities that are affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Minister for Transport and Regional Development is to be believed, all the EIS processes and the like will happen in this forthcoming financial year. Apparently the EIS processes will be finished by the end of this year. Maybe there is not a problem, if he is to be believed. But as they say in the ads: `I'd like to see that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 28 September last year when the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was the opposition leader, he said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Today</EMPHASIS> with respect to the coalition's blocking of the former Keating government's airport lease sale legislation:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Ralph Willis has said the fact that you defer the sale of something for a few months doesn't represent any fundamental undermining of the budgetary position. So all this talk about economic vandalism is just hyperbole.</PARA>
<PARA>Why can the current government, the Howard government, not defer its decisions, its actions, with respect to selling the airport leases for a period of time in order to allow the EIS processes to be completed, in order to allow the Sydney West airport controversy to be resolved and decisions made? It could then allow the sale of Sydney airport to be at the front end of the process and not at the rear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A delay would also allow us to clarify the situation with respect to Badgerys Creek, in particular some of the infrastructure proposals that are part of that proposed second airport for Sydney. I refer specifically to some of the road proposals which have enormous spin-off benefits for western Sydney above and beyond their relevance to the airport proposal. I would suggest, as does my second reading amendment, that these proposals should proceed in any event irrespective of the airport. I refer to such developments as the western Sydney orbital and upgrading Elizabeth Drive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economic modelling conducted for the former government indicated that the orbital road would cut transport costs for the community upwards of $870 million per annum and it would stimulate roughly $1.2 billion worth of extra economic activity for the western Sydney region. Clearly, some of the features of the Badgerys Creek proposal should be considered as stand&hyphen;alone items that should be financed and assisted by both federal and state governments. Some delay in the airport leasehold sale process would enable these issues to be dealt with properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, some form of delay would give us the opportunity to get to the bottom of this mystery about the Holsworthy proposal, the Holsworthy scam. We are gradually getting bits and pieces of the story. Bit by bit it is being dribbled out through question time and through statements in the media. Most of them are unintentional but bit by bit we are starting to piece the jigsaw together.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something called the Lawrence Hargrave project, and the people who represent that project had a meeting with various Liberal luminaries. It could have been in October 1994. Perhaps it was in July 1995. Perhaps there were two meetings. It is all a bit unclear. According to the Prime Minister, in October 1994 he attended a meeting with representatives of the Lawrence Hargrave project. He, as the shadow minister for industrial relations, did not actually tell us why he was attending such a meeting at the time. That is a bit hard to understand, but maybe he had some sort of vision. Maybe he is a clairvoyant and he knew that he was going to be the opposition leader shortly after that and Prime Minister shortly after that and, therefore, he had better come along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this meeting&mdash;whenever it occurred&mdash;we had the opposition leader or the industrial relations shadow minister, depending on when the time was; the shadow minister for transport; the shadow aviation minister; the shadow defence minister; and a number of other prominent Liberals who are yet to identify themselves. Their diaries must have been pretty clear. This was just a routine meeting&mdash;nothing special, nothing particularly important. It seems that they were just all available at the same time for just one of these hundreds of meetings putting forward different propositions about airports. We get them all the time, yet they had all of these key shadow ministers there. It is pretty surprising stuff really.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They did not tell anybody about it. Their excuse now is that it was all commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence, which seems a rather peculiar way to describe a meeting that was just another meeting out of hundreds of meetings. They could not even tell anybody that they actually met with some people and talked about the possibility of having Sydney's second airport, a major project, at Holsworthy. They could not tell anybody about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the former Minister for Transport and honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) explained today, when he was approached by these people there was no suggestion put to him that anything they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> might say to him would be commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence. He was not requested to keep all of this a secret and, quite clearly, he did not. If confidentiality was required, then logically there must have been some prospect of what was being proposed actually happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was pretty clear that under Labor what was being sought would not happen. The former government's policy was clear: it was going to build Badgerys Creek. It was committed to the proposal for Badgerys Creek to be Sydney's second airport. So there would be no need for confidentiality about that proposal being considered by the Labor minister. But when it comes to the Liberals, they say, `Oh, yes, we need confidentiality.' The only reason they needed confidentiality was that there was some prospect of it occurring. They needed to keep it a secret. They did not want people in electorates such as Hughes to know what they were thinking about, to know what they were considering, to know who they were talking about and to know what was being contemplated. They did not want people to know about it, so that is why there was a need for confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not expect that they are going to tell us the names of the people whom they were dealing with, the fine details of the proposal or how it was going to be financed. There is no reason at all why the fact that they were contemplating the proposition of a second Sydney airport&mdash;not at Badgerys Creek but at Holsworthy&mdash;had to be commercially confidential. It is just a nonsense proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How did it breach commercial confidentiality for the then Leader of the Opposition and the then shadow transport minister to say to the public, to the people of Hughes, to other people in western Sydney and south western Sydney, `We are contemplating a possibility of not proceeding with Badgerys Creek. We are contemplating Holsworthy as an alternative'? How does that breach commercial confidentiality? The answer, of course, is that it does not at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why was it a breach of commercial confidentiality for them to say those things in July of 1995 or October of 1994 but not in May of 1996? What had changed? What was so different? Why is it not a breach of commercial <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1555"> confidentiality for the minister for transport a week ago to come out and say, `We are now thinking about Holsworthy'? But to do that a year ago was a breach of commercial confidentiality. `Sorry, we can't tell you about it, but it is okay because now we can.' What has changed? There is only one thing that has changed: we have had an election in the meantime, and what was the opposition has become the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has changed and what is going on is pretty straightforward. Of course, the minister has suddenly discovered at the last minute that there are a few problems with Badgerys Creek. He has discovered that it is not flat. It is good to see that he is on top of his job. He has discovered that it is going to cost a bit of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, does anybody seriously expect that the minister, when he was shadow minister, was not aware of these issues&mdash;that he was not aware that there was a range of difficulties associated with building Badgerys Creek, as there would inevitably be various difficulties associated with building an airport of that magnitude pretty well anywhere? Again, what has changed? We have had an election. The opposition is now the government. The things that they wanted to keep under their hat while they were the opposition to make sure that they did not, for example, totally mess up their chances of winning electorates like Hughes and create further problems for themselves elsewhere in New South Wales&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has not taken this mob long to revert to type, has it?  They are the party of the fistful of dollars; they are the party of `We will keep Medibank'; and now they are the party of `We will build Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek'. It has not taken them long to revert to type. What has happened is that they have gone to the election with Badgerys. Even early after the election they were gung&hyphen;ho&mdash;`We are going to build Badgerys. No problem.' There was no concept discussed before the election with anybody&mdash;except with developers in secret&mdash;about building a second Sydney airport other than at Badgerys. There was no suggestion of Holsworthy. But after the election there was a sudden discovery of all these problems at Badgerys and that Holsworthy might not be such a bad idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the Holsworthy proposal in some detail. There are a few problems. There is a major koala colony in the way; there are ravines; there are nuclear reactors; there are sacred sites; there are shooting ranges for the Olympics; and so the list goes on. But, as I understand it, under the proposal from the Lawrence Hargrave project, these problems will cease to be the government's problems&mdash;they will become the developer's problems. And what will they get in return? Apparently, they will get Bankstown airport for 4,000 home sites&mdash;maybe more&mdash;and Australia's busiest will get closed. The government will give them Badgerys Creek as well, for maybe 15,000 home sites.</PARA>

Maybe you will get a small general aviation airport, but the end result will be a deal that the developers will do very nicely out of, and the government will be able to wash its hands of all responsibility. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing the government have not mentioned that is finally sinking in around the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1556"> place is that they are not actually proposing to build just an airport: it is going to be a theme park. Tourists will be able to go there and they will be able to cuddle the koalas, they will be able to watch the Olympics, they will be able to look at sacred sites, they will be able to have a tour of a nuclear reactor, they will be able to dice with death as they dance around the bombs on the runway and they will be able to battle their way through the 60-foot ravines&mdash;a theme park for thrill seekers! And they will not even have to leave the airport. They will not even need a visa. They will be able to do all this in one spot. It is an inspired suggestion, a spiv's delight, a developer's dream, and an absolutely inspired suggestion. We are going to have a theme park and an airport all in one spot. The only thing that is missing is a casino. Maybe if we got onto Hudson Conway and Felicity Kennett we could fix that one up, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some people around who think that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development is well known&mdash;that he is sharp. Well, I think he is. He is sharp, like Arthur Daly. He is the Arthur Daly of aviation. This operation has got Arthur Daly written all over it. Off he trundled with a few of the likely lads&mdash;Dave, Tezza and the boys. He went and had a chat with these people and thought, `Oh, this looks pretty good. A second&hyphen;hand airport. No problems. One previous owner. No rust. Just used by little old ladies flying the Cessna to church on Sunday. Looks like a great deal.' And the deal is done. Arthur comes away thinking he has done a pretty good job. All he has to do is keep it quiet, make sure that Inspector Chisholm does not get a look at it and make sure the  Australian people do not get a look at it. No problems. The deal is going to go through. That is a breeze. All he has to do is give the innocent look with the eyes cast down and say to the voters from Hughes, `No, we believe in Badgerys Creek, and as for Holsworthy we don't know anything about it at all.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then of course things start to go a bit awry. First, we get the unexploded bombs, then the sacred sites, then the Olympic range, planning problems, the Woronora catchment&mdash;and so the list goes on. I have left off half a dozen <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> things, and I am sure the list has not finished yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the killer&mdash;the key issue&mdash;is that there are thousands and thousands of people, including many young recent home buyers, who have bought houses there based on certain assumptions, including the very reasonable assumption that the newly elected government, for which many of them voted, was not going to suddenly impose an airport on them. This government said to them, `We are going to have it at Badgerys Creek.' Obviously, a fair proportion of these people voted for the government because it won in that particular electorate at least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister says that the delay is just an insurance policy. It is a pretty bizarre insurance policy. You start to wonder what the minister has for insurance on his house. Maybe it is a 4&hyphen;gallon drum of kero and a box of matches. I was a bit cynical last week but I realise that I was not sufficiently cynical. I would like to apologise to my colleagues for that. I will not do it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought that what was going on was only a delaying device, that the government did not want to build a second airport&mdash;it wanted to put it off, wanted to avoid spending the money, wanted to avoid doing anything&mdash;while through the back door it would increase capacity at KSA and get rid of the curfew. I still think that is a core part of the government's agenda but, obviously, there is a little bit of footsies with the spivs going on, a suggestion of, `Hey, we'll get something going at Holsworthy and who knows what might emerge.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House has before it a second reading amendment which I urge it to adopt. It suggests that we delay the sale of airport leases until all the facts come out about Holsworthy&mdash;the deals, the arrangements, the negotiations, the processes that will occur, whether Holsworthy is a serious option, whether the government is committed to it more than to Badgerys Creek. All these things are yet to leak out&mdash;although they are coming out in bits and pieces&mdash;and we believe that consideration of this bill and decisions on airport sales should be held over until these matters are resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extraordinary that the government, when in opposition, knocked over our legislation on airport sales in the Senate on the basis that there were question marks over resolving the noise problem at Kingsford Smith. Now, when there are still question marks over that issue and more, and much greater confusion about the ultimate solution to the problem&mdash;a second airport for Sydney&mdash;they say that we have to sell the airports. Isn't it amazing what the switch from opposition to government does? The opposition will not oppose the bill, as I indicated in the House, but it reserves the right to do so in the Senate, depending on what happens in the intervening period with some of the matters I have raised.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GK6">Miss JACKIE KELLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do. The major stumbling blocks to the previous legislation were the operation of the Sydney airport and the need for a comprehensive EIS on the second airport. The previous government's response to complaints to the closure of the east-west runway at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport was to fast&hyphen;track Badgerys Creek, build it at any expense&mdash;for goodness sake, get the airport up and running out at Badgerys Creek right over the top of everyone's interests and the interests of people in my electorate&mdash;even though the EIS that was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1558"> done on Badgerys Creek was 10 years old. The EIS had not considered flight paths and it had not considered noise pollution over residential areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out west we wondered if the then government thought we were deaf, because we were certainly concerned about flight paths. If people were concerned about the matter at Kingsford Smith, we were certainly concerned about it out west. This bill has reassured a number of people in Lindsay that this government does consider the quality of life of people who have to live with aircraft noise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that way this bill has honoured an election promise. Unlike the previous government, we honour our promises. We instigated a full, proper and open EIS with provision for a no result, which was not provided for under the previous government. In order to have a proper EIS done on Badgerys Creek, there must be provision to have a no result. If it comes up that the environmental impact of an airport of the size considered at Badgerys Creek would be so disruptive on the residents in that area that it should not proceed, then it should not proceed. That is all the government has done. It has made provision for a no result at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental provisions of the airports bill have been added to by the inclusion of the ability to establish regulations covering environmental standards on airports. The environmental impact of airports has become of notable concern and this government is responding to the community's concerns. We are providing significant penalties for breaches of those standards. These are in line with the government's already demonstrated commitment to lessening the environmental impact of aircraft operations on the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's environmental assessment processes will continue to apply to major airports regardless of the fact that the airport operator is a private lessee. The timetable for leasing the first stage airports depends on the necessary arrangements being put in place in advance of the leasing process. The first stage airports will be leased by July 1997, but only if the necessary legislation is passed by parliament without delay. It is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hoped that the opposition will support the leasing of these airports, as they did in government. The revenue from these leases is expected to provide a significant contribution to the budget proceeds in 1996-97, if timely passage of the bill is achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the Telstra privatisation, this is a healthy way for government to allow private citizens to participate in the ownership and control of the country's assets. Employees can buy a share in their workplace and can benefit from any increases in productivity that they may instigate. It is called motivation&mdash;motivation to increase your output, take pride in your work and do better each day because you are benefiting from it. Without this, organisations become a bottomless pit of ingrained corruption and dishonest practices, like the New South Wales state rail authority. Or should I attribute that to Barry O'Keefe? If there is the opportunity to have a share in your company, it should be grasped with both hands. If more Australians invested their savings for a deposit on a house in the share market, fewer Australian companies would be bought out by overseas concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the sale of Telstra and the leasing of these airports provide for limited foreign ownership, unlike the previous government's sale of Qantas. They provide for majority Australian ownership. In the case of the airports bills, there is a five per cent limit on airline or associated ownership. These ex&hyphen;government stocks are excellent investments for young couples&mdash;Telstra, the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas, Trans&hyphen;Australian Airlines, ANL, airport leases. The list goes on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP started it and we are just finishing it. Why do we have to finish the job? Government's role is to provide for areas where private enterprise cannot or will not work. Why can Australia not continue to invest in Australian companies? Because the Australian government currently owes $100 billion. The interest repayments on that alone are $10 billion a year.</PARA>

In the last three years we have increased our Commonwealth debt by over $40 billion. Do you know where the money comes from to pay for this debt? It comes from the taxpayer&mdash;PAYE tax, company tax, customs, and fines and levies on the Aussie battler. In the end, they have no more to give. Eventually, government must stop spending.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By our sale of these assets we will retire debt. By getting rid of that $100 billion debt, our interest payments go down and we have more funding for other areas of government spending such as defence, education and social security. Therefore, the sale of our assets should be supported in this instance because, unlike the previous government, we are actually retiring debt with our sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Airports Bill sets out a proposed regulatory regime. There are some key points to note about that. There is majority Australian ownership and a five per cent limit on airline or associate ownership. The Commonwealth retains control over land use, planning and building. This covers a point raised by the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) in that the Commonwealth will control building and land use&mdash;trust us on this one. The environmental requirements will be met&mdash;the government has already shown its commitment. There will be action&mdash;not just rhetoric&mdash;in terms of our environment and there will be financial transparency in the sale of these assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The modifications to our policy from last year's policy include access to airports for new entrants and other users. So it is spread right across all users. There is no need to defer the sale of other airports in other states waiting on the outcome of Kingsford Smith and Sydney West airports. We will also remove the cross&hyphen;ownership restrictions on the ownership of Sydney and Sydney West with either Melbourne or Brisbane airports. That is crucial to the fundamental principles of private enterprise.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also ensure that the Commonwealth controls with regard to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the Sydney Airport Curfew Act, the Air Navigation Act, the Air Services Act, the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and any other policy arrangements implemented by government will be complied with by the lessees. We will not allow the lessee of Sydney airport to undertake any major infrastructure developments that would increase the runway capacity of the airport, nor will we allow the lessee of the Sydney airport to undertake developments that will prevent the full use of the east&hyphen;west runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not lease the Sydney airport or the Sydney West airport until all environmental issues currently being discussed are resolved. That way we can hand on a financially viable and strong organisation to a private company to take over its management. The coalition will set an X value for the Sydney airport and the Sydney West airport so that the charges at Sydney West airport are lower than the ones at Sydney. This will give airlines an incentive to use the new airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to a number of points made by the member for Melbourne, he stated that the ALP's policy for Kingsford Smith airport and the Sydney West airport was clear. It was abundantly clear in Lindsay where I got a 12 per cent swing. It was abundantly clear that they were going to build Badgerys Creek come hell or high water. Disregarding what the metropolitan air quality survey said, Sydney West airport was going to go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to his suggestion that we should defer the process, defer the process of returning some funding to government coffers to reduce the amount of interest we are paying each year so that further money is available for public expenditure. He would defer the process past June&hyphen;July, so the economic situation would continue to worsen and Beazley's black hole would get bigger and bigger. In the meantime, we would be trying to get these sales through so we could harness our debt and reduce our interest payments. That is why it is important for the sales to proceed as suggested in this legislation. We will clarify the environmental situation at <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1560"> Kingsford Smith and Sydney West airports before the sales of those airports go through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn my attention now to the amendments suggested by the member for Melbourne. I will address the first amendment on why the sales should not be delayed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> I was discussing the Sydney west orbital link. Without the increased road traffic from Elizabeth Drive to the Hume Highway, there is no requirement to upgrade the Elizabeth Drive link of the Sydney west orbital.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the representations made by the Lawrence Hargrave project, the opposition has made much of this, but they will not listen to the Hargrave project. It is only after strong representations on behalf of our electorate from people like me, Kerry Bartlett and John Fahey that our government listened. They have come up with an alternative, an insurance policy, in case the EIS on Badgerys Creek comes up negative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will make much of this, yet the Lawrence Hargrave project approached the opposition. They actually discussed it with the opposition, yet they will do nothing because they were committed to an airport at Badgerys Creek, come what may.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for their attack on Kennett, broken promises and cronyisms, let me mention just two words&mdash;Bob Carr.

They want to hold over the sale yet again. It has been held over since 1985. If they had taken action in 1985 when the site was first proposed, we would not be in the predicament that we are in now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the enormous residential development that has gone on down the M4 and the M5, the site at Badgerys Creek is considerably different from what it was in 1985. All that we are asking&mdash;and all that Kerry Bartlett, John Fahey and I request&mdash;is that another EIS, a proper and open EIS, is done on the Badgerys Creek site. If the results are negative, we request that provision be made for an alternative site. Be it at Holsworthy, Wilton, Newcastle or wherever, it will be over people's heads.</PARA>

A government that is prepared to listen to projects such as Lawrence Hargrave, Wilton, Newcastle or any other project and a government that is prepared to talk to people, turn to public consultation and listen I put my money on to come up with a better solution than anecdotal evidence seems to suggest Badgerys Creek will produce.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with great interest to a lot of what the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) had to say. I was very amused to hear that she and the government generally were prepared to listen. A public meeting was held in my electorate in the last week of the last election campaign. I was assured by the Penrith anti-airport association, PAAAN, that the member for Lindsay would be a candidate and speaker at that meeting. But I arrived at that meeting and suddenly discovered that the honourable member for Lindsay, who was then the candidate for Lindsay, was not there and that in fact Senator Woods had taken her place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lindsay would know that it is grossly untrue to say that we were not going to undertake an EIS. I am in this House as an original advocate of Badgerys Creek airport. I do not resile from that. I do recognise that people became very concerned about its impact. I welcomed that EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the government living up to its promises, where are the guidelines that were promised on 1 May? You extended, quite rightly, public submissions for those guidelines for Badgerys Creek, but where are they? What this amendment does for the honourable member for Lindsay and her constituents is to ensure that there will be no sale of Sydney airport or any other airport until such time as the EIS for Badgerys Creek is completed. Does she not care about that? Does she believe that it is appropriate to sell Sydney before that EIS is completed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Lindsay made much of this new proposition, this so-called fall&hyphen;back of Holsworthy. I would like to know when that decision was made. Was it made before the election, or was it made after the election? I invite the honourable member for Lindsay to come clean. She has put out a press release, as has the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett), claiming credit for having put Holsworthy as a stand&hyphen;by site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who is right and who is wrong? Was this something that was deeply embedded by the opposition prior to the election? I believe it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1562"> was. I believe that the electors of Lindsay were deceived by not being informed by Senator Bob Woods when he was at the meeting in my electorate in the last week of the campaign and by the honourable member for Lindsay when she was campaigning on this issue. Why did they not announce it to the people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we all know that it has come as a shock to the honourable member for Hughes (Mrs Vale). I ask: why is it that the Liberal Party, in a period of adverse polling, is not running a candidate in the by-election for Blaxland? It is for one reason only: Bankstown airport is being closed, and the people of Bankstown know that if Holsworthy goes ahead and Bankstown is closed they are going to cop airport noise. That is the reason. I am standing here to support what I think are some essential elements for the people of western Sydney&mdash;whether they live in Lindsay, in my electorate of Chifley or Parramatta&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no point of order. The debate has been broad ranging and the reality is that it is about the sale of airports. In terms of the broad debate right around Australia with regard to the sales of airports, the issues which are being canvassed by the member for Chifley are relevant and appropriate. I call the honourable member for Chifley.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I was saying, I rise here tonight to speak on behalf of the people of western Sydney. Why is that so offensive to the honourable member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn)? Why does he raise a frivolous point <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of order on me? The people of Lindsay, Chifley&mdash;my own electorate&mdash;Hughes, Werriwa or wherever they may reside in western Sydney need to know what is going to happen with the EISs and that they will not be gazumped on the EISs. I would have thought that that was a very clear message&mdash;an outcome from the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By moving this amendment the ALP, the Labor opposition, is trying to ensure that no sale will proceed until these EIS processes are concluded. The other point is that we were promised infrastructure in Badgerys Creek&mdash;important infrastructure. I reject totally what the member for Lindsay says, that that infrastructure is solely dependent on the airport. Of course, western Sydney is growing and, of course, our links across the region have been poor historically&mdash;and there are over $400 million worth of infrastructure proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we need some commitment from the government&mdash;and that is again why I support this amendment&mdash;that the people of western Sydney will not be diddled out of that infrastructure. This is what the amendment is saying. The people of Lindsay, Chifley or wherever will not be diddled out of that infrastructure that the honourable member for Lindsay is on record as saying is so unnecessary and is only dependent on the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Holsworthy, let me make a few observations. Who really believes that the government, should Holsworthy become a viable alternative because Badgerys Creek fails the EIS, can commence construction in a very short order of time? Firstly, there will be the problem that the defence department has to select a site. So it has to go through a process of site selection to relocate&mdash;as, Mr Speaker, you would well understand. You then have to do an EIS on the new site to look at the impact of it and you have to consult locally, and that is at least 18 months to two years of activity. Then you have to construct the new facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do we really imagine that we are going to be able to warehouse those units at some other point? Of course not. Holsworthy is all about deferring the spending of the moneys that would be derived from the sale of these existing airports and their being absorbed into <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1563"> consolidated revenue. I defy any member of the government to run a logical argument about timing in respect of Holsworthy to show that you can get Holsworthy up as quickly as Badgerys Creek. That is absolute bunkum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite the honourable member for Lindsay, in relation to the infrastructure proposals, to please contact Penrith City Council and see whether they share her views that this added infrastructure for the western suburbs of Sydney is totally unnecessary if Badgerys Creek does not go ahead. Ask Penrith City Council whether they would like to see that infrastructure provided, as this amendment provides. Ask them whether Penrith City Council would like you to vote for a mechanism, an amendment, that would indeed guarantee people who live in our part of the world that they will get this infrastructure that was proposed in relation to the construction of Badgerys Creek. I know what the answer will be. But it is good not to take advice only from one source. Contact the Western Suburbs Regional Organisation of Councils. WESROC will take a regional view. They perhaps will not be as parochial as Penrith. Ask them how they feel about ensuring that this infrastructure should be provided for constituents in Lindsay and other western suburbs electorates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you do not trust the local government level, ask the Western Suburbs Economic Development Board. That is basically a board that was appointed under the previous Liberal government, so presumably they are not necessarily friends of this side of the House. Ask them what they think about the impact on the western suburbs of Sydney of not having Badgerys Creek and not having that infrastructure that goes with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret that, generous as government members may be, they are not going to give me an extension of time, as they did for the honourable member for Lindsay, so I want to go over again why I and other members from the western suburbs of Sydney are supporting this amendment. We are saying that there should be no sale. We are making a commitment to the people of western Sydney. Unlike the member for Lindsay and, I presume, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) and, I presume, the member for Macquarie, we are making a firm commitment to the people of western Sydney that no sale should occur until these EIS processes are completed. We note, as the member for Lindsay did not note in her address, that the guidelines have not been tabled. They were due on the first of this month and they have not been produced. Already the promised timetable has slipped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this side of the House we believe that western Sydney deserves the added road infrastructure that was promised by the previous government. We seek assurances on behalf of the people in the western suburbs of Sydney, the small businesses in the western suburbs of Sydney and indeed the big businesses of the western suburbs of Sydney&mdash;we want that infrastructure there whether Badgerys Creek goes ahead or doesn't go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just in case the honourable member for Lindsay or the honourable member for Parramatta or the honourable member for Macquarie do not contact Penrith council or do not contact WESROC or do not contact the economic development board, I undertake in this place to do that. I undertake to do that so that I will be able to report back in very clear, unequivocal language&mdash;yes or no&mdash;what they came down in favour of. Are they in favour of these EISs and no sale going ahead before the EIS processes are completed? Are they in favour of this infrastructure or are they willing and happy to give it up? I fear I already know the answer, but process is everything and I will make the effort. Just in case the honourable member for Lindsay might get an engaged signal and might find it difficult to speak to someone, I undertake to the House and to all honourable members that I will make these inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1564"> But then I will expect the honourable member for Lindsay, the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Macquarie to stand up for the interests of the electors who elected them at the last election. Should this come to a vote, I will expect them to side with us and side with the voters who put them in. The honourable member for Lindsay is right: they are concerned about noise. They do want to see the EIS com pleted. They do want to see a transparent process. And it is quite true that I welcome&mdash;if we could ever get the guidelines released&mdash;the no&hyphen;go provision in Badgerys Creek EIS. But we do not want to be diddled. We do not want a sale ahead of these EIS processes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to raise my concerns with respect to an apparent and quite serious breach of the ministerial guidelines set down by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in relation to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and his maritime adviser, Mr Greg Bondar. Mr Bondar was formerly the CEO of the Australian Chamber of Shipping, which is the organisation which represents foreign shippers in Australia. His appointment with the minister commenced on 15 May this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minutes from the technical section of the Australian Chamber of Shipping of 1 May referred to the resignation of Mr Bondar from that organisation and his commencement with Mr Sharp on 15 May. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Bondar had agreed to provide support and advice to the new CEO for some time.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words `for some time'. I mentioned this concern briefly in a speech in this place. The office of the minister provided me with several documents to suggest there was actually nothing wrong with the appointment and that everything was in order. Amazingly enough, one of them, a letter from Mr Bondar to Mr A. Drescher, Managing Director of Columbus Overseas Services Pty Ltd, dated 6 May, is yet another indication that he is still doing two jobs. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given my commitment to the chamber and its objectives, I will make myself available should members have any issues of concern they wish to raise with me in my new position.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only has Mr Sharp appointed a representative of foreign shippers as his shipping <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adviser but also he is allowing Mr Bondar to continue providing advice and assistance to his former employer&mdash;the Australian Chamber of Shipping. This is a clear breach of Mr Howard's guidelines on ministerial conduct, which states on page 21:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of staff should not contribute to the activities of interest groups or bodies involved in lobbying the government, if there is any possibility that a conflict of interest or the appearance of such a conflict may arise.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Sharp should instruct Mr Bondar to sever fully his connections with the ACS and to provide balanced advice on the future of the Australian shipping industry. It is hardly surprising that Mr Sharp is attempting to remove all assistance to the Australian shipping industry when his chief adviser on shipping is still directly connected with foreign shipping interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the Prime Minister is in the chamber. I call on the Prime Minister to look into this matter because it is quite clear that there is a conflict of interest currently within the office of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. There is somebody who is continuing to function as a representative of the Australian Chamber of Shipping and as a representative of foreign shipping interests in Australia and providing advice on maritime issues to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise here this evening to raise a matter that concerns me greatly. I have been dismayed to learn women's boxing is being promoted in Queensland as the latest thrill sport. This must be mankind's most diabolical sport when you consider the aim of the game is to inflict as many blows to the head as is necessary to render the opponent senseless. As we well know, this is not always a temporary condition and the term `punch drunk' is just a frivolous way of saying `brain damaged'. To think that we are now encouraging young women, many of them not yet 20 years of age, into a ring to have their brains and bodies scrambled, most certainly with lasting consequences!</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1565">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been told that women's boxing in Australia is officially almost non-existent. Mr Speaker, I can assure you that this is not true. We have already celebrated the Queensland Amateur Boxing League's Women's Welterweight Boxing Titles, and some of these young female boxers are being groomed for international bouts. A published photograph of one recent event showed the champion, Sharon `She Devil' Smith, being hit fair and square on the side of the head by Kristy-Lee `Kiss of Death' Mott. Sharon has not yet celebrated her 20th birthday, yet her face, frozen by the camera shutter at the moment of impact, looked distorted and bizarre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Locals in the towns around Toowoomba, north-west of Brisbane, will tell you that the area is fight crazy. Others boast that this first batch of female boxers are being born and bred there. Most are still at school. Kristy Mott is just 16 and already travelling 100 kilometres three times a week to train with Doug Talbot, a former Jimmy Sharman fighter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The redoubtable Jimmy Sharman will be known to more senior members of the House as the showground spruiker who travelled Australia with a troupe of professional and amateur boxers. Many a wide-eyed youngster was lured into the ring to take on one of Sharman's fighters for a handful of dollars&mdash;I suppose we could probably say that they were pounds in those days. Doug's legacy of his years with Jimmy Sharman is no teeth and a body full of broken bones. Now he is planning to train young Kristy Mott so that she can compete in the state titles and then the Australian titles before he launches her onto the international boxing circuit. He predicts she will be ready in her early 20s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have so many boxing icons to look up to, don't we? There is the great Muhammed Ali, for example. He is a man who for many years was the epitome of grace and speed in the ring. Now he is not quite the man he was. To see that we are encouraging young girls who are just maturing as young women to take on this obscene sport is appalling. I call on this parliament to take urgent steps to see that not just young women but all women are barred from professional boxing.</PARA>

I am contacted daily by phone, by people in the street and by correspondence from residents who are expressing their concerns about the environmental impact of this proposed airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> dated 21 May 1996 adds to residents' concerns. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1985 EIS report disregarded concerns for regional air quality, suggesting that an airport would increase air emissions&mdash;nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide&mdash;by between 0.5% and 2.1%. Total emissions would remain below levels reached in the inner city. But CSIRO research has since shown that ozone levels recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council is ineffective in dispelling pollutants.</PARA>
<PARA>Following representations from the Blacktown Committee Against Airport Noise, I made representations to the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency seeking funding for community groups making submissions to the EIS. If community groups are to be in a position to influence EIS findings, they need to have access to consultants and technical information to prepare detailed submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a week is a long time in politics, 11 years is an eternity when siting airports. Major changes have taken place since the 1985 environmental impact statement into Badgerys Creek. I again refer to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article by Linda Morris of 21 May about the 1985 EIS. In part, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Badgerys Creek was an outpost of Sydney, located in a semi-rural patch that was a mix of poultry farms, market gardens, hobby farms and horse studs. The draft environment impact statement found that with a north-east/south-west runway alignment, fewer than 2000 people would be affected by aircraft noise.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Further, recent decisions by the incoming coalition government have added to residents' concerns. These concerns are the widening of the terms of the Badgerys Creek EIS so as to consider this airport as Sydney's major inter <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1566"> national airport, extending the length of the runway from 2,900 metres to 4,000 metres and determining that Badgerys Creek airport, if built, would be a 24&hyphen;hour operation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The anti&hyphen;airport noise campaign in the inner city has also been very influential in forming public opinion against Badgerys Creek airport as people in the west do not want the same noise problems that have been experienced in the inner city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further influencing factor concerning this airport is that five more residential developments are being built within a five&hyphen;kilometre radius of the airport site. I believe that for an airport to be built anywhere in the metropolitan area the public needs to be overwhelmingly convinced of two major points: firstly, that there would be no adverse environmental impact on the residents of surrounding areas and, secondly, that there would be massive employment opportunities arising out of the construction and operation of the airport. The public of western Sydney has not yet been convinced in any way on either of these two points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat my call to the federal government for funding for local communities to enable them to prepare their submissions for the EIS and its recommendations. I support the thrust of the arguments by the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) and her suggestion that Goulburn warrants a serious examination as the second airport in association with the fast train system.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

Many Italians are on the Australian electoral roll, and those who do not speak English well may need some assistance with voting at election time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a wonderful committee which has provided wide-ranging support to the Italian community and to the general community on the Sunshine Coast for the last 11 years. The committee has, however, been disadvantaged by the actions of the former Goss Labor government in Queensland. The funding for teaching of Italian comes partly from a Commonwealth government grant channelled through the Queensland Department of Education and partly from the Italian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, the Goss Labor government created a new body known as LACU&mdash;the Languages and Cultures Unit&mdash;and reallocated a lot of money from the Italian School Committee, where it was being used to teach Italian, into administration. This means that only some six Italian teachers are now provided from federal funding and over 20 other teachers are provided by the Italian School Committee as a result of local fundraising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight in the House I call on the new state government of Queensland to restore the funding to the Italian School Committee. Apparently at the present time the same amount of money is being allocated but, regrettably, only a tiny proportion of that money is finding its way to the purpose for which it is allocated. The Italian School Committee could do with the money that is currently being squandered in administration by the Queensland government's Languages and Cultures Unit.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1567">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly pleased to hear that the Queensland education minister has agreed to see Mrs Gabriella Matacchioni in the very near future. I am confident that the Queensland government will recognise the important work of the Italian School Committee over the last 11 years. I am also confident that the Queensland government will restore the funding that was so wrongfully taken from the committee by the Goss Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an area like the Sunshine Coast it is important to encourage the teaching of languages other than English. The Italian School Committee has done a wonderful job, and if the moneys taken away from it were to be restored the Italian School Committee could do an even better job in the future.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<ELECTORATE> (Werriwa)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.46 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Monday week I listened with great interest when the new member for Cook (Mr Mutch) explained some of his family history to the House. I was extremely interested to hear that in 1934 his great&hyphen;uncle, Tom Mutch, contested the federal seat of Werriwa as a UAP candidate. The member for Cook went on to say that, in his assessment, the ALP ratted on a good man in Tom Mutch and that he was going to repay this debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am interested in all the history of the fascinating seat of Werriwa, which I am privileged to represent in this House, so I went to the history books to do a little bit of research. These issues will fascinate and interest the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), who is present in the chamber, because he has a similar history, although he did not enter the parliament as an ALP member as Tom Mutch did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of the matter is that Tom Mutch was a minister in the Lang government in the late 1920s but he fell out with Lang. If you were in the Labor party in New South Wales at the end of the 1920s and you had not fallen out with Lang, there was something funny.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's right. If you had not fallen out with Jack Lang at the end of the 1920s it would have been absolutely extraordinary. That was no reason to leave the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor Party and seek membership with the United Australia Party. That was no reason to be upset with politics in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Tom Mutch had been loyal to the cause of Labor, loyal to his fundamental beliefs in politics, he would have joined with a good man like Ben Chifley to fight Lang. He would have joined with Ben Chifley when he came to Sydney and ran against Lang in the state division of Auburn in the mid&hyphen;1930s. There was every reason&mdash;what with the factions, the politics and divisions in the New South Wales Labor party in the 1920s&mdash;to find a side that would fight Lang for you, such as Chifley's official New South Wales Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I totally reject the assertion that the Labor party did anything wrong to Tom Mutch. Mutch left the Labor Party at the end of the 1920s because he had fallen out with Lang! Everyone fell out with Lang but not everyone left. Some joined with Ben Chifley and continued to fight for the things they believed in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fascinating thing to look at the conservative side of politics and at what actually happened in the division of Werriwa in 1934. Quite remarkably, between 1931 and 1934 the seat was held by Walter Ramsay McNicoll, David McNicoll's father, who at the time was the Principal of the Presbyterian Ladies College at Goulburn. McNicoll did not get the chance to contest the election against Lazzarini in 1934 because he must have been knocked off by Tom Mutch for the UAP pre&hyphen;selection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Mutch has a fairly nefarious background in these matters. Once he left the Labor Party, for no good reason, he became a Labor rat; he deserted the Labor cause. Once he did that, he must have knocked off the sitting member&mdash;again, the member for Bradfield would relate to these things&mdash;in the seat of Werriwa and, in turn, unsuccessfully contested that seat against Bert Lazzarini, who went on to hold the seat with great distinction from 1934 to 1952, serving as a minister in the Chifley government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mutches have no cause for complaint. These were things in their own hands. They were masters of their own destiny. Tom Mutch could have joined the fight with Chifley against Lang, or joined any one of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1568"> many factions that were disputing those issues in the New South Wales Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with interest that Mutch returned to local government in the 1930s. He contested a by&hyphen;election for the state seat of Coogee in June 1938, which he won, having earlier been unsuccessful in contesting the seat of Bathurst. So this fellow was a bit of a carpetbagger&mdash;and again, the member for Bradfield, who moved from Tasmania to Sydney, would relate to this. Mutch tried Werriwa, which then took in the south&hyphen;west of New South Wales, tried the state seat of Bathurst in the beginning of 1938 and then in June of that year ended up in Coogee. Talk about a travelling minstrel show! Talk about a carpetbagger!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Mutches have little cause for complaint in the history of these things. The new member for Cook should accept the history that I have placed on the parliamentary record and accept that he has no gripe with the Australian Labor Party. If he has a gripe he should look through the family history and give the House a full account of his great&hyphen;uncle's folly in leaving the Australian Labor Party, ratting on the Australian Labor Party. He has no gripe and should rest those things easily, rest those things happily, in the Mutch family archives.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I first congratulate the member for Griffith (Mr McDougall) on a very esteemed appointment as secretary of the Malaysia Friendship Association, and I do wish him well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice in the House there has been a lot of debate about Sydney's proposal for Badgerys Creek and for Holsworthy, but there is another airport that is of closer interest to my heart&mdash;Coolangatta airport. It is Australia's sixth busiest airport, on the border of New South Wales and Queensland&mdash;Tweed Heads and Coolangatta. This is another airport facing critical testing when it comes to aircraft noise and the balance that has to be achieved by fostering a critical tourism industry for that area&mdash;the Gold Coast and Northern Rivers&mdash;and also trying to rectify the noise issue <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which has now permeated the Tweed Heads area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Coolangatta airport is the closest airport to any GPO in Australia, being three kilometres away. Indeed, over 25,000 people in New South Wales are directly affected by being under the flight paths. I would like to explain to the House that the government is taking a number of measures to ascertain the level of aircraft noise, and this will be used as a blueprint to establish ANEF zones and ANEFCs for Tweed Heads and also for Currumbin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Airservices Australia has three noise monitoring devices currently in place now. These will be used to facilitate and audit. From the audit that will be complete halfway through this year, new contour lines will be drawn and obviously new flight paths will be established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems is that the previous Minister for Transport, who has gained quite a lot of notoriety in this House in the last couple of months, deliberately altered flight paths&mdash;it was with his full knowledge&mdash;which caused unnecessary concern to many residents in the Tweed Heads area. That is why we have a substantial noise problem which came about by the direction of the member whom I have replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of critical issues with this airport that need to be addressed. I would certainly like the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to come to Coolangatta at the closest opportunity to look at the implementation of a limited curfew and to look at perhaps putting pressure on some particular operators&mdash;turbo props coming in the middle of the night, notably the paper plane, which does concern a lot of residents directly under the flight path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Great consideration also needs to be given to whether Coolangatta airport should have a runway extension, which would really be the precursor for internationalisation. Whilst our airport is critical for domestic traffic and also New Zealand traffic, great care and consideration needs to be given if it is to be an international airport because of the added pressure that wide&hyphen;bodied aircrafts would place on the residents of Tweed Heads and Currumbin.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1569">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I ask that Airservices provide all the information to relevant interest groups within the Tweed Heads area, namely, the noise action group comprising Jim Boydell, Rupt Granot and Ronnie Hoskinson in cooperation with the FAC, of which Maurie Rowe is the chairman. It is a critical airport. For the future of our electorate and Northern Rivers, getting the right balance between the residents and the future growth in tourism is of key importance.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Legal Aid</TITLE>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SK6">Mr TONY SMITH</NAME>
<ELECTORATE> (Dickson)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.55 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in relation to legal aid. Last August there was a great fanfare in Dickson. The former Prime Minister and the former member for Dickson descended on the electorate of Dickson with great fanfare and the `Justice for all' statement was launched. Anyone who was in practice, especially those who practised in legal aid areas, as I did, knew that it was the greatest farce one had ever seen in one's life. `Justice for all' was anything but justice for all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former member for Dickson spoke of the need to have a system whereby lawyers did speculative work. The implication was that lawyers ought to be made to do speculative work. I think he said that from now on lawyers would be made to do speculative work. I practised in the speculative area a great deal. In fact, for the last couple of years my practice would have been of the order of 70 per cent speculative work. That came about because so many people could not get legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frequently one had to advise the people with the tough case: `Look, you've got a difficult case. I think you've got some prospect, but it is a very difficult case.' Inevitably, that sort of advice to the legal aid office was the kiss of death for people seeking redress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can think of one particular example during that last 12 months. A lady came to me seeking my advice in relation to the death of her husband in a hospital on the north coast. I was involved in the inquest related to that case. She came to seek my advice as to whether or not an action existed under Lord Campbell's act for the wrongful death of her <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> husband. I looked at the matter in as quick a fashion as I could because Legal Aid was not prepared to fund such an advice. Legal Aid said, `You give us an advice and we will make a decision.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inevitably in a case like that my advice would have been, `It will be a very difficult case; however, it is a matter that should proceed.' I knew what Legal Aid's response would have been. They would have said, `No way in the world will we fund it.' The next question would be whether or not counsel would be able to spec the case. In other words, they would take the case on and if the case was successful&mdash;that means if damages were recovered&mdash;the barrister and solicitors would be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That particular proposition seems attractive on its face, but it inevitably is not attractive. Those sorts of cases would be taken on sometimes. Because of the absolute starvation on legal aid it has tended to happen more and more in recent years. Invariably, it was not the hard cases that were taken on. The cases that were taken on were ones where some reasonable prospects of success were envisaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would come close to the time when the court proceedings were coming to a head. Invariably delays would have preceded that, sometimes of the order of eight to 10 years, and the cost would be enormous. The out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket situation for the solicitor and frequently counsel was also enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would get to the situation where the workers compensation board, more so than the compulsory third party insurers, I might say, would put the proposition of a settlement to counsel and solicitors acting for the plaintiff. Counsel and solicitors were put in that awful situation where frequently a very ordinary settlement was offered. The one thing counsel and solicitors had in front of them <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1570"> was the chance of getting paid for eight to 10 years work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a good situation for counsel and solicitors to be placed in. That is why I suggest that we must look at that and perhaps create a fund, tax the fund&mdash;tax funds that are recovered&mdash;and have a fund held in trust so that an ongoing system can be provided to help people with those hard cases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first opportunity I have had to speak in the Main Committee, and a strange experience it is. I am sure, however, that I will get used to it. I have pleasure in joining with my colleagues in the opposition to speak on the supply bills, in whatever forum, because the debate about the supply bills gives us a chance to outline what might have been and a chance to expose a contrast. Of course, the money we are appropriating in these bills is five&hyphen;twelfths of what the forward estimates suggested for the program of the previous Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It shows evidence of a lean and very vigorously targeted public sector and, in fact, a public sector which is the third most lean in the OECD. There are few more rigorously targeted and rigorously pruned public sectors that are still focused on social outcomes anywhere in the world. It is pointless to get into debate about which public sector is the best, but it is a good public sector, an efficient public sector, a targeted public sector and it is one where the expenditure is focused on achieving social outcomes. It makes a stark contrast with what we see emerging in the public debate, what we see announced as public policy, and what we fear is in prospect by way of announcements from the government parties in opposition and leaks and announcements from them since they have been in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk in a moment about the consequence of some of the cuts, but what concerns me are these untargeted, across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board cuts. There seems to be no picture of the sort of public sector we are looking for or the sort of public sector we will have at the end of this project of cuts, or at the end of the project which is coming next&mdash;the Commission of Audit&mdash;or after this budget and perhaps the next.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just a question of what public sector employment will look like, although, of course, that is very important to many Australians. There seems to be no strategy concerning the services which will be cut or the services which will remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was, before the election, some sort of myth being perpetrated by the then opposition that somehow or other the cuts of the sort that were being envisaged could be made from trimming a little bit of waste and targeting public sector employment and salaries.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1571">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer (Mr Gareth Evans), has outlined, sufficiently comprehensively so that it needs no reiteration, the fact that the $8 billion target&mdash;the so&hyphen;called black hole&mdash;is a fiction. Cuts of that level are not needed. But, for whatever reason, this government has set itself a target of $8 billion worth of cuts. One thing is arithmetically unavoidable: there can be no $8 billion worth of cuts from salaries as the public sector salary budget is only $1.5 billion. If the Commonwealth wound up employing nobody, the only reason it would save more money is that there would be nobody to send out the cheques and provide the services. The salary budget itself cannot solve this problem that the government has created for itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the very intriguing questions about this very convenient figure of $8 billion is that the new figures that came out yesterday&mdash;from reading the media releases on the AAP wire&mdash;show changed economic growth performance. The figures makes it clear that in relation to the $8 billion figure&mdash;even on the basis of the government's calculations, even on the premise that led them to that faulty conclusion&mdash;the gap is narrowing. We wonder whether we are going to get the $8 billion worth of cuts, anyway, even if that should generate a surplus. The growth figures are more encouraging and the deficit is less than that projected, even on the government's figuring. We wonder whether the $8 billion figure is set in stone or whether the government will be flexible. We also wonder whether the government will be able to wave a magic wand and produce a balanced budget, without the stringent cuts that are currently being proposed, and about which speculation is being engendered and sometimes, I think, encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem that concerns me is not that broader macro-economic question; that is profound and important but it is one that is being debated by others. I am concerned about two related questions. One is that many of the cuts are being made where the services are needed most, and the other is the related question of what it says about a strategy for Australia and the Australian economy. If you have a vision of what a modern Australian economy might look like, it would seem to me inevitably to have three key features: a commitment to high technology, manufacturing and services; a commitment to an engagement with Asia; and a commitment to a skilled work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what are we seeing? We are seeing in the area of high technology dramatic proposals for cuts to research and development. I still have the hope that they will not eventuate but they are certainly in prospect. We see cuts to the capacity of Australian society to generate new ideas by the vandalism being proposed to the university sector by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone). With respect to the information technology industry, there is a proposal that there be a $1 billion cut in the purchase of IT equipment and services by the Commonwealth. The information technology industry is expressing concern about the implications of the changes proposed to the export market development grants scheme and its very ambitious, but achievable, export targets by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the areas of great pride for me, as Minister for Trade, was the progress we were able to make in developing and implementing a strategy to improve our exports of high technology goods and services, and in the development of the IT &amp; T sector&mdash;information technology and telecommunications. Those industries set themselves ambitious targets and they were well on the road to achieving them. Four of the elements vital to their success include: government support for research and development; government support for the tertiary education sector and its research and development function; government support for the information technology <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1572"> industry through its procurement policy; and government support for export for that sector through export market development grants. However, the attacks on those four combine to suggest that the government has no faith in the capacity of Australia to be a successful economy in the production of high technology goods and services. If that is the case, we cannot be a successful country in providing challenging jobs for the young people we are training in our universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in the high technology part of any strategy, we see failure and withdrawal. In the commitment to Asia, every program that underpins our engagement with Asia is under threat. We have already seen the end to the DIFF scheme&mdash;the development import finance facility scheme is gone&mdash;with protests from our neighbours around the region about its implications for them, for projects which they have set as a priority and on which they have spent money on the basis of indications from the Australian government that soft loans under the DIFF scheme would be forthcoming. But that scheme has gone, and you can see employees in factories and offices all around Australia whose jobs are under threat as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The export market development grants scheme is under threat. It is the most reviewed scheme of which I am aware in the Commonwealth public sector, each review saying that it is a cost&hyphen;effective scheme that generates exports and jobs far in excess of the expenditure which it incurs. We have the Asia infrastructure consortium program just starting to have effect in getting the Australian construction and related industries involved in the infrastructure boom of our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trillions of dollars of expenditure, of investment, will be forthcoming in the next decade in this region in infrastructure and Australian companies can compete successfully. But they do not have the critical mass to win the big contracts by themselves and it is very expensive to put together a consortium to bid. So they need a bit of assistance to get into the bidding business. If they win, the money comes back to the government. We already had some grants under that scheme. It was showing signs of good prospects in Indonesia and China, and we see that under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see export access, the small business assistance scheme for exports run by the industry associations, under threat. Most amazingly of all, reports have come to me that ITES&mdash;the international trade enhancement scheme&mdash;is under threat. If that is the case that is ideology gone mad, because that is a scheme that essentially has almost no impact on public sector outlays any longer because it is a revolving fund. As the money comes back from the successful grant and loan recipients it flows out to the next round of grant recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the last forward estimates that I recall, certainly within the forward estimate period, it was estimated that appropriations required to maintain the ITES scheme would fall to zero. I cannot say&mdash;because the information was not sufficiently up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date when I ceased to be the minister to make it possible&mdash;that we were going to achieve that target absolutely. But there was no doubt that the outlays were declining and that the cost benefit on that quite rigorously reviewed scheme was very strong and was pointing in exactly the direction that any rational assessment of Australia's future would suggest. And, of course, the market Australia scheme has already gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So all the programs for Asian engagement have been cut. We now also have an attack upon skills development; the universities are in serious danger and, through the industrial relations bill and associated changes to traineeships and apprenticeships, the whole commitment to a skilled work force is under threat. For apprentices, we have their wages already under threat; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1573"> similarly, for trainees. I want to make one thing perfectly clear about all this. The opposition will not support any changes which reduce the wages or working conditions of young people in general, or trainees or apprentices in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is widespread apprehension that the changes in the industrial relations legislation are code for the old $3 an hour youth wage. Certainly, we see the perpetuation of junior rates. Certainly, we see broader discretions under Australian workplace agreements and potentially, although I think it will not come to pass, under certified agreements&mdash;at least it will not come to pass under certified agreements in which trade unions are involved. But we see broader discretions, under those provisions in the new legislation, about discounting wages for time off to train.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apprentices' wages are already discounted to take their status and training into account, and it would be a double penalty to seek to reduce their rates further by not paying them while they are at TAFE. I am not sure what will happen to those apprentices who get block release and who go to TAFE for six weeks at a time. I am not quite sure how it is envisaged that they will be rewarded for that period. But this proposal reverses the practice of at least 50 years in Australia&mdash;and more than 50 years internationally&mdash;where young men and women doing what Australia needs them to do, which is develop their skills, may have their pay cut and will not be supported by us in any way at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cuts to expenditure, to programs, and to public sector employment, are of course not surprising. They were sadly predictable. The now&hyphen;government&mdash;the then&hyphen;opposition before the election&mdash;said that it could fund all its programs with a two per cent efficiency dividend which would cost only 2,500 jobs. At least that is what it said here in Canberra. It tried to say to my constituents, and to the constituents of the other electorates here, that that is all that would take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 21 February, I was able to put out a press release during the election campaign showing that even what the then opposition was proposing would cost a minimum of almost 6,000 jobs&mdash;in fact 5,800 jobs. The honourable member for Farrer and now Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) foreshadowing this in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Riverine Herald</EMPHASIS> in some remarks which he hoped were not going to be reported, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if those changes mean 20,000 less public servants, so be it.</PARA>
<PARA>The statements were subsequently rigorously denied, and he tried to brow&hyphen;beat the journalist into pretending that he had not said them, but they have proved to be remarkably accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, as a member for Canberra, that causes me great concern. But the cuts go far beyond Canberra. I have to wonder what the people of Bendigo have done to the Liberal Party. The Kennett government has attacked them mercilessly. We found that there were cuts to the Bendigo hospital, to public nursing homes, to the Mount Alexander Hospital, to psychiatric services to the Bendigo and Loddon prisons, to schools and to the schools' regional office and professional support staff, to the railway workshops and rail workers based in Bendigo and Castlemaine, to water schemes, to the SEC, to gas and fuel, to conservation and natural resources, housing and planning and community health centres, ambulance services and the department of labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the Kennett government's proud record for Bendigo. Now we find Bendigo targeted for the removal of the Taxation Office and the Family Court registry. We find that the university, which is such an important part of that city and its strategy for development, is clearly under threat with Commonwealth government cuts to universities being proposed. It <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1574"> is the regional universities who are most vulnerable. Melbourne University and the University of Sydney will not enjoy the cuts but they have an enormous financial capacity to weather the storm. It is the new universities, the developing outpost and regional universities and regional campuses of established universities that are going to feel the greatest pressure. Bendigo is one of those places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, I wonder what the people of Bendigo have done to the Liberal Party to deserve so much continuous focus and attack from this government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the final two or three minutes I want to talk briefly about an area where, of course, I have a different responsibility and that is the area of industrial relations where we are seeing some very perverse cuts. We are finding a lot of advocacy of the Industrial Relations Commission. The government keeps saying that the commission will have a key role and that it particularly seeks to enhance its role in the area of unfair dismissals. At the same time it is making cuts to the budget of the Industrial Relations Commission. That means that all the part&hyphen;time conciliators employed by the Industrial Relations Commission to deal with unfair dismissal cases have had to be dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is saying that it is going to staff the office of the employment advocate from staff of the Department of Industrial Relations, and that the employment advocate is going to be the great support for small business and for employees under this brave new world of Australian workplace agreements&mdash;and yet it is slashing the number of staff in the Department of Industrial Relations by 17 per cent. It is hard to know who is going to provide the advice that will be so sorely needed under this new legislation. Who is going to conduct the inspections? Who is going to provide the representation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some ways, what are worse than that are the cuts to Worksafe Australia. Those cuts mean that things that go to the core issue of occupational health and safety in our society will be in jeopardy. There are going to be major cuts to Worksafe. To be fair to the government, it did say in advance that it would make cuts to Worksafe. I have to say it does not make me feel much better about it, but it is true. I wonder if the government is aware of statistics which indicate that non&hyphen;English speaking migrants are four times more likely to be killed in their first year in Australian workplaces than Australian&hyphen;born workers. If so, it seems to me that we should all be concerned that funding cuts to Worksafe Australia will lead to cutbacks to programs aimed at addressing that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am concerned about&mdash;and what motivated me to make my first brave venture into the world of the Main Committee&mdash;is making the situation clear to the people of Australia. I want to make this clear to the people of Canberra and to the people who are affected by these cuts and by the parallel proposals to change the industrial relations laws of the country in ways that can only be detrimental to the interests of so many people&mdash;especially to people who are the most vulnerable. Those who are most dependent upon government support are those who are most vulnerable. Those who are most dependent upon the support of the great pillars of our industrial relations system are most vulnerable. I want to say to them that this is not the direction in which I believe Australians want their society to be taken.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will attempt not to plagiarise him&mdash;and I thought I might make some comments about what has taken place in the other chamber in regard to that in a minute. Supply Bill (No. 1) leads to a wide ranging discussion. I do not think I would do either myself or my party justice if I did not commence my contribution by making it clear to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to everyone on the other side of the House that, in every forum, everywhere I travel in Australia&mdash;whether it is locally or interstate or wherever&mdash;the very first point I make in my speech is to inform people about what we correctly call the Costello con.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By that I mean the attempt to create the image that there is some kind of black hole in Labor's budget. I note with some interest that audiences are starting to understand that it is a con and, in fact, they are saying to me, `Oh well, that is what you politicians always do.' So the Prime Minister (John Howard) and his team, who have campaigned under this great aura of bringing new standards to politics, are already being seen by the general public as being just another lot of politicians distorting the budget figures in order to justify their policy positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the reaction an incoming government, with the majority it has and the honeymoon period it would expect, would expect to be getting just two or three months down the track. It is worth making the point that failing to tell people that there are revised Treasury figures&mdash;that there are revised estimates on the growth rates in the economy&mdash;while painting this picture of Labor's black hole, leaves the government's position open for us to move in and explain just what is different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite markedly different to the situation that Labor inherited when John Howard had a letter from Treasury pointing out that there would be a $9.6 billion deficit&mdash;$23 billion in today's money. He had that letter and concealed it. It is an absolutely different situation to come into office to be confronted with revised Treasury estimates based on changes in the growth of the economy. I will not go into that in great detail now but I can assure members opposite that I do in every forum I visit. At the end of those discussions, when people come to talk to me about it they have understood well that it is a Costello con. They have understood well that the figures have been revised and we all should be moving on from that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on to what? Moving on to a litany of broken promises. Here is stage 2 of the collapse of the Howard enigma&mdash;honest John. His government was wanted because he convinced the electors that really not much would change. Now what are they finding? Fightback 96, not even minus the GST. We now have the mooted three per cent tariff changes which effectively add a three per cent tariff excise on a whole range of imported goods. It is just another form of introducing Fightback plus its GST. We will be making that point. It does not surprise me that honourable members opposite look a little sheepish when confronted with the fact&mdash;as they will be in all their electorates&mdash;that not only have they been running the Costello con but they have been using it as a justification to break promises and introduce Fightback plus its GST. None of that was on the agenda that people were informed about.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1576">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now talk specifically about areas in my shadow portfolio of responsibility: energy and resources. There are key areas of doubt arising in this portfolio area just as there are in other areas that my colleagues have spoken about in their particular contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One that is attracting some public interest at the moment is the diesel fuel rebate. Many times in our 13 years in office the Department of Finance trotted up with its proposals that the government either reduce or remove the diesel rebate as an attractive means of saving revenue in the budget. Every time it was put on the table we discussed it among ourselves and resolved that this particular measure was too important as an input cost in the primary sector to make any change to the cost of fuel. In other words, Labor, who these people constantly run around country Australia talking about as people who represent areas in the city, showed consistently during its 13 years a quite steadfast commitment to assisting the transfer to competitiveness in Australia's rural sector. Despite all the arguments and all the pressure, we resisted completely any moves to wind back the diesel fuel rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems from the Prime Minister's statement to the National Farmers Federation yesterday afternoon that maybe the farmers have an assurance that it will stay in place for them. We are waiting to see whether that guarantee will be kept for fishing, for mining, for exploration and for all the non&hyphen;farm primary sector industries who, at the moment, enjoy the full diesel fuel rebate. Needless to say, this debate will continue until the Budget is brought down and all is revealed. The most interesting thing about this is why these people are left in doubt about something like this, especially when they are making investments now based on long-term judgments about their costs and their returns. Why would you leave them in doubt?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are confronted here with the world's greatest environment package. We are going to flog off Telecom to pay for it but we are going to introduce the world's greatest environment package. At the same time we are proposing to increase woodchipping in Australia despite this national debate about conservation, the environment, the timber industry and the green movement that we have been through recently to the point where most Australians think that the balance must be just about right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite that debate, what are these characters going to do? They are going to increase the volume of export woodchips just after we have been through this painful process of driving investment in value added production in Australia and of driving investment in plantation strategies in Australia. What are they going to do? They are going to give them back their export woodchip licences and go right back down the road of exporting woodchips and then importing paper products. It is about as loopy a policy proposal as one could imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when we are going to have this world's greatest environment package we are also going to increase uranium mining in Australia. There will be open slather for uranium mines. I know how those signals are received by young people in Australia. I know how those signals are received by people in urban and rural communities who have paid a lot of attention to this environment debate. I say to those members opposite that sending out signals like increasing uranium mining and increasing uranium exports and increasing woodchip exports is sending out the wrong signals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are industries which are very capital intensive. They employ very few people. As an analogy, I have a forest in the middle of my electorate. It is a forest that has been the subject of quite a bit of debate. In my forest&mdash;I call it mine&mdash;there are about 300 people employed in operating the timber mills and in managing the forest. There are 10 people employed at the woodchip export end of the industry. To reinstate those licences and to reinstate those export <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1577"> woodchips in that forest probably adds, at best, three or four jobs for $X million worth of increased investment. However, the same investment made instead in expanded plantation or in expanded value adding in the timber mills in my region would create at least 30 to 50 new jobs. The proposed strategy is a dill strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say to those opposite that they are going to find it very difficult to portray themselves as marketing the world's best environment package while they are increasing the export of woodchips out of Australia and while they are increasing uranium mining in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of these things raise also&mdash;and I hesitate to touch on this topic&mdash;the issue of propriety. It has certainly been touched on in the other place by Senator Collins in his questions. We have seen this crowd come into office. Okay, they are new, they are yet to learn about the responsibilities of being a minister of the Crown. They are yet to learn about the proprieties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where Senator Herron, to start with, has had to be told to stop practising his medicine because he cannot possibly be receiving an income as a minister of the Crown and be doing another job, particularly if he is getting paid Medibank payments while he is a minister of the Crown. There is a direct conflict of interest there and it is not acceptable that he does it. He has now got the message from the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Parer, I noticed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on the weekend, announced that his wife has had to sell her shares in BHP and some other companies. She was very unhappy about it too because she has had to take a loss. She did it because she is associated with him and there are possible conflicts of interest as he is the Minister for Resources and Energy. If you want the job you have to accept these disciplines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what do we have with the farmers? Where does the Prime Minister sit with the farmers in his cabinet? We have the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), the Minister for Transport (Mr Sharp)&mdash;all serious, large property owners, all rural producers. What happens in the cabinet room when they consider the diesel fuel rebate? What happens when they consider the latest wool tax change? What happens when they consider things like incentives and subsidies for farmers who have been caught&mdash;things such as drought relief or periods of downturns in income when we have to change the Social Security provisions to enable farmers to earn extra income or receive assistance under government programs? What do these characters do? Do they suddenly put their hands up and say, `I have a direct interest in this. I am going to leave the cabinet room'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From what John Howard said in the House of Representatives chamber I do not think they are worried about it. They do not perceive any conflict of interest. Well, by gee, we do. It is not appropriate for ministers of the Crown to be making decisions about matters of finance from which they are likely to be direct beneficiaries of their own decisions. And nowhere is this more evident than in the area of primary industries and resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also moved&mdash;already&mdash;into trying to slip things through. While we are trying to be the providers of the world's greatest environment package, we have suddenly found the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) slipping through, on the back of a Customs bill in the Senate, an attempt to remove Australia's government controls on minerals export licences. It sounds a bit complicated; it probably does not mean much. But the bottom line on it is that the federal parliament, through this legislation, gives the minister the power to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1578"> have the final say about whether any mineral export commodity can or cannot be exported, and under what terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser used those controls to stop sandmining on Fraser Island. They were the only measures that could be used&mdash;and they were there. During the last 13 years, Labor ministers regularly intervened in coal negotiations with our main international buyers to insist that Australian coal exporters received a better price than they had been able to negotiate. We have had many tales from the industry about the poor negotiating performance of the cartel that represents the owners and producers of coalmines in Australia, and several times the Australian minister has used this power to intervene and drive a better coal price for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Five minutes into the job, what has Senator Parer done? Stuck a little amendment in the back of a Customs bill, hoping no&hyphen;one would notice it and it would be slipped through the Senate, to scrap the whole thing altogether. Fortunately, a diligent opposition has managed to pick this up and, with the support of the minor parties in the Senate, we have disallowed that attempt. But why on earth would you do it? Why on earth, as resources and energy minister, would you slip in and hand away the only power the federal parliament and the federal government have to manage the export of minerals from Australia when we are such an important mineral producing country? It is a question yet to be answered. I know what happened but I cannot, for the life of me, fathom why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing something very interesting developing, particularly in regional and rural electorates. I was just beside myself with joy&mdash;and I am sure the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) would like my use of that term; I heard him talking the other day about oral promiscuity, I think it was&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whatever it was, I thought I would say I was beside myself with joy at the election of a former member of this place, Harry Woods, in New South Wales at the weekend. It showed us that constituents in regional and rural Australia, in particular, are focusing very strongly on the performance of their local candidates and that they are no longer going to be served the drivel that National Party members wander around serving. Now they have the responsibility of government, they are going to be bound by some of their arguments and nowhere will this show up more than in the Telecom debate. We know from our own work on this that the rural cross&hyphen;subsidy is worth at least $500 to $600 million a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has only to remember the experience with the Commonwealth Bank; the moment it became partially privatised, it started to dump on its country constituents by closing branches. It also started to dump on people who had high volume, low profit accounts. No&hyphen;one in this parliament should delude themselves for one minute that a partially privatised Telecom would not behave exactly the same way. No&hyphen;one is going to bear the brunt of that policy move more than those members on the other side who now represent regional and country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Guess where we will be? We will be in those electorates pointing out that no matter what drivel these people serve up at local meetings, here in the federal parliament they are voting for services to be carved up by a privatised Telecom.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up the time of the Committee for long. The matter that has caused me to speak on the supply bill is a matter of some urgency in the electorate. It basically revolves around the question of the Nowergup airport which has been proposed in my electorate as the second regional airport in the metropolitan area for Perth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular proposal has elicited one of the largest turnouts at a council meeting organised by the city of Wanneroo for some years. In fact, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;one ought to acknowledge one's sources when speaking&mdash;at a meeting last night in the city of Wanneroo chambers about 1,500 people turned up to protest against the proposal for a regional airport at Nowergup. Anybody in politics knows that 1,500 is a large number of people to come out from a community and protest about any sort of proposal, let alone one that is relatively localised. It indicates the concern of residents about what is apparently, on the part of the state government, being seen as a fait accompli.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) also has some important matters he wants to address in relation to the supply bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I would like to make a few observations about the matter, which is of concern for a number of reasons. The first is that the Nowergup regional airport is proposed to be sited on top of the Gnangara water mound, which is an important part of the water supply sources for the Perth metropolitan area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important concerns relate to the impact of an airport of such a size on the residents in the vicinity. They will be affected not only by the noise of aircraft but also by all the other aspects of the conduct of such an airport that would infringe on their rights and lifestyles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to recognise that not very far away from the proposed site is RAAF Pearce. In the article by Carolyn Martin in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian </EMPHASIS>this morning, the commander of RAAF Pearce, Group Captain Dennis Green, was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . none of these sites&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>these are the sites that have been proposed for the second regional airport in the Perth metropolitan area&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was acceptable to the RAAF and the Department of Transport had been told this.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot think of anything more irresponsible than to propose the construction of an airport that is being opposed by or protested against by the RAAF who, obviously, have substantial military aircraft movements in the vicinity. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We have the responsibility for the busiest military airport in Australia and we have to ensure its safety."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There had to be compatibility between relatively slow civil aviation traffic and fast, highly manoeuvrable military aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suspected for some time by residents in the area that the state government had already selected Nowergup as their preferred site. They talked, in the first instance, of other sites. There was talk, for instance, of sites at Neerabup, Wilbinga and Ledge Point. It appears to people who have followed this particular issue for some time that the committee had already made its mind up and it selected Nowergup without properly consulting the local population. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1580"> This was the reason for such a large and angry crowd at the city of Wanneroo chambers last night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a person who has campaigned for some time, supporting a group known as the Residents Against Nowergup/Neerabup Airport Proposal Group, I can well understand the frustration and anger of residents when they are faced with what appears to be an intractable state government which makes a decision and then forces that decision on local residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just make an observation, if I may, about Gnangara water mound. As Perth's major source of vital ground water, it is essential that it should be protected from pollution. Any development that occurs within its catchment areas must be guaranteed not to pollute. Problems are already occurring at Jandakot&mdash;that is the first Perth regional airport&mdash;due to plumes traced to fuel storage. No airport or industry can guarantee that this will not occur on the Gnangara water mound with either the Nowergup or Neerabup proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other major concerns that have been voiced by local environment groups&mdash;and I am grateful to them for providing me with this material&mdash;include: destruction of native bushland, wildlife and habitats; risks of ground water pollution from above&hyphen;ground or underground storage tanks; on&hyphen;site disposal of liquid effluent, including sewerage solvents and other degreasers which would pose threats to local ground water; and underground pipe work associated with above&hyphen;ground storage. Tanks would be an added risk and any leaks would be difficult to monitor. Major roads to service the facility would need to be put in place, and general operation of aircraft would require movement of large quantities of fuel, leading to the possibility of accidental spillage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the infrastructure would increase with use and growth of the aerodrome. For example, at Jandakot, the Federal Airports Corporation sought permission to develop and extend light industry around the airport facility. There is no guarantee that this would not occur in this particular case. I have already mentioned the noise pollution and the other safety aspects associated with a very busy regional airport operating within close proximity to important regional development in the northern suburbs of Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under normal circumstances, one might cop the usual criticism: `not in my backyard', `these people are somehow opposed to development', or `they are some sort of economic vandals opposed to reasonable development'. Let me make this observation: this development is apparently going to happen at Nowergup with little to no consultation on the part of the state Department of Transport, which has responsibility for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, there is a strong concern, particularly on the part of those who purchased land in the last few years, about the suggestion that they effectively bought land knowing that there was going to be such an airport within very close proximity to their residences. The residents have petitioned the Legislative Council in the Western Australian parliament. They have petitioned the city of Wanneroo; the meeting had to be abandoned last night because so many people were there. They objected to the establishment of a second general aviation airport at Nowergup and Neerabup within the city of Wanneroo because of concerns about safety and noise pollution; flight paths and circuit training allowing low flying aircraft to pass over extensive established residential areas, including schools, childminding centres, aged accommodation and community facilities; the environmental impact; and the proximity to RAAF Pearce and the difficulties that may be incurred in relation to the operation of military aircraft in adjoining air space.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1581">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the frequent complaints of residents in the area has been the early circulation often of military aircraft. Most recently, aircraft of the Royal Singapore Air Force were training using Pearce Air Base airspace by arrangement with the Australian government. They have a memorandum of understanding and in some instances there has been strong criticism of the arrangements. Nonetheless, there is an arrangement with RAAF Pearce, and I have had complaints from residents about low flying aircraft already. I have made representations to RAAF Pearce, whose personnel have cooperated fully and have been very quick to try and rectify any particular community complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this instance, the Minister for Transport in the Western Australian government really has to look very closely at the procedures his department used to introduce this new Nowergup B site for a second regional airport. In fact, it has been estimated that there may well be anything up to 150,000 air movements in one year, which is quite an extraordinary number&mdash;it is about half the traffic currently at Jandakot. Those who are familiar with the Perth metropolitan area would know that there are some very substantial concerns from Jandakot residents about the noise, safety and other infringements on their lifestyles that they see from the operation of the Jandakot regional airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that at any stage in residential development there must be clear consultation with the community. There must be an opportunity for the community to voice their concerns long before a proposed site for a second regional airport is selected for preference by such an instrumentality as the Department of Transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand for the life of me why the local Liberal state member in the state government, who has told parliament that he was not informed of this choice, was left out in the cold, or why residents have had to take the trouble of mounting a substantial protest at the city of Wanneroo and elsewhere through petitions and the like to voice their concerns. I am with the residents. Their interests must come first and, as far as I am concerned, Nowergup or Neerabup are both inappropriate sites for a second regional airport in Perth. If they want to suggest an area, they should look outside the major metropolitan growth area and, in the first instance, they must consult with the local residents.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am deeply concerned that the Howard government has adopted the very short&hyphen;sighted view of classifying research effort as an expense rather than as an investment and, if there is a commitment to reducing outlays generally, research will be at the top of the list, not at the bottom. It is not the first government to take that view, and it will not be the last, but it is damaging to the national interest and a classic illustration of false economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to an enormously important scientific project which Australia has dropped out of, the European Southern Observatory&mdash;ESO. I know my colleague the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) will be returning to this theme later. Australia has taken the leading role in Southern Hemisphere astronomy since 1868, first with optical and later with optical and radio instruments. Because there are more interesting phenomena in the southern heavens, and Australia has a splendid view of the celestial axis, we are well placed to make the major contribution. The UK Schmidt Telescope, the Anglo&hyphen;Australian Telescope at Siding Spring, the great radio telescopes at Parkes, Tidbinbilla and the Australia Telescope, also at Siding Spring, have made tremendous international contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the European Space Observatory is a unique opportunity for us. Eight European nations are in the ESO project: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1582"> and Sweden. They are proposing to build what will be the most powerful optical telescope array in the world at Cerro Paranal, a mountain in the Atacama desert in northern Chile. Why the Atacama desert, I hear the honourable members for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) cry. The reasons are simple: because of its extraordinary dryness and elevation, there is no pollution, almost no water vapour and very rare clouding and so there is a very high proportion of clear nights. Atacama is regarded as the best place in the world for observation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Uniquely of nations in the Southern Hemisphere, Australia has been invited to be a participant. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) wrote a very disturbing, dear John letter, dated 23 May 1996&mdash;in this case, a dear Ricardo letter&mdash;to Professor Ricardo Giacconi, the Director-General, the European Southern Observatory. He said that, while he would not want to rule out the possibility of Australia seeking membership at some time in the future were it to be offered, we are not able to continue with any negotiations. I make some reference about the costs involved because I think we have to put it in context. The cost suggested is of the order of $28 million. The notes read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This consists of an up&hyphen;front contribution of $13 million determined as a GDP&hyphen;based share of the VLT's existing capitalisation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Incidentally, I read this from some notes thoughtfully provided by the Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring observatories. I want to get the details absolutely right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">together with an annual capital subscription towards VLT&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, very large telescope&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">construction of $3 Million per year in each of the 5 years up to the years 2000&hyphen;01. In addition there is an operational subscription of $3 Million per year to be funded through the annual contributions of $1.2 Million from the Australian Astronomy Consortium, $0.6 Million in ARC infrastructure grants, $0.4 Million through DIST and an offset of $0.8 Million against use by ESO members of the Australia Telescope National Facility.</PARA>
<PARA>I explain that the other $3 million there is already committed, assuming that we join ESO. The sum in new money required over a five&hyphen;year period would be a grand total of $28 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is in a very strong position to have full recapture of the up-front expenditure. There is an accepted precedent that some European countries have followed where, if we say, `We are going to put money into this but we want our space and astronomy qualified industries to provide the equipment,' it is not hard to imagine areas for space related and astronomy qualified industries where Australia is very well placed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are showcase areas of industry which Australia wants to develop in Europe and where it wants to build up linkages. Most of Australia's contribution to the project would be in the form of sophisticated state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art electronics, robotics, optics, image processing and software components and instruments, the development of which will help to strengthen our competitive edge in high technology industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national benefits of ESO membership are very significant. Australia has been invited to join&mdash;the first member outside Europe. The time to join is during construction, when it is low cost with more benefits. The first telescope is to be opened in 1998. The ESO has a good track record. Australia will complement it. Without question, the VLT is the most important astronomy project in the world. No single country can afford to build a telescope like this. Through ESO, the Australian share of this enormous product&mdash;this half billion dollar project&mdash;is affordable. I point, too, to the regional significance of Chile, South America and the Pacific.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1583">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To illustrate the power of the proposed new instrument, I point out that the Anglo&hyphen;Australian Telescope, our biggest optical instrument, has a mirror of four metres. The ESO will consist of four telescopes, each with a mirror of eight metres operating as a phased array. That creates a synergy, where the total surface area may have resolution capacity equal to a telescope with a mirror of perhaps 20 metres&mdash;in other words, a mirror that is considerably bigger than this vast chamber that we are talking in at the moment. The great Australia Telescope commissioned in 1988 also operates as a phased array of several instruments, but that is a radio telescope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the creation of a new and high&hyphen;powered lobby group&mdash;the Higher Education Alliance. It consists of distinguished representatives of the four Australian academies. The four Australian academies comprise the most distinguished Australian academics&mdash;and one or two outsiders&mdash;and were set up by royal warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The representative of the Australian Academy of Science is Dr Keith Boardman, the former chief executive of CSIRO. The representative of the Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering is Dr Greg Tegart, former secretary of the Department of Science. The representative of the Australian Academy of the Humanities is Professor Tony Lowe, and of the Australian Academy of Social Sciences, Professor Paul Bourke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Universities and the CSIRO, as I can testify from my own experience as a minister, operate with a very high level of recurrent and unavoidable expenses: salaries, superannuation contributions, vehicle costs, repairs and maintenance, standard equipment. A cut of one, two or three per cent&mdash;which, perhaps when you say it quickly, does not sound like very much&mdash;has a devastating impact on what are regarded as discretionary funds available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has a devastating effect on attempting anything new. It can be extraordinarily debilitating. This is a by&hyphen;product in part of seeing research organisations&mdash;and I would have to confess that the previous government was very occasionally guilty of the same view&mdash;as business corporations. People say, `If you can't get a buck, if you can't get an outside contribution from industry, maybe it is not worth doing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that, if organisations are totally reliant on outside funding, it means that they are going to have an extraordinarily conservative research profile. Funding will come in for areas that are known and familiar and where there is a demonstrable pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. But anything of a speculative nature, anything that leads into something that is completely new, will not attract that kind of outside development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The newspaper reports about the setting up of the Higher Education Alliance point out that it includes the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations, the National Tertiary Education Union, the Federation of Australian Science and Technology, the Australian University Alumni Council and the National Union of Students. I cannot remember for very many years when there has been such a degree of unity. There is genuine concern about what will happen to our universities and, in particular, fear that the cutbacks will reinforce the mediocre and the familiar and encourage a very significant brain drain, where some of our finest people will disappear overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to talk about the Customs Service but I will postpone that until the Customs Bill is debated. I want to spend a few moments on the recurrent problem of violence which concerns so many of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1982, the American political philosopher, Marshall Berman, published an extraordinary book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">All That is Solid Melts Into Air</EMPHASIS>, subtitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Experience of Modernity</EMPHASIS>. He wrote <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1584"> about the impact of growing technological power coupled with personal impoverishment and alienation, the fear of being degraded, and the loss of understanding, leading to a sense of impotent rage, a loss of control and the use of violence to express that rage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Berman is a profound student of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's great novel, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Brothers Karamazov</EMPHASIS>, with its uncanny insight into mass murder, serial killing and alienation. I might interpolate that it is probably some time since Dostoyevsky has been raised in a supply bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Berman dedicated his own book to the memory of his son, Marc, who had been murdered at the age of five. There is a terrible poignancy in the words of his preface. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shortly after I finished this book, my dear son Marc, five years old, was taken from me. I dedicate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">All That is Solid Melts Into Air</EMPHASIS>  to him. His life and death bring so many of its ideas and themes close to home: the idea that those who are most happily at home in the modern world, as he was, may be most vulnerable to the demons that haunt it; the idea that the daily routine of playgrounds and bicycles, of shopping and eating and cleaning up, of ordinary hugs and kisses, may be not only infinitely joyous and beautiful but also infinitely precarious and fragile; that it may take desperate and heroic struggles to sustain this life, and sometimes we lose. Ivan Karamazov says that, more than anything else, the death of children makes him want to give back his ticket to the universe. But he does not give it back. He keeps on fighting and loving; he keeps on keeping on.</PARA>
<PARA>They are Berman's words, not mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Port Arthur massacre which I return to was not merely a Tasmanian tragedy; it was not even an Australian one. Its implications are universal, forcing us to confront the dark side of human nature, specifically, masculine aggression, as illustrated by some elements of the gun culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the victims, Peter Nash, a 32&hyphen;year&hyphen;old painter and decorator, came from Hoppers Crossing in the electorate of Lalor. I talked to him on polling day and he visited my electoral office less than a month before he died. He was shot dead as he shielded his wife, Carolyn, in the Broad Arrow Cafe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a sense, the limits of philosophical debate were set out in the 17th Century by two great English philosophers, Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. They turn on different interpretations on the nature of human beings: whether human nature is debased and needs controlling, or whether it is perfectible, needing encouragement. The party of Hobbes is essentially pessimistic, fatalistic, defensive and authoritarian, while the party of Locke is optimistic, idealistic, open and sceptical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our political system operates in the middle ground but there are elements of Hobbes and Locke&mdash;sometimes both&mdash;in us all. But events, such as the Port Arthur, Dunblane or Oklahoma City massacres, or suicide bombings, ethnic cleansing, or saturation bombings, challenge or shake any optimistic Lockean view about the nature of human relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our media is saturated with blood inevitably leading to the risk of desensitising citizens, especially young ones, about violence. The media have moral responsibilities about selectivity and emphasis but, essentially, they report a world that they did not create. Let me just quote myself for a few moments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since governments might have been expected to take the lead&mdash;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1585">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in planning for an era of unusually rapid change, collapse of confidence in the political process&mdash;a loss of legitimacy&mdash;was the most serious issue of them all. The decades following have exacerbated the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the United States, strong, rich and well&hyphen;educated, a significant minority repudiated the open society, mainstream politics, and sceptical detachment. The collapse of confidence led to a conviction that government was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">enemy</EMPHASIS> , engaged in a conspiracy against the people. Gun ownership was equated with self defence and freedom. The liberal left had deep concerns about John Kennedy's assassination, the Vietnam War and Watergate. Parallel concerns on the right were taken up by religious fundamentalists, cults and armed militias, leading, at its most extreme, to a paranoid view that Washington had become a `Zionist Occupation Government'(ZOG) and terrorist acts such as the Oklahoma City bomb blast (April 1995). As with Hitler's Nazis, this was a classic illustration of `the revenge of the powerless'. At a time when technology provided a unique capacity to break down hierarchies and promote individual autonomy, citizens felt confused, marginalised and frustrated, and fear encouraged a desperate recourse to violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This collapse of confidence in government has occurred in varying degrees in the former USSR, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Italy, Japan, Canada and some Australian states.</PARA>
<PARA>As a democracy&mdash;one of the great democratic success stories&mdash;Australia should be devoting time and effort to understanding the problem of violence, and masculine aggression in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens, quite often, after an incident such as Port Arthur, is that a national consensus develops very quickly. But that national consensus, which involves haste and making a very firm decision, can ebb away. We can already see some indication&mdash;I would say at the periphery of our political process rather than at the centre&mdash;of a desire to overturn the decision. I always remember some words&mdash;they turned out to be quite prophetic words&mdash;by Barry Unsworth when he was Premier of New South Wales. In 1988, the bicentennial year, he made a very serious attempt to get the states on side and the then Prime Minister agreed but there was very strong opposition from the coalition. I remember that as he left that unsuccessful meeting of premiers he uttered some unusually prophetic words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will require some bloody tragedy in Tasmania to bring the nation to its senses, to make people realise the extraordinary fragility of our society, the extraordinary damage, the extraordinary power that can be done with these high powered guns.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a contribution this evening on the Supply Bill to outline a number of problems I see in the government's program, as far as we are able to determine it. As Saul points out in his excellent commentary on modern technocracies&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Doubter's Companion</EMPHASIS> &mdash;`A nation cannot make debts sustainable by cutting costs. Cuts may produce marginal savings, but savings are not cash flow'&mdash;a lesson the current government does not seem to have learned. It is another example of what Saul calls the alchemist's temptation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Thatcher spent a decade trying to slash the British national debt. She had the advantage of being able to use the North Sea income for this purpose, something the government is trying to do with Telstra&mdash;a very similar set of proposals. I remind it that the result was a damaged industrial sector, economic stagnation and endemic unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If undertaken too rapidly or extensively, the payment of debt can be a major drain on investment and growth. We see, for example, proposals to cut DIFF and EMDG, making exports more problematic than they have been in the past. An obsession with debt repayment to the exclusion of other economic and social values indicates a narrow and very managerial approach to economics and one, incidentally, bound to fail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to just briefly and perhaps with some humour draw on the same writer I mentioned earlier, Saul, and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Doubter's Companion</EMPHASIS>. He underlines the need for a degree of realism from the government, which I think is lacking, and shows some scepticism about, for instance, Treasury forecasts and economic predictions. Saul says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Draw up a list of the large economic problems to have struck the West over the last quarter century, determine the dominant strand of advice offered in each case by the community of economists, calculate how many times this advice was followed&mdash;and more often than not it was&mdash;finally, add up the number of times this advice solved the problem. The answer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he says, humorously but accurately&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">seems to be zero.</PARA>
<PARA>In recent weeks the coalition has sought to create the impression that they are faced with a substantial blow&hyphen;out in the budget deficit as a result of Labor's financial mismanagement. Indeed, it is a result of Treasury forecasts having changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very cynical and convenient fiction which they hope will provide a blind for their intended and ideologically driven cuts to the public sector and to government programs. Many of the floated cuts bear a striking resemblance to those included in the now discredited Fightback document, which the coalition took to the 1993 election and which was, incidentally, repudiated by the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The view expressed by three senior academic experts in this field exposes the lie of Costello's claims. They argue, tellingly, that the focus first of all is on the wrong figure, that the figure itself is not a firm figure and that budget cuts of the magnitude proposed by the government may produce the opposite effect to that intended and actually slow down the economy and increase unemployment&mdash;the Thatcher warning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professors Argy, Gruen and Neville ask that the public debate on the deficit be put in perspective. They point out that the consideration should include the non&hyphen;budget sector and the outcome of state government finances at the very least. Whether such expenditure is incurred for capital or recurrent expenditure is also seen as critical for any intelligent assessment of its potential impact&mdash;again something that is lacking from the government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1587">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The professors also point out that the $8 billion `is not firm'&mdash;a polite way, in my view, of saying they are very rubbery&mdash;since it is based on a Treasury forecast assuming no policy changes and a growth rate of the economy of 3.25 per cent. This is a reduction of 0.5 per cent in each of the years 1995&hyphen;96, 1996&hyphen;97 and 1997&hyphen;98. Indeed, the figures that will come out this week may well repudiate that figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such a difference and the associated changes forecast in employment growth, which they say will be slower, and inflation, which they say will be higher, account for 90 per cent of the change in budget forecasts. The Treasurer's own press release&mdash;perhaps this was a Treasury bit and not his own political spin&mdash;admits that figures are subject to substantial revision. You can bet your life on that!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the agenda for the coalition is to encourage a public perception that they have no choice, poor souls, but to break their election promises or in some cases to cut functions and effective programs in order to fund some of those it committed to during the campaign. So out the window with what works and in with the experiments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Estimates from the Department of Finance demonstrated that they made $6.7 billion worth of commitments during the election campaign, but there were serious shortfalls and inaccuracies in their costings making their proposed `savings' of $8.8 billion inadequate. In fact, they have a $4 billion hole in the budget all of their own making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most alarming aspects of the government's rhetoric and of its apparently intended strategy is that cuts of the magnitude proposed may exacerbate unemployment and slow growth, and a lot of people are now worried about that outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purported relationship between reductions in the government budget deficit and interest rates is speculative at best, though it is often repeated by the Treasurer, with little academic background. It is estimated by reputable commentators, as opposed to the Treasurer, to be of vanishingly small significance even if it is accepted. Indeed, the Reserve Bank governor recently repudiated any significant connection between a budget deficit reduction and interest rates but he did point to the importance of wage restraint, when the coalition has clearly abandoned a wages policy with predictable economic outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to say that all these cuts translate into real effects on public sector employment, on the purchase of goods and services by government, and on the extent and quality of services provided to the community. Many of them, I might say, have irreversible long&hyphen;term effects. I do not believe any government has the right to sell off an asset the size of Telstra, for example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also has effects on entitlements and benefits provided to individuals, to families and to businesses. None of the cuts anticipated so far appear to offer any prospect at all for improvement in the standard of living or the quality of life for the average Australian. That is what voters at least have a right to expect. All of this needs to be viewed in the context of the Prime Minister's promise that his party would honour its promises even if the budget circumstances were found to be worse than they were publicly stated to be by the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that senior members of the coalition and their economic advisers were aware&mdash;clearly aware&mdash;of the slowing of the economy and the possible deterioration in budget outcomes. There was a lot of speculation about it. Therefore, there can be no excuse at all for the blatant breaches of commitment that they now appear to be contemplating. There is no excuse at all. They understood the circumstances.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1588">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting too, before I go on to a couple of areas of specific cuts, that Australia's public sector is already very lean. So when they say they are going to cut the public sector, they mean they are cutting programs, handing them back to the states with a discount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia already has the second smallest public sector, and that includes all levels of government, among OECD nations. Since 1983, the population has grown by 17.4 per cent and GDP by 51 per cent. However, during that same period the number of public servants has dropped by 18 per cent, hardly fat in the system. It needs to be remembered that the effects of substantial and sudden reductions in the public sector work force will be felt, and are already being felt, not only in the ACT but also in regional Australia. The reductions imposed exceed already the promised maximum of 2,500 people and are, with the two per cent running cost reductions, already in excess of 9,000. And that is before we get to the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at Supply that we are talking about this evening, it is already mooted that there will be cuts to environmental programs quite apart from those which will result from the inept attempt to link the sale of a major public asset, Telstra, with decent funding for the environment and land care programs. There are going to be cuts on top of that. The minister himself, on the weekend, said that the $1 billion fund was planned to be built on existing programs. He said that that was `our ideal', that that is `what we would like'. He added that existing programs, however, are being reviewed in the way that all programs are. In other words, there are going to be cuts before they get to that point to find savings. He said that `it was to be additional money'. Notice the past tense. It is not now to be additional money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, for instance, has not indicated in the lead&hyphen;up to this supply bill that it will provide for any more than the maintenance of the former government's forward estimates. That means that funding for 10 key conservation programs will actually cease on 30 June. We have not heard from the government that they propose to do anything other than cut these programs. Unless new funds are appropriated&mdash;and they have to make a decision to do it&mdash;programs to prevent industrial pollution, to combat feral animal and weed proliferation, and to protect nature reserves, to name but a few, will all be without operating funds. We have not heard a whisper from the minister. Over $40 million that goes on these programs will be lost in a full year, and that is before we get to the question of what they will do when it comes to the budget later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Landcare projects, much loved by the rural community and supported by the government when in opposition, will be reduced by approximately $20 million in this year alone. Over the four years, without any new appropriations&mdash;and leaving aside the question of additional funds allegedly provided from the sale of Telstra&mdash;there will be a $200 million reduction. So before we get to this grand new fund which is supposed to provide $700 million in additional expenditure, we will be going backwards by at least $200 million. That is not to mention proposals to cut the Environmental Protection Authority and other programs within the environmental protection area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Revised forward estimates to fund the former government's forward looking land package worth some $460.7 million and to ensure the continuation of current programs beyond the 30 June deadline are not to be funded, apparently. So there are no forward estimates. Programs that finish on 30 June will disappear. That is a loss of at least $200 million over the next four years, and yet they are telling us that they take the environment seriously as a priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that initiatives to maintain and expand landcare, to rehabilitate the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin, to expand the national reserve system, to protect endangered species, and to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1589"> further fund programs for vegetation enhancement and improvement of water quality and river systems will simply not be funded. So do not worry about this argument about Telstra. They are going to be cutting back ahead of any proposals of that kind. As I say, that is bound to fail, given that all the parties indicated before the election and before the link with the environment program that it would not be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to another area for which I have responsibility in opposition, and that is women's programs. Recent reports suggest&mdash;and it has not been repudiated anywhere&mdash;that the government is proposing to reduce the funding and operations of the Office of the Status of Women by as much as 40 per cent. It is a tiny office anyway. The government has not contradicted reports that these cuts will result in the abolition of anything other than policy development roles. So all the programs will go out the window. That is a change that would, for instance, threaten the domestic violence programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am stunned by the hypocrisy of this. In the light of the horrific events in Tasmania and continuing severe problems with domestic violence in Australia, the notion that anti&hyphen;violence programs should be reduced and that that is justified is grotesque. The Office of the Status of Women has been responsible, and solely responsible, for the very successful national domestic violence program, including the national and community education campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government first tackled this issue in a coordinated fashion following a survey of attitudes towards domestic violence and concerns about continuing evidence that violence towards women was still endemic in our society. Yet this is the program that is to be thrown out the window. In relation to the debate about violence and gun ownership, there is clear evidence that a high proportion of firearm related homicides occur within the family&mdash;indeed, by far and away the majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For women victims, one study of gun deaths in Brisbane found that 89 per cent were killed by family members or friends and in their own homes. Almost all the homicides were committed by a male. Australia has, to date, been in the forefront in moving to change community attitudes towards rape and violence against women through government programs and legislation designed to raise the status of women and to eliminate violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We played a very significant role in drafting the declaration on the elimination of violence against women which was endorsed by the UN General Assembly last year. The Commonwealth community education program, Stop Violence Against Women, has already had very significant and measurable effects on community attitudes, and yet we are told this program will be cut. This national effort will be diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very concerned by reports&mdash;and they have not been denied by the government&mdash;that various grants to women's organisations will also not be funded. They run out on 30 June. Nothing we have heard from the government suggests that it proposes to do anything to continue them. Indeed, women's organisations have had a great deal of difficulty getting to meet the minister now responsible for the status of women, Senator Newman. She has refused, as I understand, to meet with most of the groups. They have been told she will meet with them in a round table discussion. Their funds run out on 30 June. They do not know whether they will be funded the relatively small total of $1 million in total for the next financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The grants to women's organisations include grants, for instance, to the Coalition of Australian Participating Organisations of Women, a group which did an enormous amount of work in the lead&hyphen;up to the Beijing conference, and our participation led us to be proud of Australian women. Those grants support the Catholic Women's League, the Foundation for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1590"> Australian Agricultural Women, the National Council for the Single Mother and her Child, the National Council for Women of Australia, the National Women's Justice Coalition, and the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia. Many of these organisations fund staff. They do not know at this point whether they will be able to continue their programs, let alone continue paying their staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, Senator Newman has allowed these organisations to meet with some of her junior staffers, people who could not even give clear decisions on behalf of government. As recently as last night they were not able to give any news on funding until the budget but in the meantime, these organisations are running out of funds. There will be a winding down of facilities and staffing arrangements. They have been told that there might be some separation of general and core funding, but again, there are no details.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have been given no criteria for future funding, if indeed there is to be any and when the funding plans are finalised, they do not know the nature and extent of the cuts. It might be five per cent, 10 per cent, or even 100 per cent. That is an insult to women's organisations in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to comment briefly on a couple of changes that I have seen already in the way women are treated by this government. We have been asked to commend the government for the number of women who now represent them on the benches. I, for one, would want to do that, but I have to say that there have been some examples of government attitudes recently that give me cause for great dismay rather than joy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, today in the Senate, Senator Newman, with responsibility for the status of women in this country, when talking about the problems of the budget&mdash;some of which I have alluded to today&mdash;compared the behaviour of the previous Labor government in leaving what she said was a poor budget, to a woman who might be held accountable by her husband for a messy budget. Perhaps she was momentarily flustered but she repeated it so it cannot have been entirely ex tempore. She said that if a housewife let her household budget get into the same sort of mess as Labor allegedly had left the national budget, her husband would be entitled to send her packing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find that an extraordinary comment from the person who is supposed to represent the women of this community. When it was first outlined to me and I saw the early transcript, I could not believe it. I thought that it was a joke, that it actually had not happened. There must have been some mistake. This woman is supposed to understand that in 1996 Australian women do not regard themselves as chattels to be thrown out the door when they make a mistake. They do not regard themselves as victims or as second&hyphen;class citizens. What have we spent the last 20 years, 30 years, or 40 years doing if not improving the status of women in this country, insisting that we not be treated and discussed in that way? Yet here we have the minister responsible for the status of women in this country describing women in terms that clearly suggest that they are second&hyphen;class citizens, that they are the chattels of their husbands and that they can be thrown out the door if they bring in a messy household budget. I hesitate to speculate on what she might think if they did something worse than that in the eyes of the husband who is allegedly the power and authority in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But one of the things that I must say about this is that it is now not unique. In the House the other day, the Leader of the House described a woman on our side&mdash;she is not in the parliament but, nonetheless, she is a woman active in politics&mdash;as a girl. She had become adolescent and juvenile, although she is well and truly into her twenties&mdash;maybe even into her <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1591"> thirties. I have also understood from recent sources in government that the Prime Minister now says that we are not allowed to refer to anything other than `chairmen', that we have a new political correctness. Officers in the Status of Women and some of the Prime Minister's other departments have been told, `You are not allowed to use that phrase, even if it is your preferred mode. You have to talk about chairmen or a chairman. You cannot talk about a chairperson.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incidentally, I think that it is worth saying that there have been other reports of that kind from departments formerly under my control in the area of health. A senior officer, when told that senior executive women in the department did not want to participate in drinks after work on the grounds that they had family and other responsibilities, and in any case it was socially irresponsible to drink before driving, told them that they should go off and hold a craft afternoon for the members of staff in that office. The leadership from the government, starting from the minister responsible for the status of women, is clearly not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the new political correctness is, clearly, that women are to be seen as second&hyphen;class citizens. Every time there is an example of this sort of behaviour and thinking, I for one will draw it to the attention of the parliament and protest vigorously. I have tonight called upon Senator Newman&mdash;and I know I am not alone in this&mdash;to apologise not just to her parliamentary colleagues but to all of the women of Australia, whether they are in marriage or not; whether they are in partnerships or not. They are not the chattels of their partners and husbands, and should not be regarded in that way.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(8.20 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I talk to the committee this evening about a couple of major issues in my portfolio area of science and information technology. In particular, I think the most critical issue I bring before the House and to its attention is our role in relation to membership of the European Southern Observatory. This is a major scientific project. Indeed, it could be said to be one of Australia's current big science projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the world countries with resources, countries in the First World&mdash;the developed world&mdash;look towards the addition to humankind's knowledge of what is in the universe and how it all began. They do this through a number of projects which are often described as `big science'. These, of course, often come with large price tags. Examples of these would be the superconducting supercollider in the United States and the fusion reactor prototypes which have been developed in the United States and Russia. Other major countries have contributed to those projects as well. They usually have very substantial price tags&mdash;hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in most cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But those projects seek to resolve some of the fundamental questions of the universe: the origin of our universe in time, how the universe developed, and processes which go right to the very fundamental understanding of space and time. Those questions, of course, are not ones which contribute to our economic wellbeing in an immediate sense&mdash;and I do not begin to suggest that our membership of the European Southern Observatory would either, except in a short&hyphen;term way. But those questions do need to be addressed. They are issues which have always attracted the attention of our race. Every since people turned their eyes first to the stars, those questions of the origin of the universe and the like have intrigued us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote from the document which was submitted by the Australian astronomers, the large telescope working party of the National Committee on Astronomy. This document was prepared by a group of interested astronomers in academia who then presented it to the government when this issue was first in contention. They begin their presentation with a quotation from George Ellery Hale, who lived from 1868 to 1938. He said: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1592">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like buried treasures the outposts of the Universe have beckoned to the adventurous from immemorial times.</PARA>
<PARA>And that is certainly the case. Australians have often and competently responded to that call, one which I think has always been to the forefront of those who have an adventurous spirit; an adventurous mind. Australian astronomers have certainly been in those categories. We have a long and proud record of achievement in this area. It is one which I and my colleagues would have liked to see us continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the recent decision by the new government to discontinue negotiations for Australian membership of the European Southern Observatory has brought all of that to an end. Australia's proud record in the area of astronomy is very much threatened by this decision of the government not to proceed in relation to this very vital and important project. Australia was the first country outside of Europe to be invited to join the ESO Council. Our reputation in international circles is such that we were invited to join with other European countries in this magnificent undertaking in Chile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The European countries&mdash;and this group, by the way, excludes the United Kingdom in this context but does include Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden&mdash;have always formed a consortium to ensure that work of this nature goes ahead. It has been in operation since about 1965. The site in Chile where the new telescope array will be built has, in fact, been in active use by the European Southern Observatory countries for observations for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of Australia being invited to join this consortium cannot be understated. It is not only based on our achievements in the past but also based on their assessment of our potential to achieve in the future. That speaks volumes for the work of Australian astronomers and it is indeed an indictment on the short&hyphen;sighted attitudes of the new government which dictate that immediate budget concerns, which are debateable of themselves, must be put to the forefront. Australia's long&hyphen;term reputation and its whole scientific credibility throughout the world is to be threatened by those short&hyphen;term considerations. I would like to demonstrate this evening that those short&hyphen;sighted attitudes are not only a threat to our position in science but also very bad economics for this country in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The European Southern Observatory is a vital project to astronomy. It permits us to see further back in time than ever before. Madam Deputy Speaker, as you would realise, as we turn our eyes to the heavens through more and more powerful telescopes, we are looking back in time. At the moment, we are able to see back to about half the age of the universe. By looking further and further beyond those limits, we effectively look back into space. That is not particularly relevant, although it might be interesting. The important part is that we are able to look back in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The light from more distant objects takes much longer to reach the earth. Therefore, in effect, we are seeing a snapshot of the universe at ages billions and billions of years ago. We can therefore follow its evolution, its progress, its development over time. Theoretically, by working back to the point of origin, we can make some very strong deductions about the origin of the universe, how it came about and what its processes of evolution are. There can be few more fundamental questions about our very existence than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increasing size of telescopes brings with it increasing costs. That is why people have combined together in consortia like the ESO, the European Southern Observatory, in order to ensure that those costs are spread amongst the developed countries who can afford those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1593"> kinds of projects. Australia's unique invitation to join would have come with a price tag of approximately $30 million, but that was one which was eminently negotiable by the government. Indeed, the previous government had already commissioned a negotiating team to work with the council of the ESO to negotiate our entry fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regardless of what the final figure was precisely&mdash;the $30 million is a ballpark estimate, but it would not have been much in excess of that&mdash;it would have brought with it the opportunity to take part in the construction phase of the telescope itself. Some work has already been done, but many further tenders are to be called. That phase is very technical and sophisticated work, it is very high value added work and it is work in which Australia has substantial expertise. But perhaps the world is not yet as familiar with our expertise in these areas as we would like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Participation in a project like the ESO allows us to showcase our high technical standards in these and related electronics fields and ensures that the world is aware of the expertise and capability of Australian industry, as well as the expertise and science of Australian astronomers. By being able to negotiate in the way that the previous government had commissioned its team to do, we would probably have had a very strong chance of ensuring that much of that initial fee of approximately $30 million was returned to Australian industry through contracts and tenders on the balance of the construction work of this fine telescope, which is scheduled for completion around 1998 in Chile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why Chile? The site is a very obscure one, but it happens to be one of the finest sites in the world for viewing the heavens. The site is some 2,600 metres above ground. It is well inland&mdash;13 kilometres from the Pacific coast&mdash;and it offers uniquely good viewing. The air is particularly still. There is virtually no light pollution from surrounding development and astronomers are able to get perhaps their best possible glimpse of the heavens from that site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Southern Hemisphere has always been particularly vital to astronomy. Our nearest neighbours, the Magellanic Clouds, are visible particularly from the Southern Hemisphere. The galactic centre of our own galaxy is also principally visible from the Southern Hemisphere. It passes right overhead in the long nights of winter in the Southern Hemisphere and affords us very good viewing of the centre of our own galaxy, unlike the Northern Hemisphere, from where the galactic centre cannot be seen as well as it can from the Southern Hemisphere. That is why the European Southern Observatory was built at Chile and why it is particularly well suited to working with Australian astronomers who have always practised from the Southern Hemisphere. The combination of the two would have been a particularly powerful factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always had a very strong interest in astronomy, and I think the statistics bear that out. Australia has a very high percentage of astronomers per head of population. Indeed, we have one of the highest in the world; we rate well ahead of other comparable countries. The report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Membership of the European Southern Observatory</EMPHASIS>, to which I alluded earlier, contains statistics of the International Astronomical Union membership which show, for example, the Netherlands at 11 astronomers per million of population, Australia at 10, France at 10, the UK at nine, the USA at eight, and other countries such as Germany, Canada, Italy, Spain, Japan, China and India well below those figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has a very strong claim to fame in this area. It has a particularly strong commitment by its own domestic astronomers. They will now be greatly disappointed by this government's failure to seize the initiative in relation to the ESO. It is not only a disappointment to our astronomers but also to those people in industry who would have been </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1594">
<PARA>able to participate in this project. It would have allowed them to develop further their own expertise. Not only is the scientific loss enormous but also the economic loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This attitude equates to the government's attitude in a number of other areas. We only need to look at the state of science in Australia a few short months after this government came to power to see just what I mean. Although the new Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) was very keen to issue press releases shortly after he took office, confirming his election commitments in relation to science, those commitments have very quickly gone the way of the commitment of Senator Hill to the European Southern Observatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that was the first election promise to be broken by the government in the science area. Senator Hill, as the previous opposition's science spokesman, had committed his party to the ESO just before the election, and it was not very long after the election that that commitment was broken. Indeed, I think that would have to rate as the first and possibly the most serious breach of faith by this government in relation to our scientific community. It is such a serious issue that it will stand as a record for the balance of this government's term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What other areas are in doubt in science? Quite clearly the whole budget is in doubt in that regard. The CSIRO, which was promised an extra $20 million by this government when it was in opposition, is now faced with $2 million to $3 million budget cuts, and even the extra $20 million which they were promised is now in doubt. So, not only do they not receive their $20 million as promised but also they will definitely incur a $2 million budget cut, which will certainly leave the organisation seriously underfunded, and a further election promise will be broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other organisations such as ANSTO&mdash;the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation&mdash;and the Institute of Marine Science also face similar cuts to those which are threatened for CSIRO. Although the government might choose to describe them as efficiency cuts, in scientific research organisations already cut to the bone and already operating on a minimum budget, you will find that this will be the end of any opportunity for these organisations to move forward in any serious way that would benefit Australia as a community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also doubts about the Cooperative Research Centre fifth round: some $11 million is in doubt there. This will threaten the very basis of our important CRC program. Australia has established a substantial precedent in that area: a combination of public and private sector resources which we have not seen in this country to date. The CRC undertaking is a very important one for this country. It brings the private and public resources together and engages scientists around the country on active duty on behalf of science in this country, not only for industrial ends but also for pure scientific ends. That is at risk if the program is not continued through the fifth and subsequent rounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps one of the most vital matters in that area is the research and development tax concession scheme. That has been at 150 per cent of eligible expenditure for some years now and it has driven significant increases in industrial expenditure on research and development in this country. We did lag behind in the past, our effort could still be improved, but the research and development tax concession put in place by the Labor government some years ago has been a vital factor in driving increased research and development expenditure in the private sector. That expenditure will bring gains in the long term, as all of these things will. That is under threat by this government. Despite their election rhetoric to the contrary, I am confident that we will see that very valuable scheme cut.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1595">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerning the Australian Research Council, $130 million over three years, where is that now? The council is in doubt of its funding commitment and I am sure that its doubts are very real and proper. Concerning the Chief Scientist, Professor Pitman has been asked to stay on in an honorary capacity with only his expenses being met. I understand that no decision has yet been taken on a replacement to hold his very significant office in Australian science and which provides advice to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already the scientific community is concerned about the way in which positions that were formerly reporting to the Prime Minister have now been moved to the department, to DIST itself. Indeed, the very position of Chief Scientist is under threat in the context of this government's mania to cut the immediate budget expenditure. Those are very serious issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also see the reduction of a number of other important programs which have contributed towards Australia's research and development and industrial technology base. Telecommunications and information technology are vital things for Australia's future, for our place in the Asia Pacific region. But what does this government do? It takes the first possible opportunity that it can to ensure that those funds which support those programs are also cut. The export market development grant scheme and the DIFF scheme are under severe threat already. Of course, that will undermine the work of the telecommunications industry and the information technology industry to boost Australia's exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen our electronics industry grow in this country from very small beginnings to a major and very substantial industry. I believe that if the government continues on its present course it will seriously undermine the potential for these industries to be part of our export led push into the Asia Pacific region to ensure that we are able to balance our domestic industry with a sound export base and ensure the growth of jobs in this vital information sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had enough discussion this week in the House of Representatives about the worth of certain noted American authors and the way in which that influences the thinking of Australian parliamentarians&mdash;some more than others. Indeed, the report which was circulated originally last year by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), the noted former chairman of the Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies did indeed highlight the way in which we are moving firmly and strongly into an information age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will take another opportunity to relate to the House the damage which this government has already done to the information technology industry. Quite clearly, if the government's attack on science which we have seen to date in only three short months is continued with similar vigour into the balance of its parliamentary term, I think we will see that area as well under significant threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has recently been seeking to shore up his position with the information technology industry. He has been meeting with the council of that industry to promise support and future growth in that area. However, the government's first decision was to take one billion dollars out of the capital growth of that industry by withdrawing government purchases over the next three years. That will seriously undermine our domestic production base. It is the work of the public sector which has underpinned the growth of the electronics and information industries in the past and while we would hope that a situation will arrive in the future where those industries can be completely self&hyphen;sustaining without government contracts and purchases, the reality is that it is the public sector which has funded the growth in those industries. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1596">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telecom was a vital part in the growth of the telecommunications industry in this country. Without its direction, without its purchasing power, without its commitment to Australian industry we would never have seen the growth in telecommunications equipment that we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same is true of government purchases of IT. They are purchased in the marketplace. They are purchased by open tender, usually. The reality is that the firm base of government driving innovation and domestic production has led to the industry thriving and led to it developing a sound export base. The sudden withdrawal of those through the reduction in government expenditure by one billion dollars in three years, by the privatisation of Telecom, will threaten all that we have done in the past and the very foundation of Australian science and our technology industries will be under threat. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(8.40 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a wide ranging debate and I will attempt to cover a few areas of concern in my electorate. Some weeks ago, in response to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  report of the formation of a coalition of the major universities in this country on funding, I put out a press release because of my concern that the strength of this group&mdash;their contacts, `the old boys network'&mdash;would ensure that they would be a very decisive player in tertiary funding, at the expense of institutions such as the University of Western Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in the interim, the picture has changed very dramatically. The actions of the federal minister are such that the group is totally united now in their common opposition to various serious cutbacks. Whether it is the students, the teachers, the academics or the chancellors&mdash;they all have very grave concerns about the situation. In a report by Mark Abernethy in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, Dr Carolyn Allport, NTEU president, makes the comment that the minister had stepped into her new portfolio seemingly ignorant of the history of funding cuts already forced on universities over the past decade. A fairly monstrous cut is intended to do in one year what there have been some suggestions the previous government would do in three years. As that person makes clear, they had enough problems with the previous suggestions, let alone this one from the new minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that Professor Schreuder from the University of Western Sydney has put out a very strong statement with regard to this matter. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The University was created&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the University of Western Sydney&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">specifically to serve the people of the region, and any cut to its funding will be detrimental at best and catastrophic at worst . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Schreuder further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over 65% of our 23,000 students come from Greater Western Sydney, a region traditionally under&hyphen;resourced in higher education; we have 40% of Sydney's population, but whereas the rest of Sydney can offer 32 university places for every 1,000 inhabitants, in the West we can only offer eight places.</PARA>
<PARA>We can see that there has been deprivation. We can see the results of the idiotic policies of the previous state Liberal government and the federal sphere when they created the University of Macquarie, distant from public transport, on the North Shore, and with no reasonable access to most of Sydney. The Labor government has moved in the other direction to ensure that the area which essentially covers 40 per cent of Sydney has a university with a number of campuses which have reasonable access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my point of view, my electorate is not as affected as much by this as other electorates such as Greenway, Lindsay and others further west. The rail system gives reasonable access <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1597"> to Sydney University. However, there is a disproportionate number of students still going to this university and it is a matter of concern. We are looking at a situation where this university is going to suffer grave problems. There is a very big question mark over the previous government's suggestion&mdash;the very intelligent decision&mdash;to utilise the previous Rydalmere mental institution. That could be used for a fairly attractive and expansionary sector to that university. This is a matter of grave concern to the whole region. It certainly represents a very big problem for the Parramatta electorate. That university campus would have had an impact on the provision of a wide range of facilities to the general public. It would have had an impact in suburbs such as Harris Park and Granville with regard to housing and, of course, it would have been very accessible to students from there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter I want to speak about is the government's decision to essentially move away from the building better cities project. My electorate has gained, in a very real sense, through the rail link between Merrylands and Harris Park. It overcomes the ridiculous situation we have at the moment whereby hundreds and hundreds of people are racing past each other across platforms, knocking each other over to change trains at Granville. It will provide very important changes to our transportation system, giving access to people on the western line and the Liverpool line to both Liverpool and Parramatta, which are major employment centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that when you have access to jobs, you are more likely to get those jobs. My electorate has amongst the worst unemployment problems in this country, and certainly in metropolitan Sydney. So that program, in a very concrete sense, helped my electorate. I think we are aware that it was also instrumental in innovative projects relating to housing, the inter&hyphen;relationship of housing to public transport, the possibilities of using construction both for areas like solar energy and for exports in the housing sector. So once again, this is a change which has a very decisive impact on my electorate. I congratulate the government on the Y&hyphen;link rail link and also on the work it has done at both Blacktown and Parramatta stations&mdash;the interchange for buses at Parramatta, and I think anyone would concede, regardless of politics, the very major improvements at Blacktown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next matter I want to speak about is the question of the TCFU 2000 development project. That is essentially a project of the previous government in relation to outworkers. We have heard a lot of rhetoric from the other side as to their very worried feelings about female wages in this country. The other day a minister lamented the fact that female rates in this country are below male rates. She somehow forgot to mention that the differentiation between male and female rates in this country is lower than in any country in the European Union or the OECD. So in reality, there is a differential, as there historically has been, but because of the centralised wage system in this country, we have managed to ensure that despite their vulnerability, despite the fact that they are in casualised industries, predominantly in the service and unorganised sectors, despite that organisational problem, despite that reality, female wage rates in this country are closer to male rates than in any of those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am now talking about an essential activity of the previous government&mdash;the outworkers project. It was interesting to watch a television program recently which explored some of the realities of the textile industry in this country&mdash;70 per cent of employees not being in the tax system and therefore vulnerable to further exploitation because of concerns that they might be exposed, and probably initially persuaded by the employer or the contractor not to be in the tax system. The vast majority are not registered for Workcover. There was the instance of an eight&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child lamenting the fact that he was extremely tired after completing his schooling each day. In regard to one company, the rate for shirts had been decreased from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1598"> $2.20 to $2.10. There was the company called New Trends that essentially had organised that wage reduction and said basically, `Take it or leave it'. There was the instance of people working about 100 hours a week to receive $400. There was the instance, in a very real commercial sense, of Country Road, a major company in this country, getting products for $14 to $27 and selling them for $69 to $189.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the reality out there. The previous government chose, through a project, to try to bring these people into the system, to reassure them, to support them, to make sure that they had an opportunity to be paid award rates, to be legitimate in regard to taxation and thereby to get protection on safety and other matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an article in the magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Workplace</EMPHASIS> in the winter of 1995 by Michael Gleeson entitled `Slaves of fashion'. It spoke of an estimated 300,000 outworkers in this country living in `Third World conditions in Australia's First World economy'. It was stated that many worked for 24&hyphen;hour stretches to finish orders; almost all worked seven days a week for an average of $2.50 an hour. We all know that regardless of the difficulties in the previous industrial system, they are going to be much more prevalent when these protections are basically destroyed. This effort by the previous government in funding the textile union to try to do something about it has gone down the drain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that some of these grants to the trade union movement are debatable. If we are honest about it in the political sense, one could allege they are granted for partisan reasons and one could allege that some of them are for contributions to the Labor Party and so on. That can often be argued, but I do not think there is any argument whatsoever about there being very serious problems in this industry and the efforts being made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had correspondence from the Women's Health in Industry Association in New South Wales asking me to strongly take up this matter. There might be a belief on the other side of politics that Australia is uncompetitive, that our wage rates are too high and that we should basically deregulate and force down wages and thereby be more competitive, but what we are seeing in this industry is already a very concrete problem. The decision to cut out funding for this project means that we are seeing the reality: when this project is cut out, when assistance to the union movement is cut out, it will not be replaced by any effort by the department of labour. Essentially, we are going to see a lack of interest, a lack of aggression, a lack of activity.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am talking about the export market development grants scheme. I was on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. The former member for Wills and I had to be dragged screaming to support the majority position that these grants <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1599"> should be extended to single providers in the tourist industry because, under the previous scheme, there were obvious abuses that all parties conceded were actually limited to companies that provided accommodation, transport and outings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry, science and technology committee made the unanimous recommendation that those grants should be extended, and that is what occurred unanimously through this parliament. So it is ironic that we now see this rush essentially to throw them out the door to save $750 million over the next three years because a wide variety of diverse industry representatives and a large number of commentators have said that it is all right to talk about reduction, but maybe it is worth while thinking about the impact.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, amongst those organisations and individuals I quote is the Australian Information Industry Association. In their bulletin of 5 May, they stated that the EMDGs are the only financial support available for most IT&amp;T exporters. Small exporters will be particularly affected as 70 per cent of EMDGs' grants go to companies with fewer than 25 staff. The bulletin went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this is disappointing as the government made an election promise not to cut EMDG. Abolition seriously threatens the spectacular growth achieved in IT&amp;T exports in recent years . . . we are unlikely to reach our target of $A10 billion in export reserves.</PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  of 30 April, Peter Roberts commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry Minister, John Moore, says business needs to share the pain with the rest of the community and should rely less on government. This hides his responsibility to develop comprehensive industry policies to further the globalisation of the economy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and, of course, we all know that that particular minister went on the record as saying that from a policy point of view, it is stupid, but he has got a fiscal gun at his head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 20 May, Kenneth Davison similarly commented that this was obviously a `silly expenditure cutting proposal'. It hurts, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . mainly small companies, the sector that Mr Howard claimed in the election would be the main engine of economic growth into the new millennium.</PARA>
<PARA>No less a source than Allen Hanberg of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  of 23 April made a few comments. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we understand the need to review and assess these programs but it must be a genuine review and a genuine assessment . . . If it's going to be a case of here's a $20 million program, let's slash it, then we would vehemently oppose that approval.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review&mdash;</EMPHASIS> not Mr Hanberg&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Moore's office could not shed any light on which programs would be trimmed or axed altogether.</PARA>
<PARA>So we do have a very substantial body of opinion saying that EMDG programs are worthwhile. We have the record of parliamentary committees, including that in which you serve, Mr Deputy Speaker, saying that this has been a worthwhile project. We have had a public examination that shows that $9 is gained by Australian exporters for every dollar of government expenditure&mdash;that was from a 1994 review of this scheme. Similarly, it also noted in the same investigation that 70 per cent of the people who received this grant were in small business. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1600">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have quoted manufacturers, employers, financial commentators and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures. I dare to quote the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. Now they are in the same basket with similar comments. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> in an article by Mike Taylor they commented that $4.5 billion of import replacement and export expansion opportunities could go down the drain with this policy decision. They said that it could cost this country 80,000 jobs by the year 2001. They noted the possibility that there will be fewer new exporters and that existing innovators would probably not make the effort. They talked of fewer firms bothering to network and of a declining interest in new technology. And they talked, of course, of infrastructure projects not being followed through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers in my electorate, which historically has included a significant manufacturing base aligned to the presence of the railway field and also newer IT&amp;T companies, have written to me expressing grave concerns about the decision of this government to get rid of the EMDGs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, with DIFF funding we are seeing an ill&hyphen;conceived, ill thought out decision to basically cut. From my own experience on the foreign affairs committee and from a number of investigations that we have conducted into relations with countries like Thailand and Indonesia, the reality is that Australia needs DIFF funding. Our companies need it to be competitive with European companies which, essentially, get even greater assistance. A number of parliamentary committees have decided unanimously, not on a partisan basis, that this is a worthwhile scheme and have actually suggested its extension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen examples recently, whether it is Transfield with their boat project in the Philippines or projects for the provision of solar energy, which has long&hyphen;term export potential for this country, such as a project for rural villages in the Philippines. We have seen the Chinese government come out on the record, with the Embassy of China actually issuing a public statement about their concerns that Australia would no longer be regarded as a reliable country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we essentially have here is a policy where the assistance to Australian companies has to meet international requirements. Australia cannot just have a funding arrangement which is regarded as financially discriminatory in relation to contracts overseas. We have a wide range of people essentially saying that it is not beneficial. Finally, we have the research and development concession coming under severe attack as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, taken all round, not only do we have the obvious attack on social security in this country, but there is also the attempt to deregulate the labour market in the forlorn hope that if you reduce wages to low enough levels we might be competitive&mdash;that if we replicate the situation we already have with outworkers in the textile industry, we will be competitive. At the same time, this government is monstrously cutting a variety of areas of assistance to exporters. That decision has been widely attacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw a letter the other day from a person in a small private company who said they had been so hopeful that the Liberals would win the last election and who talked about their personal experience, their dependence upon export market development grants and their great disillusionment with what has happened. So there are a number of serious suggestions in regard to exporters in this country. They will impact on my electorate and they will impact on employment in an area which already has one of the relatively worst situations in Sydney.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our consideration of these supply bills illustrates better than most other things the vagaries of the political process. It was only 21 years ago when, later in the calendar year, the consideration of similar supply bills brought <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1601"> on one of the most significant and important political crises that Australia had experienced. Arising from that there was, on 11 November that year, a change of government under fairly dramatic circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that, on this occasion, there will not be a similar occurrence says nothing about the quality of the government, or about the tactics of the opposition. It simply indicates that we live, perhaps, in more placid times. But it is important for us to realise that the supply bills that we give consideration to now are part of the necessary mechanism to ensure that the funds for government and government programs are made available. That is what we are doing at the present time. And the central reason why Deputy Speakers display the sort of tolerance that you do, Mr Deputy Speaker, to enable members to range so widely across issues is because we are dealing with funds which are necessary for the government to operate and for programs to be implemented. For that reason it is appropriate that the Speaker and his assistants such as yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, allow those wide&hyphen;ranging considerations to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to emphasise at the outset, though, that the process of our providing funds of this kind for the government says nothing about how secure or stable, or how long lasting, we would necessarily believe this government will be. I think it is perfectly appropriate for members of the government, and supporters of the government who sit on the government benches, to indicate their pleasure at achieving such a substantial win on the 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition came in after Labor had occupied the treasury bench for 13 years. We were defeated, having exercised a majority of 11. The new government which came in on 2 March occupies the treasury bench with a majority of 40. So it is quite appropriate for you to enjoy the euphoria associated with that change. But I have heard others say that if some of the new members who have come to Canberra have been given the opportunity to either take leave or resign their job, they should take leave. If, in Canberra, they are trying to decide whether they will buy a unit or rent accommodation, they should decide to rent accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the opportunity earlier today to give some of the reasons why I believe that advice is appropriate. One of the reasons is that while the government has such a very substantial majority of 40, on 2 March the government won 54 votes out of every 100. The opposition won 46. The opposition won 46 per cent of the vote on 2 March and got about 32 per cent of the seats. I said earlier today that I make no complaint about that. I do not take umbrage at that; that is the way the system operates when you have a large number of marginal electorates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that is the present government's situation&mdash;a very large number of marginal electorates. In fact, Mr Deputy Speaker, you saw the results in New South Wales. There were swings last Saturday in New South Wales in some of those electorates of between 12 and over 20 per cent.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nearly 16 per cent in some cases. The present opposition, the former government, only needs a swing of less than four per cent to get back into government. If, when the next election is held, in whatever context, there is a swing of five per cent, the Labor Party will be back in government with a majority of 16 seats. There has only been one occasion since the end of the Second World War when there has been a change of government in Australia where the swing against the incumbent government, or towards the opposition, has been less than four per cent, and that was in 1972. On every other occasion the swing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1602"> against the incumbent government has been in excess of four per cent. We do not need even four per cent to re&hyphen;win government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people to whom I would give that very special advice&mdash;don't resign, take leave; and don't buy a unit, rent&mdash;would include the following people. Mr Deputy Speaker, as I move around this pendulum, it could well be that I would refer to one of those very significant provincial seats in Victoria which you represent. Let me indicate which ones they are: the Northern Territory, Paterson, Canning, Lilley, the next is one I hesitate to announce&mdash;Bendigo, Bowman, Makin, La Trobe, Griffith, Lindsay, Kingston, McMillan, McEwen, Cowan, Lowe, Deakin, Chisholm, Dickson, Dunkley, Adelaide, Robertson, Capricornia, Ballarat, Swan, and Parramatta. When the four per cent comes to us, as it will, those seats will go. You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as do some of your colleagues, that I say that with good will. But when that swing occurs, they will go, as sure as I stand here. If the swing reaches five per cent, let me add to the list: Leichhardt, Page, Bass, Oxley, Eden&hyphen;Monaro and Hughes. Very, very formidable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How insecure must those people be in the light of the results which occurred in New South Wales last Saturday just how volatile the electorate has become, how demanding the electorate has become. It certainly is&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, especially the National Party. I appreciate the interjection of my friend and colleague, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford). Mr Deputy Speaker, could I say that you may have cause to feel a little more secure, marginally more secure, than some of your National Party colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly too, since the last election&mdash;and this is important when we are dealing with the question of supply of funds to maintain the programs of the government&mdash;the government has persistently referred to the size of its mandate. The government has made the claim that it has secured a mandate in the House of Representatives. I have no argument with that, of course the government did, the government has a majority of 40 seats. The government has a majority in the House of Representatives. But the Democrats in the Senate secured 1.1 million votes. In fact, there were 2&half; million voters who voted for the coalition in the House of Representatives who did not vote for the coalition in the Senate. We may well ask ourselves why. The reason is apparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no argument with the suggestion that the electorate endorsed the coalition in the House of Representatives where governments are made and unmade for it to form a government. But equally I have no argument with the suggestion, particularly on the part of the Democrats, that the Australian electors collectively exercised their judgment in such a way as to constrain the government in the possible excess exercise of the power that it was given in the House of Representatives. There is no question about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People can complain about that. I know that some supporters of the government have referred to it as a quirk of the electoral system. Perhaps it was also a quirk of the electoral system that enabled us to win 46 per cent of the votes in the House of Representatives but only 32 per cent of the seats. But we accept the collective judgment of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some other points that have been made as well. On the question of the $8 billion black hole which the government claims it inherited, I want to refer to some comments that were made by Bernie Fraser, the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Bernie Fraser <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1603"> said on 28 March that the Treasury forecast was subject to further change and that with economic growth in 1996&hyphen;97 expected to be stronger than the earlier forecast of 3.25 per cent, the starting point deficit should be lower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who in the early 1980s was the Treasurer in the Fraser government, is on the record as having made a similar observation, that not a great deal of confidence could be placed in those forward estimates. When in the lead&hyphen;up to the election, spokesmen for the then government made the claim that not a great deal of light could be thrown on the national government's fiscal position by referring to some of those forward estimates, the simple fact is that they were right. They were saying no more nor less than what the present Prime Minister was saying in the early 1980s. They were saying no more nor less than what Mr Bernie Fraser, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, said towards the end of March this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of those observations should be made, especially in the context of those circumstances where an intervening election campaign and a change of government have taken place. It is now apparent that in the election campaign the coalition over&hyphen;estimated the savings measures inherent in the policy that it was presenting to the electorate and underestimated the cost of its new spending commitments. In fact, it amounts to a $1.2 billion gap, as far as its savings and revenue measures are concerned. There is also an additional $3.3 billion where Treasury has indicated that insufficient information was provided for it to make any sensible assessment. The result, as we know, is that there is up to a $4 billion blow&hyphen;out in the budget deficit because of this government's dishonesty in the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not make any claims that have not been made by others. I make no claims that cannot be substantiated. That happens to be the position. Why the government now should continue to run with the claims that it has been making, I do not know. I do not believe that the Australian electorate is as lacking in the capacity to make judgments about issues of that kind as the present government would believe. The government has claimed a commitment to honesty, to open government. If that is the position then why, in the light of all of those other financial and fiscal disclosures, is it that the present government will not release, and has persistently refused to release, the Department of Finance advice about the real potential costs of its election promises?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the tactics that were adopted by the government in the lead&hyphen;up to the election were very astute and politically very clever. I understand that the Prime Minister said to the member for Kooyong, Mr Petro Georgiou, `Petro, will you provide me with a brief statement about what you believe our tactics should be in the context of this coming election.' He asked for a brief statement, Petro Georgiou provided him with 36 pages of detailed analysis, it was followed to a T, and it worked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be more prepared to accept the claim that a mandate exists for this government to introduce its policies if I were convinced, and if I had seen evidence in the lead&hyphen;up to the election, that it had released its policies in time for the Australian electorate to absorb them, consider them, judge them and to then make a decision on the basis of them. Petro Georgiou, the member for Kooyong, advised the Prime Minister not to do that and the Prime Minister did not do that. As the election got closer, you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, as do I and all of our colleagues, that there was literally an avalanche of policies. The Australian electorate did not have the time to make the type of considered judgment that we would normally hope a national electorate should make.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1604">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about a mandate, I think the government needs to give some consideration to the legitimacy of that claim, and not just in the Senate where it does not have a majority, where non&hyphen;government members have a majority because of decisions&mdash;collective decisions&mdash;that were made by the electorate. Because of that strategy, and I do not make a great deal of this, I do not believe that the Australian electorate really had sufficient time to make the judgment that we would have preferred it make. Really, Mr Deputy Speaker, the lie was given to that budget black hole when the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, made this claim. Could I quote it perfectly, word for word.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If someone maintains a position, only one chink needs to be found to destroy that position&mdash;and there it is. The Deputy Prime Minister said that each and every cut should be known as the BKW cut because it arises from the actions of Beazley, Keating and Willis, and in the next breath he was forced to concede that at least one of those cuts was one which the coalition had announced before the election. We could compound examples of that kind over and over again.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some claims, Mr Deputy Speaker, have been made about the fiscal irresponsibility of the Labor government, I want to emphasise that for four years, during the 1980s, the Labor government ran a surplus for the first period of years in the history of the Federation, with a cumulative surplus of $18 billion&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we consider the government's supply bills, it is appropriate to consider where the policies of this government are likely to take our country. When I talk about the policies of the government, I am not just talking about the policies that were detailed in the election campaign, but rather the real agenda and policies which are starting to emerge now that the government has finally realised its ambitions of occupying the Treasury benches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know, during the election campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) told Australians that he wanted them to be relaxed about their society and about themselves. He <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1605"> made many reassuring promises. The most effective of these promises that calmed the fears of most voters about a coalition government involved retaining the majority of the social policies of the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard particularly stressed that his government would protect the vulnerable and the needy, and he stressed this again and again to the Australian public, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One group in the community that's not going to be hurt are the most vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA>What do we see emerging from this government's policies? We see attempts to radically alter the nature of Australian society, something which will drastically impact on the lives of most Australians and especially on the lives of the vulnerable and the needy, as we have seen with the Housing Assistance Bill that has just gone through in the other chamber. These policies, in my view, are driven by Liberal ideology about small government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government, Labor was forced to cope, it is true, with a period of unprecedented change. This change was both worldwide and, I think we would now accept, irresistible. It could not be ignored or locked out by erecting tariff walls or other manifestations of a siege mentality. The Labor government had to find policies to cope with this rapidly changing world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that Labor coped with this and managed it better than most other western democracies is apparent in the nature and type of society that the coalition government has inherited. It is true, and I would certainly be the first to admit, that we do have unacceptably high unemployment rates but, fortunately, they are not as high as other Western nations. It is true that there have been other undesirable and unacceptable outcomes of the need to restructure radically our manufacturing industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make tonight is that Labor at no time abandoned any part of the Australian people nor did it write them off as unfortunate but inevitable casualties of this change. Labor had a genuine commitment to the vulnerable and the needy and it kept that commitment. It introduced Medicare, strengthened family payments, and the social security safety net, strengthened commitments to award wages to protect lower income earners, acted on a commitment to reconciliation with indigenous Australians and introduced Working Nation to combat unemployment. These measures helped to insulate and protect Australian society from the worst excesses of the changes sweeping the globe and led to a comparatively good level&mdash;a very good level, in the circumstances&mdash;of social equity and cohesion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard promised to retain all of these measures in spirit, if not in their exact and precise form. But what do we see emerging? Firstly, we have the spurious promotion of the so&hyphen;called $8 billion shortfall, and the previous speaker has spoken about this. This is Treasurer Costello's attempt to con the Australian people into believing that this government has an excuse to go back on its pre&hyphen;election commitments to the Australian people. And who are the Australian people first in the firing line? Will the trust funds be adequately taxed? We have heard nothing of this. No; this government uses its desire to cut government spending&mdash;a desire for small government&mdash;as an excuse to slug the elderly, working families and the poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the budget cuts that seem to be emerging in my shadow portfolio for the Aged, Family and Community Services. Firstly, let us look at the emerging plight of older Australians under this government. The way governments behave is critical to the dignity, living standards, health and wellbeing of older people. If government supports for them are removed or weakened, it can have a devastating effect on their lives.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between 1991 and 2011, the population of Australians aged 65 years and over will grow at double the rate of the rest of our population. When Labor was in power, it had a commitment to increase federal funding to aged care: to improve the services offered and also to increase the capacity to cope with this increasing number of older Australians. Despite this evidence, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is in the process of transferring large areas of his health and community services portfolio to the states. He claims that this is in the interests of efficiency and, perhaps in his view of the world, that makes sense: cut costs by dumping the responsibility onto somebody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what happens to Australian society if this trend in irresponsible non&hyphen;government catches on? What if the states decide to off&hyphen;load their `inconvenient welfare and community obligations'? What if they try to pass them onto local government, other states or perhaps onto community welfare groups and organisations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the development of these practices in the United States and we should be able to learn from its terrible experience. A couple of weeks ago, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>, a very significant article detailed what happens to a society when the federal government shirks its responsibilities. The article gave graphic accounts of welfare recipients being offered&mdash;and this is for real&mdash;one&hyphen;way bus tickets if they left a particular state. It detailed services to the needy being deliberately reduced to a lowest common denominator. In a truly perverted reversal of economic rationalist logic, if services were reduced to a significantly paltry level, the needy would be encouraged to go elsewhere for assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is that the basis for what we see as the federalism of this government? Perhaps a trend has already begun here. I have seen reports in the press recently of the Northern Territory's Country Liberal Party government paying for a family in receipt of welfare to fly to Melbourne to live. Of course, aged care is but one of the types of support provided, especially for older Australians, in our community. In the last 10 years there has been a massive growth in the provision of services to allow older people to retain a degree of independence by being able to stay in their own homes and be supported by the home and community care program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When asked in the House on 7 May whether this government planned to honour its promise on funding for home and community care, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) refused to give any commitment, even though it is clearly set out in the government's policy documents. Rather, she taunted the older members of our community, those for whom she is supposed to provide care and protection, by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are going to have to just wait.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what she said to them!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope you have booked your tickets for the night of 20 August when the budget is brought down, because all the mysteries . . . will then be revealed.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very insensitive response. That question was asked of her as a consequence of the concerns of large numbers of organisations who represent older Australians. What are the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association, Aged Care Australia, the Melbourne City Mission and the many thousands of older Australians they represent going to think about that. We on this side of the house do expect to see some hard edge but I think that is fairly callous and insensitive. The minister and this government are condemning hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people to months of uncertainty. If the government is going to break its promises, it should come out and say so and put the community's mind at rest. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1607">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the rough treatment does not end there. One of the inevitable consequences of advancing years is an increased reliance on medications and pharmaceuticals. Older Australians do not take pharmaceuticals because they want to, or because they have a choice; they take them because they need to, and because they have been advised by doctors and pharmacists to take them. Yet we read in a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> article that this government is proposing that pensioners and war veterans would be paying up to 60 per cent more for prescription medicines. Apparently, it is proposed that the price pensioners pay for each prescription rise from the current $2.50 to $4, and that the pharmaceutical benefit scheme safety net rise from $140.40 to over $200. Today, as we well know, the Prime Minister refused to rule out this option. He refused to allay the fears of older Australians about these massive increases in the costs of absolutely necessary pharmaceuticals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is the case that elderly Australians are not the only ones in the community to face the prospect of serious threats to their standard of living as a result of this government's ideologically&hyphen;driven obsession with cutting spending and shedding jobs. Public housing tenants, all of whom rely on subsidised housing as a means of staying above the poverty line, are also in danger, as we have just seen in the bill that has gone through the house. Instead of providing three years of funding to the states, public housing departments are getting one year of funding. The states are going to have to come back next year and have another go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions to ministers about the motives for such moves just end up with the answer, `Oh, it is mere speculation'. But, of course, what the states know in the area of public housing, is that it is not mere speculation, they have been offered one year's funding, they have not been offered three years' worth of funding, and they know full well what this is going to mean to their public housing responsibilities. It seems that those states with conservative governments are prepared to do deals with this government against the long&hyphen;term interests of users of public housing, but we can only hope that there are some states that will hold out and get a better deal for public housing tenants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of grave concern to me is the cuts that are being proposed in the education budget. I mention this because cutting public education is also a basic tenet of conservative ideology and one that has also started to reap disastrous consequences for American society. A strong public education system provides a pathway for any member of our society to rise in economic status. It prevents people from being locked into a particular class or income group and, in my view, is a fundamental part of any democratic society. I am particularly concerned about what happens to a society when basic community services and rights such as education, public health and support for the aged are drastically reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the start of this speech I said that it was the social policies of the previous Labor governments that had made Australia a much better place to live in during the changes of the last decade or so. Now, just when we seem to be able to take part in economic growth again, this conservative government is starting to reveal its true nature. If the government proceeds with its budget cuts then we can only look to the example of the United States to see the kind of things that will be in store for our community. It is there that we see the cutting of services and the polarisation of incomes that has proceeded much further than here. There we find the economic and political gurus of the New Right that inspire this government's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the United States, polarisation of incomes has been replicated by polarisation of living areas&mdash;the wealthy in their guarded enclaves, the poor in run&hyphen;down inner city slums. In the US we see many signs of a society in partial disintegration&mdash;higher crime rates, larger prison <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1608"> populations, a greater frequency of crimes of violence and a high and increasing usage of hard drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also, and this is a very frightening thing for those of us in Australia at this time, the growth of the self-styled anti-government militias. That is another sign of the disintegration of democracy in that country that comes about because of the polarisation of income, because of the lack of basic community support. Voter turnout is at its lowest, newspaper readership is down, union membership has dramatically declined and Americans are no longer drawn to join community organisations in the way that once used to define their society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this latter point, the withdrawal from society, that I find the most disturbing. There seems to be the growth of a kind of fortress suburbia with frightened, lonely people huddled in front of their television sets and keeping behind locked gates and burglar alarms. Is that the sort of society that we are going to have if we are to see the cuts that are proposed to our social services? Is that the kind of society that this government is taking us towards?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my fear that if the coalition fails to adhere to its pre&hyphen;election policies which, as I said before, were basically the policies of the previous Labor government, if they insist on making dramatic, ideologically motivated cuts to social services, aged care, public housing and public education, then we will see the rise of the kinds of inequalities and social breakdown that are emerging in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly urge the government's budgetary strategists to reconsider their proposals at this important time in the budgetary process or else we will find that our community will face the American experience.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that it is important for us to focus both on the larger issues that have been referred to by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the smaller issues. And both on the large and small issues we find this government failing to meet the basic principle that was outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), a commitment to care for those who are least well off in the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is more, that failure to care is reflected in an insincerity which does little credit to the approach which was adopted by the then Leader of the Opposition in the run&hyphen;up to the election, when he took a position virtually holding a near mortgage on political integrity yet, in key areas, he gave what could be regarded only as false assurances of comfort to sections of the Australian community&mdash;amongst them, some of the most needy and most vulnerable&mdash;assurances which have been breached deliberately and wilfully, now that the government is in office. As the Prime Minister himself said, again in a pre&hyphen;election context, nothing so undermines confidence in the democratic system as the cynical repudiation of election commitments by an incoming administration immediately upon obtaining office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now have the responsibility for the opposition of representing the portfolio of immigration and in assisting the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) with respect to ethnic affairs. In that area, as in so many others, the record of the government to date has been one which could only make many of the people who relied on its undertakings prior to the election sick in the guts. Why is that? It is because in three key areas there have been what anyone would regard as a cynical repudiation of pre&hyphen;election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first area of repudiation turns on a guarantee with respect to immigrant intake that the humanitarian and refugee program would be maintained and protected. This was an explicit commitment made both by the Prime Minister and by the then opposition spokesperson for immigration, Senator Short. The commitment was to protect the humanitarian program and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1609"> it was an express commitment not to reduce the numbers for the refugee component. But when, in a debate with the then minister for immigration with respect to the humanitarian program, Senator Bolkus asked Senator Short whether the same undertaking not to reduce in numerical terms the refugee component would also apply to the broader humanitarian component, Senator Short gave that assurance. We had both explicit and implicit undertakings that these components of the program would be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The baseline program that the government had established was 13,000 immigrants for the humanitarian program and 4,000 for the refugee component of it. In the year immediately preceding our leaving government, we had actually increased the humanitarian and refugee program to 15,000 as a result of requests made to the Australian government by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Any responsible and reasonable citizen understanding and listening to the assurances given by the then Leader of the Opposition and his spokesman would have understood those assurances to mean that at least 13,000 humanitarian program immigrants would be maintained and that at least 4,000 refugees would be admitted to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we understand from leaked cabinet documents that these programs will be cut. These programs will be slashed. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) cynically put forward an argument which acknowledged that there would be a breach of these undertakings, but he then put forward ways in which these undertakings, although breached, could be presentationally massaged so that the conflict between the pre&hyphen;election commitments and post&hyphen;election behaviour was less obvious. Of course, the minister has been sent out to do a grubby little job on behalf of the coalition. It is a dirty little job which I am certain does him no credit and does his government no credit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The obvious absurdity of the position that has been put forward&mdash;that these changes do no more than reflect what the outgoing administration itself would have done&mdash;comes from the fact that the coalition's costing showed that savings of some $60 million are intended to be made by virtue of these changes. So there is deceit and there are lies, and those least able to defend themselves, the most vulnerable in society, are the target of those measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you turn to the two&hyphen;year waiting period for new arrivals in Australia. The two&hyphen;year waiting period was asserted to be an extension of what the previous Labor government had introduced as a waiting period for a number of benefits, principally unemployment benefits for new arrivals. We introduced a six&hyphen;month period. We thought that that was an appropriate balance between the responsibility of the Australian society to provide some form of residual and common welfare system for all permanent residents of this country and also a recognition that new arrivals and those that were sponsoring them had a prime responsibility to at least meet those initial settlement costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition in presenting its policies argued that six months was not long enough and said that a two&hyphen;year waiting period would be more appropriate. But nowhere did it suggest in any way that it intended to widen the nature or range of benefits for which an exclusion period would be provided, nor did it suggest in any way that there would be new categories of citizens who would be subjected to it. In fact, the whole presentation was on the basis that existing rights of Australians would be understood and respected. The now Prime Minister was able to approve Senator Short's press release on 19 February 1996 where he said that the coalition's proposal to extend the six months to two years was simply an extended application of the principle established by Labor in 1993. Of course, we still have the Prime Minister <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1610"> saying the same thing. We still have the Prime Minister in the House saying deceitfully that what his government is doing is no more than an extended application of what Labor introduced in 1993. In blunt terms, that assertion is a lie.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In blunt terms, it is a misleading statement and it conflicts with the standards of integrity which the Prime Minister himself asserted were appropriate for the conduct of the parliamentary process. The measures that will come into force as a result of the government's introduction of new legislation were intended to make savings of some $616 million. That is a substantial saving but it was always implausible. It was implausible when it was first uttered and it remains implausible now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the explanatory memorandum that was circulated with the bill introduced by the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, the minister claimed savings of $29 million in the first year, $132.4 million in the second year and $171.1 million in the third year. That left a shortfall of something like $285 million, notwithstanding that in these measures they had, deceitfully and improperly, added every possible new benefit that one could imagine. It meant that these new measures now apply not only to those people who had entered Australia as migrants as we would traditionally understand it, but also to those who entered as spouses of Australians who are permanent residents in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just look at that last point&mdash;spouses. Australians, for example, might travel overseas and might meet and marry somebody overseas. Perhaps I would take a job, as I once did, as an academic at the University of Papua New Guinea and would marry. Many Australians do spend some time outside this country, and increasingly so, given the fact that we are exporting services and one of the things that we are specialising in is being able to provide professional services in the South&hyphen;East Asian economies. Many Australians will be travelling overseas to provide those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we were there, if we had met and married some person who was not an Australian citizen and we had children and then returned to this country, previously we would have expected to bring that person here as of right. We would have expected that person to be accepted and integrated into the Australian community as of right and to be treated as another Australian permanent resident and citizen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is no longer the case. Your new partner, no matter how longstanding the relationship, is treated as one of these persons who is a migrant relying on a two&hyphen;year waiting period. And as for your kids, they do not get the benefits that everybody else gets as an Australian. If they are born overseas, they get minimum family payment only. They do not get any access to things that were once known as the Family Allowance Supplement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So here I am returning from overseas with my new wife, and because I did not meet and marry somebody who was a resident of a state in Australia, I suddenly have to find myself responsible for all those welfare payments if my new spouse becomes ill. We have to survive as a family even though I am a low income worker without access to the Family Allowance Supplement for my children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these measures were not anticipated by the coalition in the words of comfort they gave to the ethnic and Australian communities, and those permanent residents and citizens of Australia who are entitled to know if this was up anyone's sleeve. And the Prime Minister still sits in the House deceitfully saying that this is just an extension of Labor's principles.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1611">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Deputy Speaker quite properly identified to me earlier, there are proper processes of this place to deal with deceit of that kind, and there are processes to call upon persons who have the responsibility to answer for that deceit. So this is not the forum in which to use the strong language which I did earlier. But, nonetheless, strong language is appropriate because this is not a circumstance which we should allow to pass lightly. The costings will not be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I have seen a document of amended costings circulated again, where additional financial savings are intended to be made. No explanation has been provided for this. We had briefings the other day in relation to these measures from the department, and there was no anticipation of additional costings. This is an embarrassing nightmare for the government. They are millions of dollars shy of the costings that they anticipated when they produced their savings documents, the Costello documents. At the time the opposition said that those costings were manifestly absurd. We claimed that they must fall substantially short of what was being proposed for the opposition at that time. We were right. The proof of the pudding is in the figures that are now being produced by the minister herself in the supplementary documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, firstly, we have got cuts to the humanitarian and refugee program which are intended to make $64 million of savings, notwithstanding an express undertaking before the election that they would not be touched. Secondly, we  have the extension of the six&hyphen;month waiting period to two years. Bringing together a host of benefits into that compass makes it a cruel system which lacks compassion. But it is also a program which was not announced to the community before the election. It was deceitfully concealed. Yet even with all those changes, the costings fall far short. So we have an example of a failure of the government to make good the claim to savings that it had anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we are discussing the supply bill, and supply, of course, goes towards the funding that is necessary to carry on the business of government. One of the key issues at the last election was whether the costings of the coalition's promises and the costings of its savings measures were competent and professional. If you have ever seen any proof that they were incompetent and unprofessional, and built on a block of deceit, then you have had it in these measures. In aggregation, they still do not make the costings that they claimed in the first place. This is a humiliation for the minister. It has forced the minister in the Senate to deceive the parliament and it has forced the Prime Minister to make statements which reflect on his good integrity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final comment in relation to the area for which I now have responsibility as a shadow minister turns on the way in which the department is being administered. There are two issues. The first is the abolition of the Office of Multicultural Affairs. The lack of weight that the Prime Minister gave to this area was apparent in the fact that the position of minister for immigration is not a cabinet position. It is also apparent in the abolition of the Office of Multicultural Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That office was intended to be a coordinating agency to bring together programs so that there was a central government focus to ensure that the concerns of new arrivals to Australia or long&hyphen;term residents from a non&hyphen;English speaking background had a range of services taken into account in the planning of government decisions. That office has now been scrapped from the Prime Minister's department and has been given as a side function to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, which had no particular focus on those issues in the past. Because of that, these had to be taken out of the line agency, which was really only <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1612"> responsible for planning for the process of immigration and the management of the refugee and humanitarian programs. It has not had, in the past, a good record in the area of access and equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That department has now been given these functions, but no money. So we have this miraculous process of imagined loaves and fishes, where a department&mdash;which is already reeling under major cuts to its own funding to do the tasks which it was previously allocated&mdash;is expected to pick up new functions from the Prime Minister's office, perform a coordinating role across the whole of government, but with no resources to do it. No wonder they are bleeding. No wonder leaks emerge from this government, falling off the backs of trucks like leaves in Canberra in autumn. They do not have the same colour, they are not as pretty, but they are almost as numerous these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the documents that came to us was the restructuring document. It sets out the changes that will occur within the department to make good some of the shortfalls that have emerged because of the deliberate decisions of this government not only to cut back the funding of the department, but also to impose the changes emerging from having to absorb the Office of Multicultural Affairs from the Prime Minister's office into the department, but with no funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the consequences, which my good colleague the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) will well illustrate when he speaks on a later occasion, is that it means that regional offices of the department in key areas all around Australia will close. It was asserted, for example, at one stage that some of the difficulties will be ameliorated by enabling some visits to take place on a mobile basis. The department has already got rid of most of the vehicles that were there for that purpose. We have this contractionary hard&hyphen;hearted approach trying to squeeze out every last dollar at the expense of the weak and the vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted that I had the opportunity to speak briefly tonight. As the member for Jagajaga anticipated the larger issues, I focused on those which are peculiar to my portfolio, but each illustrates the steely resolve of this government not to address the key issues that it claimed it would be addressing when in opposition and contesting the last election. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to cover some territory tonight. I want us to go back in history. I remind the chamber that parliamentary behaviour has become a major issue in some people's minds in recent times. I well recall that very vivid phrase, coined by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) last year, that truth is absolute. He said that whatever he did in political life would be based on the fundamental statement that truth was all, truth was absolute. There were no half&hyphen;truths. There were no misrecollections. Truth was all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, of course, was prior to the elections&mdash;and during the elections the major thrust of the now government's campaign was endorsement of the then government's policies. The present government went to great pains to point out that Medicare would be kept intact and bulk billing would be maintained, that all the social justice programs would be sustained, and if there was a budget problem it would extend the deficit. In other words, keeping those promises and those programs was more important than any deficit issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was heard over and over and over, because the questions were asked over and over. They were asked over and over for a couple of reasons, one of which being the exaggerated promises that were being made in terms of new programs. So not only was the now government promising to maintain the previous government's programs&mdash;with a few relatively <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1613"> minor exceptions in the global scheme of things&mdash;but it was also offering a lot of new programs. It is in that area that life gets to be very interesting, particularly in terms of truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the budget savings which are being offered to offset these new programs, I am perhaps much less kind than the previous speaker because I think those figures were, in fact, deliberately wrong. I do not think that was any accident. The three areas that were put forward most prominently for cuts were the unemployed, migrants and public servants. They were the three soft touches&mdash;the three areas that you knew would get a cheer around Australia, the three areas people like to dislike. Post&hyphen;election, there has been a fourth one, which is Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you consider what the campaign was doing, I think the comments made by Noel Pearson during the campaign were very poignant. In hindsight, anybody who did not read them then should read them now, because he was spot&hyphen;on: `All of us' meant `but not them'. And the `not them' were the public servants, the migrants, the unemployed and, as he saw it then, the blacks&mdash;the Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it was suggested that the $600 million or more savings on the extension of the access to social security was exaggerated, there was a great hue and cry: of course they were not&mdash;the promises had been costed absolutely to the very dollar. The fact was that they were exaggerated because people were saying, `I always knew those people coming here as migrants were coming to get on our dole.' By exaggerating the figure, you increase the potency of the divisiveness of the message. And it was not accidental. That was no accident; that was quite conscious and quite deliberate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same way, with the public servants, the 2,500, a natural attrition, was never intended&mdash;never, ever. The public knew that. Many of the public servants actually believed you and thought you were telling the truth because, more than most people, they probably would have read your speeches. They probably would have read the Prime Minister's statement that truth is absolute and thought, `Well, he is supposed to be an honest bloke.' Quite a lot of them were not around in 1977&hyphen;78 when there was the `fistful of dollars', or they had forgotten the 1983 budget projections. They actually believed you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And, of course, the Aboriginals were not consulted at all. They were just off main focus&mdash;in the background somewhere. So you picked three soft touches and gave exaggerated&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition picked three areas that were divisive and unpleasant. It exaggerated the costings to show how serious these issues were and it was saying, in effect, that the then government was derelict in wasting so much money in areas where savings of such a magnitude could be made. That was the cleverness of the deceit, because people want to believe that governments are negligent, particularly in those areas, such as the Public Service and so on. The fact that the Public Service had been reduced by 18 per cent in the previous seven or eight years did not matter. I heard one minister at question time in the Senate the other day actually criticising the previous government for reducing the Public Service from 180,000 to 150,000 in the previous eight years. And that was a criticism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the fact that it had been done and you knew that. Many of you complained in previous times about your lack of services. Because of constraints, and because of the cuts to the Public Service, you knew there was not much fat left in the Public Service. The message was there. But now, post&hyphen;election, we are seeing a really fascinating exercise going on. Day by day, it is interesting to watch the shifting, the ducking, the weaving and the dodging <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1614"> around. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Order in the House</EMPHASIS> captured it beautifully on Sunday night when the point was made that it is no longer broken promises, it is a change of policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the previous speaker, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), referred to the extension of the restriction to access for support. This is not seen as social security support or the safety net support but things such as child care and family allowances. Previously, these things were not restricted at all. They have been brought into that election policy of the two&hyphen;year exclusion. The answers to the questions last week, which were re&hyphen;screened on Sunday night, picked up very well the shifting and the change in policy. The fact is it is deceit; it is a broken promise; it is dishonest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And, of course, in amongst that there is this $8 billion fraud and, basically, it is a fraud. What the government is trying to perpetrate on the Australian people is a massive fraud. If the costings were not so accurate and you did not generate a $4 billion deficiency in your own promises&mdash;in terms of your campaign&mdash;why not release the Department of Finance costings? The previous shadow minister has pointed out that the savings in the area of exclusion from access to benefits for new migrants is short by hundreds of millions of dollars. There is at least a $4 billion gap in the government's commitment and its capacities. This attempt to project an $8 billion deficit is a fraud. It is a figment of the imagination of those who put together those costings before the election, and put forward the proposition that they were fully funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anybody has any doubt about that, look at the legislation. Just go through it and look at what has come forward so far. Tonight we have been debating in the House the housing legislation. What does that do? For a government that is so strong on the rights of states and the idea of shifting responsibility to the states, to limit the funds available under the housing agreement to one year absolutely undermines the states. That is the worst thing you could possibly do. To give a billion dollars to the states on an annual basis only means that they cannot plan beyond a year. Therefore, they have to assume that the funds will be cut in the following year. How deceitful is that? How tricky and how sneaky is that? I think those comments from last year about being weak and sneaky that many of us thought would resonate very well are resonating now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at immigration. People were told that the two&hyphen;year exclusion period was simply an extension of the previous government's six months. No, it is not. It is in fact a whole new issue. The member for Denison pointed out how many young Australians and older Australians will be affected by this. A constituent of mine, who is now an American citizen, has a father who has had a stroke. If he migrates back here, as he will probably have to, who is going to look after him? His father cannot because he is a pensioner. He will not get a carer's pension. How is he going to cope? He was forced to become an American citizen because of his wife and so that he could work in America. If he migrates back, as he is planning to, he has a huge problem. This is a government that really looks after the most vulnerable! The inclusion of the carer's pension in that exclusion period was not promised. It is an absolute deceit. It is sneaky, deceitful, deceptive and slippery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had another wonderful one just last week. Suddenly, after all the years of discussion and debate, out of nowhere there is a new Sydney airport site. Why didn't somebody think of it before? Why didn't it happen 10 years ago? You say, `The fact that there have been all these other meetings before the election, well, that is just coincidence. There were thousands of those going on.' But the thousands of other meetings aren't coming forward as proposals and aren't having an EIS funded.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1615">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provisional tax: great policy, great stunt; lousy legislation, great con. Six per cent for one year only and then back not to 8 per cent but to 10 per cent on a year by year basis. Great con. Go back to small business and self&hyphen;funded retirees and tell them that that is what you really meant, because you never said that. You said that the uplift factor will reduce to 6 per cent, full stop&mdash;not for one year. They assumed you meant it for the life of the parliament. You asked them to vote for you for three years, not for one year. How many of you can go back to your community and tell them that that is what you meant? The fact is that you did not know it yourselves. A very small number knew, and some of you should be really squirming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I took part in a parliamentary inquiry last year with the current Minister of Immigration (Mr Ruddock)&mdash;an inquiry into migrant access and equity. The report was finished prior to the election. We conducted hearings around Australia, in both capital cities and regional Australia. We ended up with a report which was unanimous and which he suggested the title for. It was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A fair go for all</EMPHASIS>. It puts forward a lot of proposals to improve access and equity for people from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is his first action as a minister? To wipe out the access of people from regional Australia to his departmental services. That is a pretty good trick. That is a pretty consistent little trick, that one. He goes to the migrant community and says, `We care for you, we understand.' That report being bipartisan looks terrific, doesn't it? It is a really good backstop to credibility. So all of those members who represent regional Australia now, mainly from the government, need to explain to their constituents how the minister has acted. Go read the report. It is not a bad report. Go read it and just remember when you are reading it that your minister endorsed every single word. We spent days going through it, I can tell you, and he argued over every word of it. So he endorsed every single word and he is now the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His first action is to cut the services at Townsville, Newcastle, Wollongong, Geelong, Chatswood and Sunshine&mdash;all gone. So much for access and equity. During our hearings the current minister was very concerned about OMA and the fact that it was resident in the department's offices. He was really concerned about that because, if it was going to be genuinely independent and have its staff in the same office, which the then government put forward as a cost saving measure, he was quite sceptical of that being genuine. So what does he do? He abolishes it. It is a nice twist. Those <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> make interesting reading on the current minister's line of questioning and his perceptions of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we get to industrial relations: the big bang stuff, the radical agenda. No&hyphen;one will be worse off; no&hyphen;one will be worse off under your legislation. Day by day, hour by hour, we are all getting examples of who will be worse off. And what do you do? Deny them, twist, turn, change the words, make out that that was not said&mdash;all that obfuscating and all that twisting and sneaking and slithering around. You have only been there for three months. After three months, you have got dozens and dozens of issues running, all of which you are trying to deny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one will be worse off, the government said. Just watch as the cases come forward, one by one, case by case. The ones who worry me are the apprentices because what you are really talking about is wiping out apprenticeships. Quite frankly, young people with ability are not going to work for the kind of money and the kind of commitment that you are putting forward because they know what the apprenticeship scheme pays and you are talking about effectively cutting their current wages by one-fifth. That is what you are talking about doing. And whilst <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1616"> that is dishonest and deceitful and slippery and slimy and all of those things that fit you now so well, the fact is it will discourage young people who would be good tradesmen from becoming tradesmen because they will so distrust the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite a lot of them voted for you because they also thought truth was absolute and that you kept your promises and that `Honest John' could be trusted. Unfortunately, they are finding out otherwise and they are the ones I feel concern for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is going to be an interesting parliament as time unravels and as we see more and more of the detail of your agenda. I think most of the government members will be as interested as we are as to who the real authors are and what the real agenda is because most of the members of the government actually believed what was being put forward by the coalition during the campaign and they are probably finding out about the changes at the same time as we are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am absolutely convinced that the local members in the Hunter did not know about the closure of the immigration offices prior to it coming out publicly. I doubt if they know today that the DAS office has been authorised to be closed as of 30 June. I am sure they do not know about it. I am quite sure that the government members are as surprised as we are about all that is going on. They defended those costings as being accurate and reliable because their shadow Treasurer said they were. Their leader said they were and he was to be trusted because for him truth was absolute.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is this unfolding panorama. Who wrote it, who owns it and what is behind it? We know what is behind it, that has become very clear. The first thing behind it is a transfer of things from the Commonwealth to the states&mdash;housing, health, aged services and home and community care. Go and tell all those people out there that from now on the state government is going to run their service. Why did you not tell them that before the election? Why did you not tell the aged community that you were going to move nursing homes and hostels to the states? Why did you not tell them that before the election? Was it because there are no cost savings available in that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot justify that with your $8 billion fraud. Why did you not tell the families of Australia about child care being transferred to the states? Why did you not tell them these things in advance because this just did not happen last week? These were all part of the plan&mdash;exaggerate the costings, create the deficit and then the need for drastic surgery. But the surgery is not saving money. Eventually it will cost more money rather than less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in the 1970s the fistful of dollars description typecast the then Treasurer very well and very accurately. He promised before the election and then took away afterwards. The 1983 budget reinforced that, the then $9 billion, the 4.9 per cent GDP blow&hyphen;out reinforced it. People were persuaded this year that he was reborn. Well, the fact is he is not reborn, he is just reworked. He is weak and sneaky and slithering all over the place.
