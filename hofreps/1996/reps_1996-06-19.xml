<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity today to outline my concerns about the workplace relations legislation, particularly the effect it is likely to have on women. Together with a growing number of women's organisations which have made their views known to government, academics who have studied the legislation, the ACTU and ACOSS, I have numerous reservations about the bill in its present form. Since the bill can be amended in the Senate, I think it is crucial that the government be made aware of the negative effects their proposals are likely to have, particularly on women, so they can remedy the identified deficiencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent discussion of the new legislation, Barbara Pocock from the Centre for Labour Studies at the University of Adelaide outlined a series of questions about this legislation that are pertinent to women. She asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How should women think about these proposals&mdash;with optimism and positive expectations, or with suspicion and concern?</PARA>
<PARA>She then went on to answer her own question. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Australian and International experience and the overwhelming weight of Government research count for anything, there are few arguments for optimism, and many reasons for concern.</PARA>
<PARA>That is her summary position. Having examined the legislation and the research that she talked about, that is precisely my conclusion, too. Whichever way you look at the government's proposals, they are certain to be very bad news indeed for women, although the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) continues to insist that women will be among the major beneficiaries, a view which has been explicitly rejected by a group of researchers at the Labour and Industry Research Unit at the University of Queensland. In a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 18 June, they reject Reith's claim as both illogical and unsupported by any evidence. That is a pretty strong rebuttal of the minister's position.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the coalition would have us believe that they are governing for all of us, this legislation is conspicuously not for women and, therefore, not for the families which depend on them&mdash;and that is a great many. The amendments contained in the legislation undermine the likelihood of genuine equality in the workplace. That should be a grave concern to all women in Australia. Far from making women's tasks of juggling work and family responsibilities easier, they are likely to make it even more difficult than it already is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally speaking, commentators around the world on the effects of enterprise level bargaining&mdash;particularly individual contracts&mdash;as opposed to centralised bargaining have identified several characteristics of women's employment which already place women at a considerable disadvantage. Firstly, women are concentrated in lower paid and low skilled jobs, particularly if they are recent migrants from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds. Higher levels of part&hyphen;time and casual work also characterise women's employment. You have, too, the influence of interrupted work and family responsibilities, which means that women are less likely to be senior in their organisations. Historically, we all know that women's work has been undervalued. That is something that is only now being remedied through investigations by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, it is worth noting that women already typically work in sectors which are underrepresented by unions. They are also less likely to be union members or to hold senior positions in union organisations. That matters. As the researchers from Queensland University I quoted earlier point out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is precisely this lack of industrial power which makes it imperative that women are able to work within the union movement to pursue greater equity.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, they go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . one would be hard pressed to identify a single significant gain for women in the industrial sphere which has not been won by women working within the union movement.</PARA>
<PARA>They are unlikely to achieve improvements by themselves. That needs to be done collective <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2188"> ly. These features of women's positions in the workplace, together with the provisions of the bill which are generally detrimental to low wage and low skilled workers, are a lethal combination for women workers. The outcome is doubly insulting when one considers that many of the proposals in the bill were either not signalled before the federal election or are in direct contravention to the promises given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard&mdash;and we have heard this many times in this place&mdash;made a lot of his promise that no worker would be worse off. His rock solid guarantee for women now looks more like a pile of sand likely to be blown away by the first winds of the so&hyphen;called Howard reforms. In this case, as in similar legislation in Western Australia, Victoria and Tasmania, in my view the word `reform' is seriously misplaced. Reform, to me at least, suggests improvement or change leading to improvement. I am very bemused when the word `reform' is used to characterise changes which represent a diminution of conditions or entitlements, as in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, buzz words like flexibility sound attractive and appealing, since none of us likes to be rigid, but that word is also often used misleadingly to cover reductions in standards of protection available to workers. That is not a flexibility that I care to endorse. Think about flexibility for a moment; it is said to be one of the benefits of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of additional flexibility can operate in a workplace? One is the flexibility, for example, to change wages. This legislation means that will usually be downward. Another is the flexibility to change the number of workers. Again, as we are seeing right now, that is usually downward, despite some recent warnings from the architect of downsizing orthodoxy, Stephen Loach. The sort of flexibility that, sadly, is often lacking in the thinking of the government and in workplaces generally in Australia is flexibility in the way workers perform&mdash;better management, better training, more efficiency on the job with better equipment and cooperative relations with workers. That is the sort of flexibility that I endorse.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After more than a decade of ascendancy by the supply side economic rationalists, I am pleased to say that we are beginning to see the emergence of some doubters, some economists and policy makers who are beginning to argue that the deregulated, low wage route may not be the panacea to improve competitiveness that it is claimed to be. I welcome the voices of those doubters, and it is very sad that the government is embracing an orthodoxy that a lot of countries are now looking at with some scepticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposals in the legislation make wages and conditions&mdash;and I think this is critical&mdash;the subject of private negotiations between the individual worker and his or her employer. Think about that for a moment. How good would any of us be at negotiating by ourselves and for ourselves the wages and conditions of our employment? I think if we are honest we would say that it would be difficult, particularly when we do not know what others are earning because these contracts are going to be secret.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation quite deliberately gives precedence to individual over collective bargaining, and explicitly and deliberately tries to weaken unions and remove the collective from the enterprise. As Margaret Thatcher found in Britain, that is very short&hyphen;sighted. She destroyed the unions&mdash;or certainly weakened their power&mdash;but workers' conditions did not improve and neither did productivity. Indeed, investment in manufacturing in the UK went down and their position in the international stakes significantly deteriorated. So this legislation quite deliberately tries to destroy the collective. The idea that workers could get together and try to pressure an employer or an employer group to improve wages and conditions is rejected in these very derivative proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Systems such as those embodied in this legislation I think are based on a very ludicrous premise, and that is that there is no inequality of bargaining power between employers and employees. I think that is a staggering proposition. As characterised by Bennett, this sort of legislation treats individual employers and individual employees as fundamentally equivalent and, in fact, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2189"> legislation privileges the goals of efficiency and productivity and social justice&mdash;something that seriously concerns me. Where unions are still powerful under this legislation, we will not see immediate reductions in pay levels, but in weakly organised sectors of the work force the insistence on individual contracts will, I believe, herald greatest risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A look at the wording of the bill, including its objectives, gives us an idea of what it is really designed to achieve. It places undue emphasis on economic as opposed to balanced economic and social objectives, something that has been the cornerstone of our IR system and particularly beneficial to those whose labour can relatively easily be replaced. That is particularly so at a time of high unemployment. As a nation we have consistently promoted the idea of a `living wage', underlining the fact that it is not simply the economic benefits conferred on the society that we are talking about but the circumstances in which people live their lives, their work satisfaction and so on. As Solow put it in his 1989 Berkeley lectures, `Human beings are not tradeable commodities.' The phrase `labour market' in fact is a misnomer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation clearly views the contract between the employer and the employee as just like any other contract. If you are an employer, it is just like going out to buy other materials for your business. To the employee, of course, it is the most critical, the most important, contract of all&mdash;the one that will dictate his or her standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government seems to believe, as I suggested earlier, that employers and employees are really equal partners. That is either incredibly naive or incredibly stupid when you look at the position, particularly of women, in the workplace. I must say that I have never really heard anyone seriously suggest in the past that an employer and an employee are equal partners, yet that is the view embodied in this legislation. It is not putting workers down to say that; it is a simple acknowledgment that, if you are an applicant for a job, for example, and you are one of several hundred, you are hardly in the same bargaining position as the employer who has the one job you want. When there is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> systematic discrimination, as has been shown to be the case against women, you are in an even weaker position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some familiarity with this because in Western Australia, my own state, people were given very strong assurances before the introduction of legislation that they would not be forced into signing these contracts which now apply in Western Australia. A court found recently that employers were indeed forcing young people, in this case, into signing contracts, saying, `Unless you sign the contract, you will not get the job.' We were told when we raised that prospect before the legislation passed that it was alarmist, scare tactics and the like, but the court found that it had happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It took a young man&mdash;as it turns out, the son of a union official&mdash;to demonstrate that, because these were private negotiations, there was no representative there, no union to back him up. He simply walked in and the employer said, `Well, here's the job. Sign the contract. If you don't want the job, then don't sign the contract.' He tape&hyphen;recorded the interview and was able to prove to the court that this had happened. I am sure that he was not alone. This of course is the only way you can get the information under this legislation too, since you are not allowed to have someone help bargain on your behalf; you have to do it directly. For young people and for women, particularly those who for various reasons feel powerless, that will be very difficult indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to have a look at some of the features of this legislation which are particularly worrying to women, on the basis of the data that is already available from countries which have experimented with these individual contracts and, indeed, you might say, evidence that is already available as we have shifted away from centralised bargaining to enterprise level bargaining. We have already seen some of the moves that should be of concern to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While data on the equity implications of enterprise bargaining is scarce in Australia, the Commonwealth DIR study on developments under the federal act up to 1994 already give some cause for concern. In their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2190"> survey, they found that employees reported deterioration rather than improvement in their working conditions. In addition to low levels of satisfaction with management, workers reported weakening levels of job security, increases in job stress and growing dissatisfaction with their ability to balance work and family responsibilities. And that is in the current system, even where you have unions backing them up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the little data available tended to show was that women were more likely to be covered by enterprise agreements which actually traded off the number of hours and work provisions generally, with changed shift provisions having a much more negative effect on women than men. Men were able to get their wage increases, typically, without trading off hours and conditions. A New South Wales study in 1993 of agreements under the Liberal act there found that women workers were more likely to have made substantial trade&hyphen;offs to secure wage increases&mdash;longer hours, less predictable hours. Furthermore, pay data from the states that have already introduced workplace agreements show that you get a greater gender pay gap and it has begun to widen in Victoria at more than double the national rate when you consider average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia&mdash;where male average weekly earnings are $748.20 compared with the national average of $705.80&mdash;we have always been ahead of the national average. Western Australia's female average weekly earnings are actually below the national average at $570.60 compared with $586 nationally&mdash;and the gap is growing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the New Zealand experience is instructive, particularly since financial commentators often present it as an exemplar for Australian policy makers. They say that we should follow the New Zealand experience. Hammond in 1994 examined both countrywide data that was available&mdash;and with these secret contracts it is difficult to get hold of&mdash;and individual industry sectors to try to assess the impact on women of the so-called free market deregulation approach that is embodied in New Zealand's individual employment contracts. A lot of their features are very similar to this legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explicit goals of the New Zealand legislation were, firstly, to decentralise wage setting&mdash;that is familiar; to limit the role of external regulation&mdash;that is familiar; to establish individual contracts, as in this legislation; to abolish the award system, which is the effective outcome of this legislation; to remove state support for unionism&mdash;again, a feature of this legislation&mdash;to support collective bargaining and to provide for a set of minimum conditions, minimal employment rights. These, as I say, are all characteristic of the proposed Australian legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of these objectives have been achieved in New Zealand, with a substantial drop in union membership&mdash;particularly, I might say, in industries where women are in the majority. Union access to the workplace, as was proposed in the legislation, is at the discretion of the employer. Again, that has a certain familiar ring to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effects of these reductions are cited in Andrews' research which finds that, where employees were in well organised and effective unions, collective contracts were more likely to be secured&mdash;they did manage to stick with some level of collective bargaining&mdash;and workers sacrificed less in comparison with employees who were employed on individual contracts. Guess who most of those employees were, the ones on individual contracts who secured worse conditions? Women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wage movements in New Zealand are already leading to a relatively poorer outcome for women. At last assessment just in one year alone, there had been a further one per cent drop in their wages. All sectors of the work force, except public administration, registered small wage increases for women overall but less than for men. In the retail sector, where the men's increase was 4.6 per cent, there was a decline for women of 0.6 per cent. So even when women are in a majority they are doing less well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Data from the 1,101 employment contracts that they were able to examine showed poorer wage results for women: where agreements were reached in mainly women's sectors, they were less likely to attract overtime or penalty rates; women were more likely to work for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2191"> ordinary rates of pay on any day of the week and were less likely to attract productivity payments. That is the evidence. That is what is happening under a system where you have individual contracts which are not subject to public scrutiny, where the role of the union is diminished and where the industrial relations system is dismantled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comparing retail sales workers with mechanics&mdash;largely female workers with male workers&mdash;Hammond concluded that decentralised bargaining clearly disadvantaged women workers not only in base pay but also in overtime and productivity payments. Bargaining actually rarely occurred in the retail sector and in most cases pre-determined contracts were simply presented to workers. I am sure we will see that happen again. It is happening in Victoria and it is happening in Western Australia&mdash;half&hyphen;page contracts that people are being asked to sign often put out by the local Chamber of Commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This same research found that most firms removed overtime and penalty rates, and women often had to work unpredictable and longer hours. The same is likely under this legislation. Furthermore, as Andrews has pointed out, those on individual contracts are faring worse and have given greater concessions to employers than those on collective contracts. This is, in part, a result of the fact that the most poorly paid and disadvantaged women have effectively been deprived of any representation at all. Again, that is a likely outcome of the legislation that is before this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am pointing out is that there is already considerable evidence that an overly deregulated labour market is not good news for women; it is simply not desirable for them. Indeed, the reverse is true. Studies by Whitehouse of labour market inequality in OECD countries led her to conclude&mdash;and she is not alone in this&mdash;that centralised wage fixing arrangements are shown to be strongly associated with high relative earnings for women. And the reverse is true: decentralised with lower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having examined a range of regimes where you have both industrial and anti-discrimination provisions to enhance pay equity, she <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> found that prospects of pay equity depend more on centralised wage fixing, with the difference between the most and the least being 16.8 per cent, than on the enactment of equal opportunity legislation. Yet we have the minister telling us that women will be protected by the equal opportunity legislation, since he is choosing to remove the capacity of the Industrial Relations Commission to examine particularly discrimination in overaward payments. The international experience shows that that simply does not work, and Australia's position as second in pay equity is likely to be significantly undermined by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important that, when we go through the detail of the provisions of this bill&mdash;and I certainly mean to speak further on individual elements of it&mdash;we recognise that those people in the community who are already less well rewarded for their work, who are often in part-time and casual work, who are not senior in their organisations and who are not well represented in unions are the ones who are most likely to suffer from this legislation. Individual contracts and deregulation in and of themselves have already been shown to be inimical to the interests of women. Women are already amongst the poorest in this community and this will exacerbate it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposed workplace relations legislation is a vast document. One cannot discuss the whole document in one parliamentary sitting let alone do the same in one parliamentary speech. Whatever are the perceived benefits or distractions of the legislation, I believe that there are members on both sides of House who would readily agree on specific proposed changes. That would remove the existing disputations that now occur because of the current act. In fact, I know that there is bipartisan support for a large part of this policy within the Labor Party. The former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, conceded in his speech to the Institute of Directors that Australia needed a model of industrial relations which would place primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbi <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2192"> tral tribunals, and for those awards and wage increases to be a safety net only.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Keating even agreed that over time there would be fewer awards and fewer clauses. But, unfortunately, Mr Keating did not have the intestinal fortitude to put these ideas into practice because of big union pressure. Recently, a former Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, agreed that the coalition government has a mandate for changing the industrial relations system. He was quoted as saying that the trade union movement must recognise the right of an employer and an employee to freely enter into individual contracts underpinned by an independently determined safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the enigmatic Bill Kelty reiterated the union movement's support for enterprise bargaining and six years ago, in 1990, criticised employers for dragging the chain on moving towards a more flexible industrial relations system. In addition to that profound statement, Mr Kelty said that under a regime of enterprise bargaining the Industrial Relations Commission would play a limited role, returning to its traditional function of establishing minimum rates of pay. The coalition government agrees with Mr Kelty and has acted promptly to enact this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the ACTU has been fairly successful in achieving many union amalgamations, they have not produced the effects they were designed to achieve. The amalgamation strategy was intended to enhance the quality of services to its members and to increase the ability of unions to recruit new members. However, union rationalisation has not improved the quality of services. Because of this lack of service to individual members, the membership of unions has drastically declined. Key union officials have not been released to take on new functions to provide services for their members. You do not have to go past the AMH dispute at the meatworks in Rockhampton to see this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unions have laid off bright, young, up&hyphen;and&hyphen;coming union scholars and to their detriment they have kept the same entrenched hierarchy in executive positions. On top of that, unions have been turning on each other and poaching members from smaller unions. In this area <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> alone the union movement has wasted millions of dollars in demarcation and poaching disputes. How ridiculous can you get? If they were in business they would be bankrupt. This farce begs the question: how much influence does the rank and file member have in the election of the ACTU executive? I will tell you. They have none, zilch, zero!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One area where I believe there is room for improvement in the current situation is in relation to the freedom of association section of the proposed act. Freedom of association is one of the fundamental principles of the coalition government's industrial relations policy. It gives all workers in this country the right to decide to join a union of their choice whose eligibility rules cover them, to not join a union or to even start a union of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue that the `conveniently belong' provisions of the existing legislation can only be described as utterly ridiculous. This antiquated dinosaur has caused more problems in the union movement than the collective efforts of Menzies, Gorton, Fraser and Howard in the past 40 years. Without any direct say in the matter, ordinary workers have been deprived of what I believe is a right&mdash;that is, to collectively choose to be members of a registered industrial organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A decision by the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrarily hand over members of one union to a second union upon application by the second union at Mount Isa Mines is a glaring example of how ordinary workers have no real say in what organisation they choose to have represent them. In short, this meant that workers were forced to pay dual membership which would have meant members paying between $30 and $40 a week to the AWU and the CFMEU. This is absolutely crazy and shows up an industrial relations commission&mdash;and I will talk about that later&mdash;that has moved with no direction or compassion, especially in regard to workers at Mount Isa Mines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not hard to imagine the anger and frustration that has developed within the union movement because existing representation by a registered industrial organisation was considered to be unlawful. Now we have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2193"> a similar situation at the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal in Mackay. The CFMEU members have been disenfranchised against their will. Despite the CFMEU being the major union in Australia's coal ports and despite an ACTU ballot in 1995 where the overwhelming majority of all production workers supported a decision to stay with the CFMEU, the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission has awarded exclusive coverage at the site to the AWU.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LK6">Mr MAREK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are working on that. As a result, it would be hard to argue that the interests of the rank and file workers are seriously considered by these unions that say they are representative of their members' views. In fact, it is the opposite. The stronger unions have monopolised the scene for their own power&hyphen;playing political purposes, much to the detriment of the smaller unions that have been booted out of the way. That will not be allowed to happen in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government will repeal the `conveniently belong' restrictions on registration and changes to the eligibility rules. We will encourage new unions to form if the members are not getting a fair deal from their elected representatives. To this end, workers will be allowed to establish their own unions with special skills and services to suit themselves. They will also be allowed to amalgamate with a bigger union or disamalgamate from one. This is called freedom of choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Freedom of choice is what democracy is all about. It is the foundation of this country's constitution. It is no different from a situation where shoppers choose where to buy their groceries every week or where diners choose where to eat at lunch time. Consumers have the right to pick and choose where they buy their products and services. If they do not like the product or service or think the price is too high, they can go to a competitor elsewhere to receive what is called consumer satisfaction. But right now union members cannot do that. This term has no such meaning in the present legislation. Consumer satisfaction is not in the union vocabulary.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members are forced to toe the line even if the union representative is an overpaid, uneducated political nincompoop. If all unions had to apply genuine principles of competition to attract and retain membership, then they would be truly representative of their members. The present climate is, `We are bigger than you, therefore we must be better. We shout louder than you, so we must be stronger than you. We have mates in high places, so we'll get our own way.' This is a complete fallacy, yet this is what the union movement in this country has been doing for decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But under this government's legislation the union which continues to take that attitude will be out of business as quick as you can say `Christopher Skase'. However, on the other hand, the union which looks at innovative approaches to providing quality services for its members, the union which listens to its rank and file members and acts positively on behalf of the majority, and the union which provides a comprehensive no&hyphen;frills, no&hyphen;thrills cost&hyphen;effective service will flourish under this new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industrial Relations Commission has been operating like a car without lights driving in the dark. The commissioner has not been able to see where he is going, let alone know why he is going there. Of course, the ACTU originally tried to help the commissioner find his way and then decided to obstruct him by introducing its own agenda. According to the ACTU, the commission has been perceived as being part of the problem rather than a solution to the problem of bringing about economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACTU has been responsible for a series of attacks on the commission over the years in an attempt to erode its standing in the community. The ACTU has encouraged affiliates to bypass the commission and mount strike campaigns in key sectors or industries to win increases for employees through direct negotiations, presenting the commission with a fait accompli when it did not like one of the commission's decisions. So much for the independence of the commission&mdash;which, I might add, operated under the auspices of the Labor government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2194">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, Mr Kelty has called the commission `incredibly stupid' and said that the bench behaved like `a bunch of clowns'. One of Mr Kelty's famous quotes summed up the attitude of the ACTU when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One would have to be a very brave person to suggest the commission will be given any significant role in the next wage&hyphen;fixing system.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the commission's role will still be important, though different. The commission will set and adjust the safety net. The commission will continue to have powers to facilitate bargaining for certified agreements and to suspend or terminate the bargaining period. The commission will have new powers to give directions to stop or prevent unprotected industrial disputes which are backed up by the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will also continue to exercise its existing powers in relation to unprotected industrial action, that is: stand&hyphen;down provisions; refraining from hearing matters where a party is not complying with an award, order, direction or recommendation; suspension or cancellation of awards; and orders in relation to industrial action in the Commonwealth and territory public sectors. The commission will play an important role in the new unfair dismissal laws by mediating and conciliating on outcomes, dealing with disputes and ensuring compliance with awards and agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe enterprise bargaining in its pure form is intended to concern only the employee and employers. In its pure form, the parties cannot be forced and are under no obligation to talk and consult with one another. However, the reality is that there is a rigid bureaucratic system that must be followed to formalise any agreement. Adherence to this form of system is deficient in that it may lead to agreements that are not in the best interests of the employer or employees as the rekindled agreement by the Industrial Relations Commission may not be what was originally sought by the relevant parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I must raise an issue that I believe can be very helpful in promoting a less combative atmosphere in relation to enterprise bargain ing. In relation to collective bargaining, John Niland, author of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Collective bargaining and compulsory arbitration in Australia</EMPHASIS>, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parties must have a philosophical commitment to direct negotiation as a means of dispute settlement and as a result approach the negotiations in good faith.</PARA>
<PARA>I had hoped the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) would be here to listen to the next statement I am going to make, for the following is an area that the rank and file at local branch level have been trying to get through to the ACTU and, in fact, the Labor government for years. And, yes, this is one of the areas that brought your government down. I am confident that, while this coalition government applies this philosophy to its day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day workings, we can possibly maintain government for a lot longer into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that in mind, it is not unreasonable to ask why the proposed changes by the government in its industrial relations policy remove the obligation to bargain in good faith. It has introduced a philosophy that Australians consistently ask for and, in many cases, fight tooth and nail to try to achieve. The initiative is called `consultation'. This initiative&mdash;although many know the word so well&mdash;is a process that will out&hyphen;step the current system of concession bargaining or, as our Labor friends over here call it, enterprise bargaining. We all know that some companies in the past have not hesitated to exploit their work force. Employers must recognise that the wages workers receive are not viewed as a cost but as an income to support their family and maintain a decent standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to acknowledge that some employees do not always act in the best interests of their employers. For them it seems illogical to reason that an action based on getting even with the boss or bringing the boss down can contribute to increased wages and job security. This can no longer be allowed to happen in the future under this legislation. Therefore, we must ensure that employees do the right thing by the work force and that employers do the right thing by their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this nation to become internationally competitive there must be a fundamental <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2195"> change to the relationship between employer and employee. That involves changing the culture of the workplace from one of an adversarial nature to one based on an atmosphere of trust and cooperation. If an attempt is not made to reach a fair deal for all through consultation, then we will be forever changing the format of industrial relations or be forced to deal with contentious issues from both sides of the work force, severely stopping us from advancing into the new millennium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to the unfair dismissal provisions will result in keeping an election promise of a fair go for all. It is untenable to argue that the current unfair dismissal provisions provide an atmosphere conducive to small business expanding its work force by hiring more part&hyphen;time and permanent staff. There is undeniable proof that it does not provide a fair go for all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new legislation will still protect workers under the awards from unfair dismissal through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The commission will continue to have the power to deal with the dismissal of employees covered by federal awards and agreements. But, at the same time, frivolous and malicious claims will be discouraged. This provision will allow the majority of small businesses in this country to start employing staff again with the knowledge that, if these new employees cannot do the job, they should not keep the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, one can only support the initiative that this coalition government has shown in relation to discrimination based on sex. I question whether the last speaker, the Hon. Dr Carmen Lawrence, has read the policy document regarding women in the workplace. This government has shown the intestinal fortitude required to eliminate discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction, or social origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this in mind, I have had first&hyphen;hand experience in the coal mining industry where women play a crucial role in their job as shiftman miner. This means that women have the ability, regardless of gender, to compete <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the marketplace for a job that they consider is to their ability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For too long, small business has been held to ransom by an industrial relations system that not only scoffs at small business but also throws mud in the face of the very people who are prepared to put their life savings on the line. At the end of the day, businesses must have the right to manage their own businesses so that the outcome sought is the outcome achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appointment of an Employment Advocate, a statutory officer, whose powers and functions will be laid down in legislation, is a step in the right direction. It will take the burden off the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The Employment Advocate will have the ability to resolve problems as they come to hand, rather than a need to have long&hyphen;sitting industrial disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country needs an industrial relations package that will get it back on the rails. I have faith in much of what is being proposed in the industrial reform package, but I cannot stress enough that consultation from all sectors of the community is imperative for us to achieve that aim.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about unions&mdash;as discussed by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, and who is leaving the chamber&mdash;let us also say something about employer organisations. The clear evidence is that a number of the major employer organisations are not employer organisations presenting industrial problems and looking for industrial solutions. They are political organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is a political organisation. If one watches its responses to industrial relations issues, one finds those responses are invariably, firstly, political responses. There may be some industrial influence further down the line as one goes through the responses and the comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Business Council of Australia is an organisation comprising the top 80 corporations in this country. What they have to say about industrial relations and about training and all the matters relating to improving productivity, competitiveness and efficiency bears little relationship to the problems of the other 798,000&hyphen;odd firms and employers in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country. The BCA speaks for the top 80 corporations, corporations quite able to look after their own industrial relations. They have a panoply of resources available to them to deal with their industrial relations problems. The fiction that is promoted by the other side of politics about what happens in the workplace is best evidenced when one turns to the Australian workplace industrial relations survey of 1991, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industrial Relations at Work</EMPHASIS>, the only survey of its nature carried out in recent decades. On page 211 of the report, when referring to industrial disputation, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While industrial disputation is more common at some workplaces, the survey shows that Australian industrial relations is not primarily about industrial disputation. The majority of workplaces in the survey were characterised by industrial peace. Managers and, where present, delegates experienced a general level of satisfaction with management&hyphen;employee relations at workplaces, which implied that in the majority of Australian workplaces grievances and complaints were dealt with as they arose.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that report in a moment. If we look at the large employer organisations, we see that what they have to say and their view of the world are pitched at their needs. Progress has been made there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look back to 1983 and compare that with the situation when the former Labor government came to office, we see that there was double digit unemployment of around 11 or 12 per cent, double digit inflation of almost 12 per cent, a prime interest rate of 22&half; per cent and the highest level of unemployment in 60 years. That was the legacy left by the Fraser&hyphen;Howard government of that time. Since that period there has been a 60 per cent reduction in the level of industrial disputation under the Labor government and under the accord.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the accord brought about was a major redistribution in the share of gross domestic product going to profits. Let us look back over the years and ask what was produced. There was an improvement in productivity, an improvement in international competitiveness, a massive reduction in industrial disputes, an increase in the profit share going to proprietors&mdash;and then there was the accord package <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2197"> itself, which embraced not just a real wage increase but also a range of social issues. For example, there was the social wage, which picked up the provision of health care and child care; support for the unemployed and low income families; and training and education. It was a package designed to help employees and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what is behind this approach of the government. When they attack trade unions and members of trade unions, they attack Australian families. That is really what this legislation is about. This legislation and this government's policies are about turning the clock back to the 1950s and further back to the Industrial Revolution. The suggestion has been made that in some way an employee sitting down with an employer ought best be able to discuss the employee's needs, entitlements and conditions. Why should some third party, it is proposed, intrude into this amiable discussion? I have news for those opposite who come from small business: ask most people working in small business how they get on in those kinds of discussions. Ask any member of the Hunter region, which I come from, if they have not received complaints from employees about denial of pay and conditions or abuse at work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that employees do not have an equal part in negotiations. It is a negotiation of unequals. I suggest that this legislation is a plausible yarn, a bit of fiction. You will get away with it for a while, but the test will come a little later as people begin to understand that you are about reducing their pay and conditions. We have heard about the platitude of flexibility&mdash;flexibility in employment conditions where employees sit down with an employer and work out a just deal. That is utter fiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> There is no obstacle or barrier to paying people more than they are entitled to under their award conditions. There is no prohibition on or barrier to paying people more or improving their conditions, but there is a barrier to paying people less than their award provisions. When this government talks about flexibility, it means the flexibility&mdash;the ability&mdash;to reduce workers' pay and conditions. When you do that, you are attacking Austral ian families, their livelihood and their family income. That is down the track, but that is what this legislation is about. It is almost a mirror of the New Zealand legislation. It has the same platitudes, the same plausible story about flexibility, private negotiations and individual workplace agreements, but it is about reducing family incomes. You will pay the price for that later down the track. Enjoy the pleasure you are having at the moment because further down the track you will pay the price for this attack on Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's overall policy is about worsening people's pay and conditions and having the flexibility to reduce them. It is about contracting the economy to add to the unemployed. It is about reducing the number of people available in the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to help people who are unemployed. It is about reducing the funds available for employment projects, for training and for community organisations that help place and train people. For example, our skillshare scheme has been a national success in helping people get back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of that boils down to strengthening the position of some employers to reduce pay and conditions. That is what this legislation is about. That is what the policy of this government is about. You can clothe it in all the platitudes that you want, but you cannot move away from the unalterable fact that it is about reducing pay and conditions, and worsening entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what the largest private sector employer has to say about this legislation. The Managing Director of BHP, John Prescott, was interviewed on 28 May on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program. It was put to him that unions were clearly unhappy with the bill. When asked whether he thought the advantages of deregulation could be outweighed by industrial disruption, John Prescott said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope not. I think it's up to the employers to have sensible discussions with the unions where the unions are a force in a particular industry. For our part&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I emphasise this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we intend to conduct our industrial relations on the same basis as we have, that is by getting closer to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2198"> our employees and understanding them better, and seeking their commitment, and where the unions have been involved in that process we have found them to be increasingly supportive and co&hyphen;operative.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Those words are not the platitudes of those opposite; they are not the words of politicians opposite and their speech writers. They are the words of the largest private sector employer in this country, a man who comes from an industrial relations background himself&mdash;he was in the industrial relations division of BHP before he moved on to his position of Managing Director of BHP. There is the hard evidence of those who employ people and have to make massive decisions across this country that lead to improving international competitiveness and international trade and the employment of people and their entitlements. That is the experience of big practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to the award system. What is the award system there for? The award system grew out of a situation where, in the last century, individuals tried to get fair treatment from employers. Eventually, employees formed themselves into groups, back in the 1890s, at a time when going on strike could mean long gaol terms. That happened in the Hunter region, the area I come from. It happened in other parts of Australia. Unionists went to gaol for long periods for going on strike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of that grew the formation of unions, but concomitant with that grew the formation of employer organisations. They had come to the realisation that you have to have an orderly set of arrangements. Then, in the early part of the century, came the development&mdash;through the formation of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and Justice Higgins&mdash;of the basic wage award and those original early decisions to set in place a proper set of arrangements that provided for working conditions and minimum rates of pay, award rates of pay, which had developed over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The award is there to provide for minimums, not maximums. That is the point that is deliberately overlooked by those opposite in all the words they utter on this issue. Really, what they are talking about is turning <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the clock back. They talk about this blind, unsubstantiated faith that if you turn the clock back and let employees talk to employers it will be a much happier world and everybody will do better. That is not going to happen, and the New Zealand experience shows that very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to move on to the unfair dismissals section of the bill. The issue of unfair dismissals is improperly titled. The issue involved here is employee protection from unfair dismissal by employers. There would not be a member, state or federal, in the Hunter region who has not received complaints about abuse, underpayment of wages or ill treatment by employers. There would not be a case where that has not happened amongst federal and state members in our region. You will rarely get a problem from an employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation that we brought in, when last in government, was based upon the legislation of the Greiner government of 1991. That legislation did not provide for compensation. Our legislation did. There were some teething problems with it but they were dealt with in the amendments back in the early part of this year. I know of no instance where it has been brought out that there have been problems arising from that. There has to be a balance between employer and employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The kinds of cases that we have dealt with in our area involve major employers underpaying young women, and a major employer requiring the wage book to be signed for hours less than the actual hours being worked. The parents come to see me about what should be done about it and then two days later ring me and say, `Please don't do anything about it. Don't go any further because we really need the little bit of money we're getting at the moment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other cases, particularly involving young women&mdash;and this bears upon young women more than any other group&mdash;of mistreatment at work, of harassment, of the hours of work generally and of age dismissal: they turn 18 and they are out the door, nothing whatsoever to do with their performance, their quality as employees or their contribution. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2199">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The whole dismissal issue has really been about trying to ensure that people are treated fairly, and it is about employee protection. If this legislation gets through, I am going to be very vigilant to ensure that my constituents are protected against the kinds of abuses that come forward that those opposite want to protect and want to cover up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I have referred to the award system and the attitude towards unions. The people in the community, particularly younger people, expect there to be a set of wage rates and conditions that are automatically there. They do not know how they have come to be there. They are there because of the development of the trade union movement, because of the industrial relations system and because of the work done over the years by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the tasks that it performs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community might not be sure how the system came to be in place, but if this legislation gets through in the form that it is in&mdash;I hope it does not&mdash;and it starts to bear down upon employees and they suddenly find they are required to accept what is forced upon them by their employers, a reduction in conditions, pay and entitlements, then they are going to get a dramatic awakening. They are suddenly going to realise what the system was and how they came to have award rates, protections and entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal that is coming from those opposite is draconian. The role of trade unions has been to ensure that there is a system in which everybody has a fair go and that there is a system where there is an umpire in the nature of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, young people will very much be the target of this legislation and the target of what the government is about. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) referred in his second reading speech to `an intolerable rate of unemployment at 8.9 per cent'. That comes from those opposite whose Prime Minister, when Treasurer, left a legacy of almost 12 per cent unemployed. That was his legacy. The minister's next figure was `a disgraceful 27.8 per cent' of our youth unemployed. He knows that is a fatuous statement, that the  27.8 per <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent of youth who are unemployed are those who are not in work or are not in training, and that the actual rate as a percentage of youth in those age groups is about seven per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Ross Gittins's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> just a few days ago very ably nailed this government, this minister and his colleagues for the fallacy they have been perpetrating. They run the same line here. Even in this House they run the rubbish that 27.8 per cent of youth are unemployed. It is obvious what this government is about in the reduction of funding for training and in the reduction of funding for employment projects. That unemployment figure will be increased, not decreased. Whatever the percentage of young unemployed is now, it will be increased. We inherited from those opposite some 188,000 unemployed youth. The number of youth unemployed is now around 98,000&mdash;I will stand corrected, but it is about 98,000. That is a dramatic decrease in the number; but the use of these percentages here is outrageous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to some of the other major points of this bill. No-one can believe the rock solid guarantee by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or the Minister for Industrial Relations that no-one will be worse off. We have seen in New Zealand, which is the model from which this legislation is drawn, that conditions there have been vastly reduced. Annual incomes have been reduced. Wage rates might have been increased, the wage rate component of annual income has gone up, but the loss of other entitlements, allowances and conditions has been absolute and direct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at one case surveyed by the Heylen Research Centre, we see that overtime rates have been reduced or abolished in 42 per cent of enterprises and have been raised in only seven per cent, special allowances have been cut in 29 per cent, sick leave has been cut in 15 per cent and the ability to accumulate leave has been cut in 29 per cent. That is the nature of the changes. But it all masquerades under the reference by those opposite and by proponents of the New Zealand degradation to it being an increase in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2200"> wages. The important factor is the decrease in annual incomes. So I strongly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Canberra. I commend the amendment to the House and I sincerely hope this legislation will be defeated. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a matter of considerable pride to me this morning to be able to rise in this House and address this historic piece of legislation, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. It is a piece of legislation which reflects the ideals over many years of the members on this side of the chamber to provide Australia with a framework for workplace relations which encourages cooperation rather than confrontation in the workplace and which will allow Australia to break out of the deadly cycle of low wages and high unemployment into which this country has been locked by the industrial relations policies of the previous government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one hears the comments from the other side of the House, one thinks of the statement about the Bourbon monarchs that they learnt nothing and they forgot nothing. Those opposite have clearly not learnt from their bitter experience in the last election that the Australian people are fed up with high unemployment continuing year after year, locked in at 8&half; per cent, fed up with the destruction of full-time job opportunities for young people and fed up with the pathetically low increases in real wages which have taken place over the last 13 years under the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people are desperate for some real sunlight, for some real hope and for some real opportunities for the future. This is going to take place only by a significant freeing up of the industrial relations arrangements and the dismantling of the privileges for the previous government's trade union mates which it has fought to protect down to the wire, even at the cost of its own electoral destruction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No issue during the last election campaign was more important than the issue of youth unemployment. We hear the bleatings from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the other side of the chamber that this is all a matter of definition. It is not. The figure of 27.8 per cent youth unemployment relates to those young people who are looking for full-time work and who cannot find it. We make no secret of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that over the last six years there has been an appallingly low level of full-time job creation in the Australian economy for all age groups. But no age group has suffered more than young people. It is the teenagers of this country on the streets, trying to occupy their time at pinball parlours, desperate for the opportunity to get some real training attached to part-time work, when they can find it, and unable to do so under the previous government's arrangements, who are desperately in need of assistance; and they knew that they would not get it from the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has taken the idealism and the vision of the new government to bring forward this historic piece of legislation, which will provide new rights and new opportunities to all those employed in workplaces around Australia and will provide new job opportunities and new training opportunities leading on to real jobs for the young people of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see those on the other side of the House refusing to accept this, standing by their privileges, standing by their failed system and trying to hold up and obstruct one of the clearest possible mandates that any government has had to introduce legislation of this kind, which we have foreshadowed for many years. This bill makes a significant contribution to the development of opportunities for young people, and it is that aspect of the bill that I particularly wish to address in my remarks this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the previous government staked, wrongly and falsely as it turned out, its hopes for re-election on shuffling young people through training programs that did not lead to real jobs, spending billions of dollars of taxpayers' money as a substitute for policies which would create real jobs. Because they could not create real jobs, they tried to hide the unemployed in these pretend and too often subsidised programs which simply did not lead to real employment for most young <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2201"> people. Those opposite set up a highly bureaucratic and complex training system which was very unattractive to the vast majority of small and medium sized business in this country and, through the unfair dismissals legislation, frightened most of these small and medium sized businesses out of being willing to take on new full-time employees and offering new opportunities for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is determined to set up a modern apprenticeship and traineeship system which will greatly expand those opportunities, which will be industry owned, which will be flexible, which will be non-bureaucratic, which will be devolved in its operation and which will provide new apprenticeships and new traineeships that currently do not exist, for both full-time and part-time employees. The system we propose will also provide a very wide range of new opportunities for schools to establish links with the workplaces and small businesses in their areas, and to provide combinations of employment and training which currently do not exist for students and young workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extraordinary that the opposition, which claims&mdash;increasingly holy&mdash;to represent blue&hyphen;collar voters in this country, should oppose these sorts of arrangements. No-one will benefit more from these than the unemployed young people concentrated&mdash;let this be said quite openly&mdash;very heavily in the electorates represented by the failed previous government. We can ask ourselves what the people in those electorates were doing over the past 13 years. The social problems are greater than ever in those electorates, yet it is quite clear that the previous government had nothing positive to offer through its training programs and its reforms except more welfare. It was unable to get business into those electorates; it was unable to get business moving in those electorates. It is because it failed its own core voters that it is now sitting in those sadly depleted numbers on the other side of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, through its modern apprenticeship and traineeship system, will deliver flexible training arrangements. It will provide training in new and emerging industries with new kinds of apprenticeships&mdash;not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> merely those in the traditional trade areas. It will address the issues which the previous government failed to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation we are discussing this morning has an important role to play in the establishment of the modern apprenticeship and traineeship system. It will do this by establishing the concept of workplace agreements through which these new training arrangements in the workplace can be established. Because of the dishonesty from the other side of the House, I should make it clear that this bill makes no change to existing arrangements for apprentices and trainees. It protects fully the employment conditions and the wages of young people in current apprenticeships and traineeships. The wages that they are currently paid on a weekly basis will still be paid on a weekly basis under this new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this new legislation, young people will still be able to move into the more traditional kinds of apprenticeships and access traineeships under the national training wage award. No change is being made to these arrangements under this legislation. This legislation will, however, establish clearly principles which will allow new training opportunities to come into existence and new kinds of  apprenticeships to be defined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The critical element of this legislation as it affects the modern apprenticeship and traineeship system exists in division 4, particularly as it applies to the treatment of training wages. This bill proposes that minimum wages for trainees and apprentices employed under Australian workplace agreements and certified agreements be based on productive time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not in itself a new principle. The payment of young people for their productive time in the workplace is a principle that has been agreed in the past by trade unions, by the ACTU, and by employer organisations. It is a principle that was agreed under the previous government. It is a principle that has been established through the awards of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It is a principle which is implemented in the award governing the national training wage and in the provisions for traineeships, such as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2202"> career start traineeships, in the Australian traineeship system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is nothing new whatever about this principle. The effort of those on the other side of the House to spread fear and anxiety amongst existing apprentices and trainees and to suggest to them that in some way their payments will be affected by the embodiment of this principle in legislation is totally and utterly false and disgraceful. It is an effort to undermine on a completely false basis support for these new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this principle in this legislation, however, it will be possible for employers and young people to agree on new kinds of training arrangements. They will be able to agree that there should be two or more days training attached to their employment conditions. They are not able to do this at present under the national training wage award, which confines them to only one day's training. That is not sufficient training in a number of new industries. The fact is that a number of employers are offering more than one day's training and are being required to pay as if this were not the case and they were getting four days productive work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other side says that this is good, as it is providing higher payments for these young people. But it is doing so at a cost. The cost is that many training and employment opportunities for young people are currently not coming into existence because many employers, particularly in the hard&hyphen;pressed small and medium sized business sectors, are not prepared to offer these arrangements under the existing legislation. This legislation provides them with the opportunity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the legislation, the determination of productive time and time spent in training will be made by an approving authority. This approving authority will be declared under the legislation by either the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Youth Affairs or the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approving authority has been made an essential part of the schema in this legislation because we are determined to make clear to employers and young people that what this government is concerned about, through the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> modern apprenticeship and traineeship system, is quality training. We are not interested in arrangements that are not bona fide and do not offer quality training to young people. We are interested in bona fide arrangements which offer quality training. The approving authority will be required to look at the combination of training and productive work and ensure that those arrangements offer appropriate training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the designation of these approving authorities, the guidelines that the government will be using and the ministers will use to ensure that an authority is appropriate for designation will make it clear that the approving authority must possess the appropriate skills to determine the balance between productive time in the workplace and training time. The guidelines will also make it clear that the approved training must be based on national competency standards leading to nationally recognised qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is fully aware of the fact that, from the enterprises' point of view, the existence of nationally recognised standards may or may not be a relevant factor. But I can assure this House that, from the point of view of the trainees, the portability of their qualifications and the quality of the qualifications they will get through this, we are very aware of their need to have those qualifications meet nationally recognised standards. It is because the guidelines will ensure that the approving authority must take this into account that we can be totally confident of our statement that the training which will be agreed to and approved by these approving authorities will be quality training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These authorities will be accountable to the minister. They must have no conflict of interest. They will be recognised by the community as being appropriate authorities to exercise power and authority under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has asked how we will know who will be certified for this. Let us be quite clear that the opposition, when in government, had no compunction in designating people such as the previous Premier of Victoria, the Hon. Joan Kirner, and president of the trade union movement, Bill Kelty, as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2203"> members of the Nettforce organisation to approve traineeship arrangements. I assure you that, unlike the previous government, we will be establishing a clear set of guidelines and making it clear that there are no conflicts of interest in those who will be designated as the approving authority.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me pleasure to enter this debate on the workplace relations bill. On the question of youth unemployment, I suggest that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> previous speaker, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), have a look at Ross Gittins' article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  last week which debunks completely his approach to definitional issues in terms of youth unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor opposes this bill because it is based on false assumptions. Chief amongst them are, firstly, the current IR system is built on a conflict model; secondly, the parties to the employment relationship have equal bargaining power; and, thirdly, flexibility does not exist in the current system. These false assumptions result in self&hyphen;serving conclusions and bad policy. Not only does it take us back to the conflict model but also it fails to deliver on the rock solid guarantee underpinning all of the coalition's pre&hyphen;election promises to protect take-home pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset of my contribution, I think it is worth while putting the accord achievements on the record because an effective industrial relations system must always balance efficiency considerations with equity considerations. Wages policy has to encourage competitiveness and productivity along with the fair distribution of national wealth for wage earners. It has to also provide protection for the most vulnerable. The accord delivered such an outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accord was not just a special deal for unionists, because advances in the social wage under the accord benefited the vast bulk of our community, unionists and non-unionists alike. The introduction of Medicare, the expansion of superannuation, improvements in family payments and child care, and the provision of maternity allowances, just to name a few&mdash;all of these improvements in living standards went to the great bulk of the community and, in particular, to the most needy. In return for the distribution, if you like, coming in this form, the trade union movement was prepared to exercise wage restraint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2204"> So the accord had a commitment to the broader society. It had a commitment to the unemployed, ensuring that wage claims were contingent on employment targets being met. It had a commitment to ensuring a more internationally competitive Australian econ omy. It had a commitment to ensuring that wage claims would be made consistent with securing a low inflation environment. It had a commitment to ensuring and providing the work force, with young people in particular in mind, with assistance to become more highly skilled and, through that commitment, to improving not only employment prospects&mdash;those 740,000 jobs that we talked about before&mdash;but also the competitiveness of industry itself. It was micro&hyphen;economic reform because it was about skilling the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The record of the accord does speak for itself. Over its term, the number of jobs increased by more than two million&mdash;a 33 three per cent increase in the work force in this country, the highest increase in jobs growth of any OECD country. Labour productivity per person rose by 35 per cent. Inflation came down from 11&half; per cent to an underlying rate today of 3.3 per cent. Wages growth&mdash;that is, real average weekly earnings&mdash;was up 7.2 per cent, with real household disposable income up 42 per cent. In terms of living standards, Australians are overall better off now than they were in 1981-82, when the Howard&hyphen;Fraser government was in office. We have seen an increase since that time in living standards of 73.1 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from the accord being a conflict model that was supported by the current industrial relations system, far from it being a conflict model with falling living standards, the accord actually delivered responsible wage outcomes, improved living standards and consistently low levels of industrial disputation. Industrial disputations are today down tenfold on what they were when Labor first came to power in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's accord based cooperative model stands in stark contrast to the new regime proposed by this bill. By reducing the role of unions and the capacity of employees to enter bargaining processes on an equal footing, the spirit of cooperation is eroded. Vulnerability, exploitation and insecurity will set in. A prime example of this in the bill is the proposal for wages for trainees and apprentices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the House of what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said on 7 January this year: `There is no way that we're going to go <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into the next election with anything remotely resembling a $3 youth wage.' He put out a document which said that the Australian workplace agreements would be a guarantee to protect take-home pay. Yet, under schedule 13 of the bill, it is possible that something very closely resembling the $3 an hour youth wage could occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the bill, the minister can designate just about anybody as an approving authority. They can then decide what constitutes `productive training'. Employers are required to pay trainees only for time spent on the job&mdash;that is again `productive'. So young people can effectively be made to work a full week but receive only two, three or four days pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have prepared a document which I seek the indulgence of the House to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for the purposes of underlining this point. I have raised it with the minister at table, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop). I seek leave at this stage to do that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not got time to read it into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . If they gave me an extension of time, I would. The tables I have not been able to incorporate into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  record reveal that, in industries and occupations that make up almost 75 per cent of youth employment&mdash;that is, in manufacturing, in retail, in clerical and in the accommodation, cafes and restaurant industry&mdash;new starters in the vast bulk of cases will be paid less under the Minister for Industrial Relations's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2205"> bill, under Peter Reith's bill, than they would be if there were no change, that is, even when they are the same age, doing the same job and are in the same training for the same amount of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New starters under the Reith bill who are required to spend a full 38&hyphen;hour week on the job but be paid for only half of that will normally receive around $3 for every hour on the job. For some, the rate will be as low as $2. This is against the promise of the Prime Minister that nothing remotely resembling the $3 an hour youth wage will be introduced under them. What cant, hypocrisy and dishonesty. They will not even allow us to have the documents that demonstrate that point incorporated in the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People will be worse off. Provisions relating to apprentices will allow similar discounting of their wages. This bill is nothing more than Jobsback in drag. At the 1993 election, when John Hewson tried to introduce Jobsback and Howard tried to foist upon us the $3 an hour minimum youth wage, they were rejected by the people. The government have dishonestly gone to the last election saying they will not introduce it&mdash;and they have brought it in in disguise. It is Jobsback in drag, as I say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to this point that all they are doing is discounting for the amount of time in training. The fact is that wages are already discounted for the time spent in non-productive training. For example, under the national training wage it is already recognised. Wage rates vary on the basis of the ratio of productive work to training. Primarily, it is an 80:20 split, but in some cases it can be 66:33 and in others 50:50, depending on the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went further than the national training wage in recognising that principle through the school based traineeships. The thing that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training wants to introduce, we have done. We introduced it on the basis of enabling students at school in years 11 or 12 to obtain training in schools, combined with up to 240 hours on&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training in the year, at no cost to the employer. So, under Labor's training agenda, there was plenty of flexibility <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the system. I do not quibble with the so&hyphen;called principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what we have under the Peter Reith bill is the ability to allow the discount not on the national training wage but on the junior rate. The employer will have an option to pick the lowest rate going. People should keep in mind that what we are doing is allowing the discount to be built into the training wage. They are going to allow a discount on the junior rate as well&mdash;and the junior rate is already discounted to take account of the person's age. So what we are getting is a double discount, a discount of the junior rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the legitimate training wage approach that we had, where we had the agreement of the commission and an award based set of wages and conditions. There was real, accredited training that had to be delivered. Under this legislation someone can say, `I think that person is really not worth as much to me because they need a lot of training. My assessment is that they need four days of training, but I will keep them in the job five days a week, assert that they are doing four days of it in training and pay them for one day of the week.' That is how they do this double deal in reducing youth wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the table that I was not able to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, you will see that that is how the figures are arrived at. It is a double whammy discount. Because they are providing for a double whammy discount, young people in particular&mdash;but all wage earners&mdash;can be worse off. It is interesting that the Minister for Industrial Relations has acknowledged that there could be problems. When answering a question from me in this House on 29 May he all but conceded that he could be wrong in saying that there would be no&hyphen;one worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His defence, interestingly enough, is that no&hyphen;one can be forced off an existing award. That has been repeated by the minister for vocational training in schools. He says&mdash;and he said it again in this debate&mdash;that no current employee can be forced off their existing rate. I acknowledge the importance of that commitment for current employees&mdash;and I hope it is delivered. But it ignores the fact that people who are not current employees are not given <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2206"> the same guarantee. The simple fact is that there are 370,000 young people each year under the age of 20 who take a new job. They are either entering the work force or changing jobs. They do not become current or existing employees. There are 800,000 people aged between 25 and 44 who also change their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Together, we are talking about 1.2 million people, one-quarter of the work force of this country, who will change jobs or enter new jobs in the course of the year. The whole work force will turn over in four years. So, even if the government is protecting existing employees in their current jobs, why won't they go the further step and guarantee the take&hyphen;home pay of those who change jobs or those who enter employment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the government will not do that because that is the stealth by which they are going to cut wages, especially youth wages. If the government are genuine about their election pledge guaranteeing to protect take&hyphen;home pay, what they will do in this House and what they will do in the bill is just have a guarantee not for existing employees but for all employees. That is what they should do. The simplest way to do that is to guarantee that no&hyphen;one will get less than the national training wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the rock solid guarantee is to mean anything, they have to do that. The amendments that we will be moving will seek to ensure that. We will be seeking the reinstatement of the genuine no&hyphen;disadvantage test for certified Australian workplace agreements and awards. We will also be going for existing trainees and apprentices to ensure that new entrants and people changing jobs can be no worse off than they are now under the national training wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's rhetoric is all about simplifying the system, cutting the red tape. Labor has already done this. Nettforce's role has already resulted in a hugely significant increase in traineeships. They have trebled in number. From July 1994 to July 1995&hyphen;1996, they went from 6,000 to 18,000. What we have done under Nettforce and the training agenda is get the product right. This is the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> demand for traineeships; this is businesses saying it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business which, it is argued, is going to be the biggest employer&mdash;and I agree with that&mdash;has created 2,350 traineeships in six months. The target was 2,000 in 12 months. It is now headed for a target of 7,000 by the end of the year. Small business is taking up in a huge way the agenda that Labor introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area consultative committees have given flexibility over the spending of the Labor market programs to assist in better targeting. If you look at their success rate, the 60 ACCs around the country were responsible for delivering 306,000 job opportunities in the course of 12 months. Apprenticeship commencements have gone from 34,000 to 53,000, and all that under Labor's training revolution. It is that revolution that is now in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have written to Nettforce. They are going to abolish this successful body that has trebled the rate of traineeships. They are getting rid of the good things. Why? Not because they have succeeded but because they were created by Labor&mdash;just as they have sacked Janet Holmes a Court, just as they want to get to these people. They are petty, they are mean&hyphen;minded. They want to attack these things no matter how good they have been or how internationally recognised they are. The government want to attack them because Labor created them. They are not prepared to look at the results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be seeking a guarantee that Nettforce not be sacked and a commitment that the area consultative committees are secure in getting the labour market program moneys as flexibly as before so that they can continue to carry out their job. We will also be seeking to ensure that the government honours its pre&hyphen;election promises that the labour market programs not be cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area that we are opposing is the coalition breaking its commitment to ensuring that no&hyphen;one will be worse off. This comes in the form of proposed section 152 of the bill. It says that federal awards are not binding on anyone covered now or later by state employment agreements. The fact is that those state <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2207"> agreements require far fewer minimum conditions than federal awards in a number of states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, in Victoria agreements are only required to provide five basic minima, including annual leave, sick leave and parental leave. Two recent studies of employment agreements in Victoria and Western Australia have shown that employees were being made to work longer hours, that penalty rates for overtime and shift work were being reduced, that very few agreements provide for pay increases and that employees in retail, hospitality and contract cleaning were the most affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This can all happen now under this new bill. We are saying that many award conditions will now disappear. The commitments&mdash;the guaranteed take&hyphen;home pay and that no&hyphen;one will be disadvantaged&mdash;will not happen. This is cutting workers' entitlements and cutting living standards by stealth. The present government were not honest to go to the election and tell people that their strategy for unemployment in this country was to cut people's wages, but it is what they are doing by virtue of this bill now. We are opposed to that approach. We will continue to resist it; we will be taking the opportunity in this House to move amendments to ensure that they honour the guarantee that no&hyphen;one will be worse off. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired) </EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Burke is like a rubber ducky: you squeeze him and he keeps popping out again. The real thing about this legislation is that it attempts to address the mind&hyphen;set being displayed through the remarks we have heard from the other side; that is, that in reality we are seeing a new direction in master&hyphen;servant relationships. I use that term in this sense: no longer are they master&hyphen;servant relationships but partnerships. They are equal in the sense of common goals. That is the design in the legislation. We have heard from the member for Hotham an outline of what has happened with the accords. He extolled the accords.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it got up to about 10 at one stage, or they were expecting it to before they lost government. The mem <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2208"> ber for Hotham was extolling the accord. But what the accord system did was entrench a wage&hyphen;price dichotomy. In other words, the workers would go out and get their wage increase, and then of course prices went up. So they were no better off. In fact, as we know, real wages dropped under that system. So it is no good coming in here and extolling the accord system; it did not work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what it did do was entrench the union bureaucracy, the ACTU bureaucracy or the union involvement in all these things when in fact the percentage of people who were unionised was dropping ever so rapidly. I will come to it soon, but I think that percentage is getting down to about the 30-per cent mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will provide not only greater work opportunities but also a comfort zone for workers. There will be minimum standards. That is quite clear in the bill. But we must realise that we are in the 20th century. When you hear some of the rhetoric coming from the other side, it is quite incredible. You would think that they are talking about the last century, and they frequently do that. The member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), for example, in his speech to this House stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is based on the assumption that the labour contract is just a contract like any other. Views like these threatened industrial peace and the rights and living standards of Australians in the 1890s.</PARA>
<PARA>That is where those opposite are still set; they are set in the 1890s. You have to ask yourselves why. Why don't we get a cooperative approach from the other side for what is really needed in this country? That is, a more workable industrial relations system&mdash;not confrontation but workable productivity, and a system that looks to get jobs as well. We all want to get jobs, don't we? Do those on the other side agree with that proposition or are they really saying, `No, we have a system that we're quite happy with because our bureaucratic mates in the union movement want to continue in their nice well paid jobs'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the philosophical direction that has been stated. In my submission, it is quite anachronistic. Look at the language of the member for Canberra. He states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is one thing you can definitely say about productivity in Australian workplaces. A bill consciously designed to attack the living standards of working men and women, to make them feel insecure . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That language is just absurd. It is just inconsistent with the bill, and it is designed to inflame. It is not designed to advance the argument one iota. Don't we have to move away from that to a more realistic approach, a pragmatic approach, to industrial relations in this country? That is what the opposition refuses to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can remember the history of confrontation that has occurred over the years&mdash;confrontation that has not advanced jobs but hindered them. We can recall over the years&mdash;and I myself can recall this personally&mdash;experiences of thuggish union officials, standover merchants in unionised work places, where you could not get a job without a union ticket. Are those opposite saying that that should still obtain, that you should not be able to get a job unless you have been made to join a union?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You do not hear them saying that any more. I believe that most of them still do subscribe to it, but they will not say it any more. It is not freedom, as remarked on by my colleague from Moreton. There are compulsory unionism, preference clauses, closed shops and all those things. How many young and older people could not get a job because they conscientiously objected to joining a union?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the position of independent contractors? I used to see truck drivers queuing up at the old Roma Street goods yards. One day some years ago I had a conversation with one. He told me the story of how he was running a truck&mdash;and everyone knows the margins that truck drivers are on; it is a very difficult job, long hours, high overheads&mdash;and was made to join a union. They would not load or unload his truck unless he joined a union, yet he was an independent contractor. Is that the sort of system that the members opposite want to sustain? It is unsustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did the system that those in the Labor Party evolved in their legislation, the Brereton <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2209"> legislation, work? Look at the Weipa dispute, the flouting of orders that occurred. It just did not work. Time and again, if the unions did not like an order that was made by the commission, they would just say, `Well, we're not going to follow that order; we'll go out and do what we like.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely the outcomes that will be achieved by this legislation are positive. In reality, getting away from the rhetoric, is it not the case that the bill tries to achieve the sorts of outcomes&mdash;I have mentioned them before&mdash;that will make for a genuine, lasting and equitable relationship in the workplace&mdash;voluntary unionism and prohibition on discrimination?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that the current President of the ACTU does recognise, albeit reluctantly, some advantage in the legislation's proposals. She said in an interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Face to Face</EMPHASIS> program: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other issue I raised is he always talks about freedom of people to choose, and I can live with that too . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So there is some reluctant concession, in relation to the general parameters of the bill and what it is trying to achieve, that there is something good there. It is good to see that there is that concession, albeit a fairly small one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the undoing of amalgamation if it is the wish of members. It is all about choice. Members of a union can establish autonomous enterprise branches if they wish. Again, that is a choice. Members will remember the decision in Moore v. Doyle which was handed down in 1974. That decision meant that from 1974 to 1988 all registered organisations had to provide for branch autonomy in their rules in any event. We have put that requirement into the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The compliance provisions of the bill provide for a speedy relief procedure. There is no bogging down in compulsory conciliation, and injunctive relief is available from the Federal Court and the superior courts. There is provision for a prohibition on paying or accepting strike pay. There are also secondary boycott provisions in this bill. These are good provisions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we get to the unfair dismissal farce. It was even recognised by the former Prime Minister during the election campaign that something had to be done about this. These provisions deprived young and older people of work. The examples were legion of how that legislation was being applied. What happened was that people in small and medium businesses were reluctant to take people on for fear that those provisions would be brought into play and they would be dragooned into a hearing, paying excessive legal costs. They frequently paid a small monetary settlement&mdash;sometimes a larger one, unfortunately&mdash;to get the whole thing out of the way so they could get on with their business. Surely, that shows that they did not work. Everybody, except those on the other side, knows that they did not work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other provisions in the bill relates to the Employment Advocate. It is interesting to reflect on how that will work, particularly how it will work for women. The member for Fremantle was complaining about this. The Employment Advocate has a general function of providing assistance and advice to employees about their rights and obligations. Are women not protected by this legislation? This will be particularly significant in relation to Australian workplace agreements. The advocate can provide workers considering an AWA with information to enable them to fully understand the proposed agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has been drafted to enable the advocate's advising and assisting functions to be contracted out. One option which has been given close consideration is to partially contract out some of the functions of the advocate to non-government community organisations. One of the advantages of that approach would be that, where workers are perhaps a little chary approaching a government bureaucracy for assistance with an employer, they could perhaps go to a subcontractor, who has been contracted to do some of the work of the Employment Advocate, to get some advice. Women may feel more comfortable with that. That may be the case particularly for women from non-English speaking backgrounds. They may feel more comfortable in seeking help from community <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2210"> based organisations. There are a number of women's working centres that could play a vital role in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also needs to be remembered when considering how the bill will help women that there will be benefits in balancing work and family. It is true that unions have resisted the insertion of part&hyphen;time provisions in awards despite the fact that women want part&hyphen;time work so that they can cope with the desires, needs and onerous responsibilities of running a family. It is interesting to note what is proposed in relation to carers leave. The provisions for carers leave are a minimum standard.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said by the very respected member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) that these are the forces of reaction. It is quite the opposite. The reactionaries are on the other side. There are more people, or at least as </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>many, with working&hyphen;class credentials on this side as on the other side of the House. That is reflected in the avalanche of the blue&hyphen;collar vote. I come from a largely working&hyphen;class electorate. There was an avalanche of blue&hyphen;collar voters voting for the conservative parties in this country at the last election because they saw the direction they wanted to be taken in. They do not want to be taken in the direction of confrontation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the greatest respect to the member for Charlton, he really has got it wrong, and that is where the reaction is. If you look at what `reactionary' means, it is the reaction from that side of the House. There is the member for Canberra, too, with his slash and burn descriptions&mdash;all this reactionary stuff. There can be no better comments on the legislation than those of Mr Michael Easson, ACTU vice&hyphen;president from 1993&hyphen;94 and NSW council secretary from 1989&hyphen;94. What did he say? As reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> on 14 June 1996, he said that the legislation was not radical or draconian. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't regard it as massively radical. It is moving further than the previous government would have done, but I think it is an incremental development.</PARA>
<PARA>If you look at the Working Nation statement in 1994 you will see that it is exactly that. Members opposite should re&hyphen;read that statement and then ask me, `Is this legislation much different from the general proposals in that statement?' Mr Easson goes on:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth about industrial relations is that, while you have 10 per cent unemployment, award conditions and wages will be eroded&mdash;it is inevitable. Unions will not be able to stop it except in very small areas. That is absolutely inevitable. No matter what anyone says, that is an irreversible tide. And that will happen as long as unemployment exists. I believe the only future for this country is as a high wage, high productivity, highly skilled country, and that is what we have not got. There is nothing in the legislation that will return us to that. Sadly, there was little in the performance of the previous government that took us down that road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no point at all in making a god of training. Yesterday, Rosemary Crowley told me that one of her constituents had said that he had had more training than a Russian circus clown. But for what? If the jobs are there, training is fine if the training is relevant. But, if the jobs are not there, training is also irrelevant. What we have seen in this country is a deskilling of the nation. We have seen this take place as a bipartisan arrangement because the Liberal Party and the Labor Party both subscribe to the doctrine of the future being in the service sector. We are told that the service sector is where our future lies. The service sector is code for `tourism'. Tourism is low&hyphen;paid jobs, part&hyphen;time jobs and jobs for women and kids. It is not jobs for blue&hyphen;collar workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> There have been some attacks on unions. I have been involved with unions most of my working life in one form or another, often in interunion arguments. Many unions are ex tremely hard working, extremely committed and extremely underresourced. Others are slovenly, incompetent and ideological&mdash;just like some of the ideological claptrap I have heard from speakers on the other side this morning. However, there is absolutely no doubt that things like preference clauses and closed shops were actually desired by many employers. They sought them because they were a very convenient arrangement for the employer. They would not have existed had that symbiosis not existed: the employer wanted it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard about independent contractors in the Transport Workers Union. Why should they be in the union? I can tell you why they are in the union. They are in the union for their protection, because there is no industry where contractors are screwed more ruthlessly than in the transport sector. We have seen a year by year improvement in productivity in the transport sector, but it is certainly not reflected in the income of those private contractors. In passing, I might say that their income could have been helped if there had been a bigger allocation of resources to road building in rural areas, but that was not the case with either party in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had some talks on the Kwinana Strip some time ago. The Kwinana Strip in Perth is where most of Australia's high&hyphen;speed aluminium boats are produced. Many people do not know that we are the world leader in producing high&hyphen;speed aluminium boats. We have about a third of the world market and we have the top third. We make the best and the most expensive boats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked one company down there, Oceanfast, what its union relations were like. I was told, `We don't have any. We are not against unions but that is entirely up to the workers. We are paying much over the award.' The truth was that of course they were paying over the award. The metal workers never went down there. They simply said, `What can we do? We can't do anything to these people.' So they stayed away. I believe that was a gross dereliction of their responsibility. Even more importantly, it was absolutely stupid because there was a lot they could have done.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2212">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The productivity that is developed down there, the new skills and the new export capacity are very dependent on the maintenance of the export bounty&mdash;an issue the unions could have done something about. If I were a union organiser I would have been down there all the time urging the workers to support the union so that the union could lobby in Canberra for the maintenance of that ship bounty, but that was not done. There are many areas where the unions have simply missed the direction in which they must be working. I see it happening all the time and it is a great shame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to do something about unemployment, we have to look at a return to manufacturing industry, because if that happens the workers will definitely be in a bargaining position, Clearly, under the government's legislation workers will be disadvantaged, and it is a nonsense to say otherwise. The individual will never have the clout to stand up to the company and its resources. But if a worker can walk down the road and get a job then that will give him real bargaining power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Creeping into the Australian political scene is an acceptance that eight per cent would be a great target for unemployment. That is not acceptable for the Australia I want. I want a very low rate of unemployment, and that means less than two per cent. That can be achieved in this country but only through decisive government action, and I see no sign of that coming from either of the present political parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am interested in the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) because he is one of our parliamentary ideologues; he comes to parliament with a view from which he never really deviates. In his speech he gave the previous Labor government credit for continuing over the last eight years some of the reforms commenced by the Prime Minister. He went on to say how fine those reforms were&mdash;deregulation, floating the dollar and the deregulation of banks that brought in competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deregulation of the banks caused the massive financial crisis that occurred. The banks behaved irresponsibly by buying market share and, as it turned out, made a lot of very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unwise loans. I agree with John Stone: the deregulation of the banks was too precipitous, without any checks and balances. To look on that as a good thing requires a large degree of ideology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He spoke about Whitlam's 25 per cent across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board tariff cut. I agree that that was a bad thing. How could you argue that the continuing down&hyphen;phasing of tariffs is good? I will tell you what the result of that has been under the Labor government. We decided that we would reduce tariffs on clothing and footwear in the apparel industry. We actually speeded it up. Of course, we succeeded in wiping it out&mdash;as was highly predictable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who has been the beneficiary of this? It has hardly been the public because the public in fact has got lower quality clothing priced at what the market will bear. There has not been a massive reduction in the cost of clothing; the price has simply been pitched at just below the price of the Australian product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tariff reduction has also seen a leap in the number of sweatshops in Australia. A friend of mine in Melbourne who is involved in the upper end of the clothing market recently told me that, under pressure from this outsourcing, she actually approached a Vietnamese group that was doing this and was told she would have to pay cash, otherwise it would interfere with their social security payments. That has been the great benefit to Australia of eliminating the clothing, footwear and textile industry in this country. I have trouble coming to grips with just what that does for society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One area of merit in the government's bill is the unfair dismissal clauses. It is my experience in small business that people do not, as a rule, employ people to sack or abuse them. I have no doubt that it happens in some cases, and it always will, but overwhelmingly the unfair dismissal clauses have been abused, and very often abused by bludgers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we will see an improvement in employment. I know lots of very good people in small business who at the moment are simply frightened to employ. That is not the case universally. Recently I spoke to one employer in Kalgoorlie who said, `Let's face <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2213"> it, if I don't like them, I'll make their life so difficult they'll leave anyway.' In the sort of business he was in, he may have been able to do that. But, by and large, the unfair dismissal situation as it exists means the law is unworkable and is counterproductive. I welcome the changes in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arguably, Australia used to produce the world's best metal trades apprentices who were regarded worldwide for their skills and the variety of their skills. That has simply disappeared to the stage where in Kalgoorlie now you cannot get a boilermaker for either love or money. Why? Because we stopped training boilermakers as we went down the service sector road&mdash;the Barry Jones vision for Australia. The truth is that, unlike lawyers and articled clerks, boilermakers lead to real productivity in the community. A boilermaker in Kalgoorlie creates real wealth and creates employment for others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in a factory in Adelaide that does precision engineering. The workers told me that wages were not the source of their problem. Their problem was that they could not get skilled machinists because we had stopped training them. The apprenticeship system had simply failed. The employer said, `Look at those people over there. If I hadn't got them out of the UK before the curtain came down, we would be out of business now.' Then he confided in me and said that we had less than 10 years, and that was a few years ago now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I then went to Bunbury and talked to the workers of a company that does the same sort of work on a much larger scale. I put what I was told in Adelaide to them, and they said, `We think they're lucky. We don't think we've got 10 years before we run out of those necessary skills.' If we start tomorrow, it is going to take six years before we get anything like those skills back into society. I think a start must be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find what the government's legislation proposes to do in terms of training for apprentices odd. If training is relevant, then training is good and it should be supported. If you are going to put the onus for that training&mdash;that is, the cost&mdash;on someone who is already receiving relatively low wages, you are going to see a reduction in training.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might just add that the government have announced that they have reduced skillshare training around the country. It is hard to know what the government expect from skillshare, because they have said that those skillshare agencies that do not have suitable outcomes will be disbanded. But the government have not defined what a suitable outcome is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some skillshare agencies in my electorate which I think would probably be deemed as not producing a suitable outcome. Those skillshare agencies are looking after the people, largely Aboriginals, who have been through the education system&mdash;through that education sausage machine&mdash;and have come out illiterate. Skillshare is teaching them to read and write; it is making them literate. Skillshare is doing a better job than the education system did and it is doing it cheaper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a great achievement in my view, but I can tell you what this government will do for reasons of political correctness. The government will hardly touch the Aboriginal affairs budget, but it will cut those agencies&mdash;unlike ATSIC&mdash;that are delivering real services to Aboriginals. Certainly, in my electorate, skillshare is one of those things that delivers real, tangible results to Aboriginal people. The sad thing is that the government will not even realise what it is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the speech of the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), and I must say that she is a great speaker. She talked about women in the work force. I get a bit sick of this notion that women are underprivileged. The truth is that, for as long as our society has existed, middle class women have always been better off than working class men. Inevitably, at the bottom of the heap we find working class women, but there is scant regard for working class women in this. What I see happening from a lot of this tirade about the consideration of women is the enhancement of middle class women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that there are many women in the work force who are in the work force because of economic desperation. They would in fact much rather be at home looking after their families. The previous government went some way towards achieving that in its social <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2214"> security legislation, but I believe we can go a lot further. I believe that it is worth looking at making a payment to women who want to stay home and look after their families, because the social gains from that could make that a very good investment for society. I think something like that should be considered, though it is unlikely of course that it will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the mining industry, we have seen year on year improvement in productivity, and we have seen year on year improvement in export earnings. That is a great record. What has that delivered to the worker? It has, in some cases, delivered high wages. It has also delivered a reduction in employment. We are the world's most efficient miners, and that means we keep getting more and more recognised and keep employing fewer and fewer people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the mining industry is absolutely vital to Australia for its export earning potential, there is another section of the industry which, in my view, is not being exploited&mdash;that is, the industry's capacity to employ people in the manufacturing sector in Australia. When we do this, we do it well and our products are successful. It should be remembered that, in the mining industry, better is the same as cheaper, and we in Australia certainly do it better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CSIRO figures suggest that every year Australia imports about $1.2 billion worth of goods from the mining industry that we could have made in Australia better or cheaper. That is not happening, and one has to ask why. There are three factors you need for successful industry. The first is a large customer. In Australia, we have the world's largest customers. The second is a state-of-the-art customer. We are the best miners in the world&mdash;certainly the best hard rock miners in the world. The third is government will. In this parliament, there is simply no government will to establish that sort of industry. If there were, it could and would have happened.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join this debate on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, otherwise referred to as the industrial relations bill, and to speak in support of the bill. Before I do that, while he is in the chamber, I want to briefly touch on some of the matters that the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) raised. I was astounded to hear the honourable member say that the reason for preference clauses and for closed shops is that employers requested them. That has made me so angry because he has no idea. What else would you expect from an employer who gets a phone call from the Maritime Union, telling him that he has some containers on the waterfront and asking whether his members of staff are members of the union? If the employer says, `I don't know. Some may be; some may not be&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZK6">Mr ZAMMIT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay, Mr Deputy Speaker. The second matter he raised was the question of the worker. What is a worker? Does the honourable member for Kalgoorlie think that the worker is only the person, however hard they might work, who is digging up roads or working in the mines? What about the rest of Australia? He made some very disparaging remarks about solicitors and lawyers. My wife is a solicitor, and I can tell the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, having seen how hard she and her colleagues work, what a tough profession it is, how much they are under constant pressure and what very long hours they put in. I think what the honourable member said is disgraceful, and I urge him to consider making a retraction when he has the opportunity in this parliament, later this evening perhaps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third matter that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie raised was skillshare. He gets stuck into the coalition government for the funding of skillshare and makes no mention of the fact that it was the former government and the former minister who allowed that to occur. They spent the 12&hyphen;month budget in nine months. All of a sudden we come to government and skillshare says it has no money. Why does the honourable member for Kalgoorlie not make mention of what has occurred in the past? He is so much out of touch. I suggest to the honourable member that he should really think about things that he says in this parliament because there are some of us here who feel very strongly that what has occurred in the past, the pain and misery that have been inflicted on so many Australians, has resulted in a massive win to the coalition government&mdash;not just a landslide but an avalanche, as it was recently referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the very outset, I want to congratulate the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), who has produced a bill that is comprehensive, balanced and visionary. I believe it will see Australian employees and employers head into the 21st century in a spirit of cooperation and goodwill, side by side in a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> modern&hyphen;day framework to enable Australia to meet the requirements of competitive environments, especially in regard to the mounting pressures Australia faces in a fiercely competitive world economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The emphasis of this bill is on the lessening of the tensions and the conflict which the adversarial nature of the existing act produces between employees, employers, trade unions and employer organisations&mdash;in fact, between the trade unions and their own members&mdash;and the bill emphasises an increase in cooperation in a spirit of goodwill and teamwork.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Few other aspects of the existing act characterise this conflict more than the unfair dismissal provisions. The new emphasis will be on fair dismissals with built&hyphen;in safeguards for employees and employers. While going around campaigning, talking to business people and to employees, I have found that nothing has caused greater stress in the Australian workplace than the matter of unfair dismissals. I am glad to see that the member for Kalgoorlie at least got that right in his view of the former government's attitude to unfair dismissals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can quote many examples of what has occurred, and I will do so because I have time this morning to refer to what has been brought to my attention&mdash;from small firms, from medium size firms and from larger firms. Because of the requirements of the act, what has occurred is that employers have had to have a file on their employees to document when employees have done something wrong to make sure that they follow the act in regard to the steps that they may or may not have to take in deciding whether an employee is no longer fulfilling his or her obligations. As a result of that, the employees, in an effort to protect themselves, have had to start their own files on the actions that they have taken in response to any accusations levelled at them by their employer. In fact, medium sized and large companies have now decided that the best way to ensure that there are fewer tensions for all levels of their management is to employ an industrial relations officer to advise the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of that the employer has now had to go a step further, on the advice of their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2216"> legal advisers and on the advice of their industrial relations officer, and start files on very long-term employees, people whom they have absolute faith and trust in. The employers are told, `In the future it may well occur that that employee may change, may cause you problems and may not work satisfactorily. Then you will have to start off a new file on the person, so you'd better do it now.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reluctantly, a lot of firms are starting files on long-term employees. Once the long-term employees get a whiff of it, they start their own files. It is one of the most disgraceful episodes I have seen in workplace relations between employers and employees. As a result of that, a lot of companies that see a bit of an upturn in the economy and find that the business may be going a little better choose not to employ additional people, because they do not want to be in a situation where they will be forced to have to put off people and face the consequences of doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give one example of that. A lady phoned me and said that she called in her manager and, one on one, said to that person, `Things aren't working out. I don't think you're satisfactory for the position.' He said nothing other than, `Well, if that's how you feel about it.' She said, `Yes, I do. I'm prepared to pay you what is rightfully yours.' He said, `Fine.' She said, `I'd like you to go.' He said, `Fine.' He left. There was nothing other than that from him. He did not question that or he did not say anything further about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few days later she got a phone call from her solicitor. She was told that her solicitor received from the employee's solicitor a letter saying that the employee would go if she paid him half a year's salary, which is in the vicinity of $22,000. She said to me, `I just haven't got that sort of money. I'm stretched to the limit. I can't find that $20,000 to pay that person, who in fact agreed with me that he had to leave when I said that he had to go. His version of events is that I sacked him, and I didn't do that.' These are some of the problems that have been caused by those opposite. The Australian Labor Party has achieved mistrust and a very combative environment in the workplace environment <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which is in no-one's interest. This bill addresses that very important matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am wondering about some of the statements made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who is still in the chamber. He mentioned the great involvement by some of the leadership of the trade union movement. I can only say that that is not the view I have from this side and that is not the view of my constituents. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie is shaking his head. Why is it that the membership of the trade union movement has dropped dramatically from 41 per cent in 1988 to less than 33 per cent today&mdash;an all&hyphen;time low? Australian workers are crying out for a new deal. They voted for the coalition in unprecedented numbers because they wanted a new deal and they wanted a new way of approaching workplace relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn now to the issue of compliance provisions and in particular I want to refer to the matter of secondary boycotts, previously known as section 45D and section 45E of the Trade Practices Act. Secondary boycotts will not be permitted under these new provisions before the House. Additionally, civil liability will again come into effect with regard to unlawful industrial action. This bill will provide the legislative capacity for aggrieved business enterprises to protect their interests and the interests of their employees. Further, the Australian community will be guaranteed that the government will take immediate action to protect them against any strike action by unions that may threaten their health, their safety and/or their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue I want to raise is compulsory unionism. I touched on it earlier in my speech and I want to touch on it again. Those opposite will say, as they have said repeatedly, that there is no such thing as compulsory unionism. It is about time we debunked that myth. Because of the existing preference clauses and closed shop regimes, nearly all union members have had only one choice if they wanted a job&mdash;to `voluntarily' offer to join the union. In what way can one refer to this practice other than by calling it compulsory unionism&mdash;admittedly de facto compulsory unionism, but nonetheless compulsory unionism?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2217">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the contribution last week or the week before by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who is also in the chamber. He referred to his membership of the union movement. From my recollection, he said that he has been a member since he was 17. He nods in agreement. He has been a member for a very long time; I will not quote how many years he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard him say how proud he was of his membership and he spoke in support of the unions. That is fine; that is well and good. Of course, no-one can deny his support and love of the trade union movement; he is entitled to that view. That is fine; I have no argument with that. However, I listened very intently and very carefully to what he had to say. I noted that at no stage in his address to this parliament did he mention the problems of the business community. Why not? Why didn't he refer to the business community and to the massive problems that they face which resulted in the largest number of bankruptcies last year in the history of this nation? The business community are hanging on by their fingertips, displaying a stiff upper lip and hoping for better times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government were not governing for the whole of Australia. They were concerned with only their relationship with the trade union movement. The honourable member for Cunningham said that the coalition was, in his words, `intent on smashing the unions'. Earlier I quoted figures that showed categorically that the workers of Australia are deserting the trade union movement in unprecedented numbers. If anyone is smashing the unions, it is the workers. They do not see the trade union movement today as standing up for their rights. If any group or association should take responsibility for the drop in union membership, it is the union leadership, which have brought this on themselves, aided and abetted by 13 years of Hawke-Keating-Beazley Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Cunningham went on to say that the number of strikes in Australia has fallen. There is no question about that. There has been a sustained fall in the number of working days lost in the past few years in Australia. There is no question <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about that. We on this side of the House have no dispute with that assertion. However, the honourable member for Cunningham continues to mislead, either consciously or subconsciously, by his omission of certain facts, thereby continuing to adhere to his party line that things have never been better in Australia as far as working days lost through strikes are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can mislead just as much by an act of omission as an act of commission. The honourable member for Cunningham left out the fact that the reduction in strikes can be directly attributed to the huge unemployment rate we have in Australia. We have one million unemployed, not including the hundreds of thousands of Australians who are the hidden unemployed and have simply given up and do not appear anywhere in the statistics.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Cunningham interjects, so I will make further reference to some of the other things he raised in his speech. He mentioned that the dire economic circumstances we face in Australia are not the result of 13 years of Labor misrule. What he did not say is that, in the past, Australia was in the top level of OECD nations which have the least number of days lost in strikes. We are now languishing somewhere in the middle of the OECD nations. We are now ranked just average.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition was elected on 2 March because Australians were fed up with Australia moving slowly in either second or third gear. They want the very best from Australia. They demand excellence. They expect us to move into top gear. That is why Labor lost such a substantial number of seats and we had a change in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite have also raised the issue of monopolies. They are very quick to attack monopolies, quick to attack monopolistic practices. We on this side are equally and just as vociferously opposed to monopolies, whether they be in the sphere of business enterprise or they be organisational monopolies. In fact, several legislative provisions are in place to avoid such practices. The bill before the House will remove the monopoly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2218"> which registered unions currently enjoy. If it is fair enough for those opposite to attack business and organisations that have monopolistic tendencies, why is it unfair and unjust to remove the monopoly from the trade union movement in employing staff? The right to expect that individuals and organisations will not be ripped off or intimidated and freedom of choice are paramount in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have only a minute or so left to speak, so I conclude my remarks by saying that the Hon. Peter Reith has put forward what I think is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we will see in this parliament for a very long time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, which is now before the House, represents a massively retrograde step for industrial relations in this country. This is because this bill is built on a completely false interpretation of the outcomes of the current industrial relations system, is built on a totally unreal notion of the nature of workplace relations in this country, completely breaches a number of key coalition election promises, is viciously anti-union, makes a mockery of our obligations under ILO conventions that we have ratified, will eliminate the capacity of the Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate to ensure equal actual pay for work of equal value and will considerably reduce the level of fairness and equity in the industrial relations system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me elaborate on some of those points&mdash;firstly in regard to the false assessment by the government of the outcomes from the current industrial relations system. The second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) contains a number of allegations about the supposed failures of the present industrial relations system, especially as it applied under the Labor government. He says the system is conflict oriented and has created a relatively high level of industrial disputation; has reduced real wages and workers' living standards; has contributed to our levels of unemployment, including youth <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployment; has made our workplaces unproductive; and has caused the manufacturing industry to be uncompetitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From that we are told the current industrial relations system does not work, that the accord was a failure and that Australia needs a fresh start, which this bill will provide. These are just straight&hyphen;out assertions with no attempt whatever at analysis or justification by the minister. That is because they fly completely in the face of the facts. Let me just look at some of the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assertion that the system is conflict oriented is utterly at variance with the reality of the last dozen years, which has seen a dramatic reduction in the level of industrial conflict. The average number of working days lost per 1,000 employees in the Fraser government's term of office was 590. Under Labor, over our whole 13 years it was 202, which is a reduction of two-thirds. On top of that, through that period, the level of industrial conflict was declining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the last year of substantial economic growth under the Fraser government. In 1981, the average number of days lost per 1,000 employees was 797. In 1994, which was a year of strong economic growth under us, it was 76, or one&hyphen;tenth of the previous figure. In 1985, it was similar: it was 82. One-tenth the level of industrial conflict prevailed under us as compared with the period of the Fraser government when there was substantial economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the lowest levels of industrial conflict since 1940 and since we started compiling figures on this basis. How can you possibly argue, as the Minister for Industrial Relations does, that we need to change the system because it is conflict oriented and is producing high levels of industrial disputation. It is a nonsense proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has claimed that the industrial relations system reduced real wages and workers' living standards during Labor's period in office. That is just plain wrong and is a complete lie. The constant repetition of it does not make it any more correct. The fact is that real average weekly earnings for full-time adults increased in Labor's period of office by 7.3 per cent and real average weekly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2219"> ordinary time earnings for full-time adults increased by 5.9 per cent. So real wages are up six to seven per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This did not include the additional pay that many workers receive by way of superannuation. The percentage of workers covered by superannuation in Labor's period of office went from 40 per cent to 90 per cent of employees. Half the number of employees gained superannuation. That half now enjoys an additional six per cent of pay if employed by a large employer or five per cent for a small employer. The five per cent is about to go to six per cent next month. Over the whole period for these workers who got the superannuation addition and had the average pay increase, there has been a 13 per cent increase or a one per cent per annum increase. That is a far different picture from the reduced real wages continually claimed by the Minister for Industrial Relations and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, low wage earners with families benefited massively from such things as the additional family payments, which provide low wage families with up to $100 per week extra if they have two children or more. There are also immense benefits through the so-called social wage, which played a significant part under the accord. That includes measures such as Medicare, which gives free access to medical or hospital care, Austudy and the doubling of the number of university places. There has been a massive increase in the number of child&hyphen;care places, with substantial fee relief given by the child-care rebate. There is also a whole host of other things that I do not have time to mention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Fraser government, this social wage expenditure was reduced in real terms per person by 17 per cent. Under Labor, it increased in real terms per person by 73 per cent. All that improved the living standards of the working people of this country. So much for this minister's ignorant twaddle about declining living standards for workers under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been asserted that the industrial relations system is to blame for unemployment and youth unemployment. The fact is that under the accord Australia achieved far more rapid employment growth than under the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Fraser government. Under Labor, the number of people in jobs increased by 2,040,000. That is an annual rate of growth of 2.2 per cent compared with 0.8 per cent growth per annum under the Fraser government. That is growth almost three times as fast under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our last term of office, we increased employment by 735,000, or 3.3 per cent per annum. That is an extraordinary rate of growth of employment. Employment growth under Labor was faster than in all other OECD countries. In our last three years, Labor's employment growth rate of 3.3 per cent compared with an average for Western developed countries in the OECD of 0.6 per cent. We have had more than 5&half; times the rate of growth of employment than in other Western developed countries. We are told that our industrial relations system is stopping employment growth in this country. What absolute arrant nonsense. If we failed on employment growth, what does that say about the previous government and all the other Western countries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly the unemployment rate is still 8.5 per cent. This is largely because of the rapid rise in the work force participation rate. We have not only a growing population but a growing proportion of the population that wants to work. If that participation rate had remained constant, the unemployment rate today would be four per cent, not 8&half; per cent. This current government will find out that that rising participation rate makes it very hard to make any headway against reducing unemployment rapidly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that it is a disgrace that we have such a high youth unemployment rate. We are never told by the government that the actual number of youth unemployed today is 70,000 less than it was when we came into office 13 years ago. When we came in, it was 158,000. The actual number of youth unemployed when Labor went out of office was 90,000, which is a reduction of 68,000, or almost half. That is the real story on youth unemployment. Let us hear no more of this nonsense we continually hear about how we have done nothing about reducing the disgraceful youth unemployment rate. We have massively reduced it. The fact is that most of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2220"> the youth today are in universities and schools, not in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This rapid employment growth was the result of rapid economic growth. Under the accord, the Australian economy grew by 60 per cent in real terms. There was an average rate of growth of 3.7 per cent per annum, which is about twice that of the previous government. It is the fastest rate of growth for all OECD countries. In Labor's last term of office, GDP grew by 14 per cent or 4&half; per cent per annum, which is more than twice the rate of growth of the OECD. Australia's rate of growth was twice that of the OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We achieved a record period of 4&frac34; years of continuous growth to this point. As well as strong employment and  economic growth, Australia has been experiencing strong productivity growth. Real GDP per hour worked in the non-farm market sector of the economy has increased on a trend basis by 16 per cent over the period of this continuous recovery. That is 3.1 per cent per annum. That is very strong productivity growth. In the last year, it has been 5.1 per cent per annum, yet the Minister for Industrial Relations tells us that our workplaces are unproductive and we need to change the system because we cannot get increased productivity. What an absolute denial of the facts. It is a complete assertion against all the facts and evidence that is available to him. An important reason for this strong increase in productivity is the changes made in the industrial relations system by the Labor government. The move to enterprise bargaining has greatly expanded the opportunity for companies to bargain productivity increases for pay rises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By December 1995, we had around 7,000 certified agreements with the rate of growth of such agreements increasing rapidly. Over one-third of agreements certified by the Industrial Relations Commission were for small business, those with less than 20 employees. Over 50 per cent of employees under federal awards are now in formalised enterprise agreements. The Department of Industrial Relations' survey of workplace bargaining in 1994 found that 80 per cent of managers at workplaces with a new workplace agreement said that productivity had been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increased because of the agreement. So there is no doubt that the strong rise in productivity in recent times has been at least partly due to the rapid expansion of workplace bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for manufacturing being uncompetitive&mdash;where has this guy been? Australia's international competitiveness increased by 40 per cent under Labor, which has enabled our exports of elaborately transformed manufactures to grow at a rate of 14 per cent per annum over the last decade&mdash;enormous growth&mdash;and to increase from 13 per cent of our total exports to 22 per cent. So much for our manufacturing industry being uncompetitive because of our awful industrial relations system!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is also based on false notions of workplace relations. In his second reading speech, the minister alleged that the current system was deficient because it paternalistically presumed employees were incapable of understanding or protecting their own interests without the involvement of unions and industrial tribunals and that the system was serving the interests of those involved in it rather than the people it was supposed to serve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, these are totally unsubstantiated allegations. It is certainly the case that the present system presumes that the right of employees to take collective action through unions and the operations of industrial tribunals is important to protect the interests of many individuals. This is hardly paternalism, rather it is a realistic assessment of the relative power of employers and employees in many workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can anyone seriously argue that a young teenager who has just left school and who is looking for a job with any sort of employer, large or small, is in an equal bargaining position with that employer? Can you say that a long-term unemployed person who is desperate for a job is in an equal bargaining position with any employer? Can you say that an unskilled person who is competing with a lot of other people for the job is in an equal bargaining position with any employer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just nonsense to suggest that there is this kind of equality. But the assumption that there is some kind of equality underlies this bill. The notion that there is some kind of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2221"> bargaining equality between the employer and the individual employee, which this bill encompasses, is simply absolutely unreal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are often told that the additional flexibility that such a system will bring to the labour market will greatly improve our economic performance and lead to higher wages. But where is the evidence of that? People say, `Look to New Zealand. Have a look at New Zealand's economic and employment growth since it brought in employment contracts in 1991. Its economic and employment growth is similar to Australia, but look at what has happened to its productivity.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia productivity has grown by 7.7 per cent in terms of GDP per hour worked and in New Zealand it has grown by 5.2 per cent&mdash;so it is much stronger in Australia. Real wages&mdash;which are supposed to really grow under an individual contract system according to the Minister for Industrial Relations&mdash;have been static in New Zealand. They have hardly increased at all&mdash;0.1 per cent. When compared with the same period for Australia, we had a 4.6 per cent increase. So where is this great benefit of increased real wages coming from individual contracts? New Zealand has had static real wages and a considerable loss of award conditions of employment that employees previously enjoyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to breaches of election promises. The bill seeks to simplify awards by limiting them to 18 provisions. Everything else will be stripped out and be the subject of bargaining or managerial prerogative. That is a complete breach of the policy promise to encourage less complex awards. Let me briefly mention the policy produced on 18 February which said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where employers and employees jointly have decided that they wish their award&hyphen;governed relationship to continue, they will be encouraged to restructure the relevant award on a more flexible basis.</PARA>
<PARA>But this bill is not about encouragement; this is enforcement. It simply says you cannot have the award that you used to have; you have to have it simplified. It is not a matter of encouraging you to do it by some kind of agreement, all that has gone. So this is a complete breach of a promise.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that the bill does not give effect to the promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that employees will be given the choice to remain with the current award system and his further promise that he stands for an effective choice between the award and the workplace agreement. These promises are not honoured. Employees cannot remain with the current award system because it will not exist. He said that they can stay with the current award system, but it does not exist because the number of items in it will be vastly reduced. What will exist will be a restricted award which will deprive employees of the rights they previously enjoyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employees will not have an effective choice between the award and an agreement. If they want the conditions that are stripped out of awards, they must obtain the agreement of the employer. So they are forced into agreements. If it is an Australian workplace agreement under this act, then it replaces the award entirely. So, in trying to get back their previous award provisions, they can lose the award entirely. Some effective choice that is!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does not give effect to the Prime Minister's supposed rock solid guarantee that the take-home pay of workers cannot be less than the award or to his promise that under a Howard government you cannot be worse off but you can be better off. This is demonstrated by a number of provisions in the bill. Firstly, the bill provides for awards to be limited to 18 conditions. This will mean that workers will be worse off because of loss of award provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Things like service increments to pay will not be there because you have only a single minimum hourly rate for each classification. Protective clothing, occupational health and safety provisions, meal breaks, pay for meal breaks, breaks between shifts, study leave, union picnic days, the introduction of change provisions and many others will not be there. If employers choose to remove such provisions, then employees will be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision for state agreements to override awards means that many employees will be worse off. In Victoria, state agreements need only meet five conditions: a minimum array of wage rates, a mere five <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2222"> days sick leave, four weeks annual leave, unpaid maternity leave and long service leave. Everything else in the award is up for grabs&mdash;loadings, penalty rates, allowances, redundancy pay, notice of termination. So there is no protection there if such agreements can override the award. The Prime Minister's guarantee does not look very rock solid to these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the Australian workplace agreements have as the minimum condition that wages paid under the agreement must be no less than would have been paid under the award for the hours worked in that period, this does not protect their current actual rates of pay if they are above the award. So they could be paid less than they are currently getting without breaching the Australian workplace agreement requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Supposed protection comes only through providing that the employee can ask the employer to compare the wages being paid with the award entitlement and to make up any shortfall. He has to ask&mdash;which he, obviously, would be very loathe to do&mdash;and then the employer determines whether there is any shortfall. Some protection and rock solid guarantee! There is a vast array of other means by which employees may be made worse off, including such things as the abolition of minimum and maximum hours of part&hyphen;time work, provision to pay apprentices only for their productive time at work and the abolition of the no disadvantage test for certified agreements with its replacement by a requirement that the terms and conditions of employment may be no less favourable than the conditions for agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another way is the secretive nature of filing arrangements for workplace agreements, involving no vetting of agreements by the Employment Advocate or by anyone else, with just the employer's declaration that the minimum requirements have been met. Since that requires some value judgments it is wide open to exploitation. So for a large number of reasons, the rock solid guarantee and the no worse off promise are completely dishonoured by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further breach of promise relates, importantly, to superannuation. The government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> promised, prior to the election, that superannuation would remain in awards. They said that in the IR policy and in the superannuation policy. But what this bill does is take it out of awards; it is no longer to be an award provision. So it is a complete repudiation of the policy. Although the superannuation guarantee legislation means that loss of award super will not generally reduce workers' entitlements, it does mean that some super award provisions beyond the super guarantee charge will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also means that award provisions about allowable funds for receipt of superannuation contributions will be abolished and that choice of fund will be a complete managerial prerogative, except where it is the subject of agreement. This provision undoubtedly is aimed at industry funds about which the government seems to have a large ideological hang&hyphen;up. Furthermore, and most importantly, the removal of super from awards also means that the previous government's proposal for compulsory employee superannuation contributions to be introduced through awards cannot proceed. You cannot do it because the awards will not contain super. The government should therefore advise the nation as soon as possible what it intends to do about compulsory employee superannuation contributions, whether it intends to go through with them or not. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join this debate, although I have to say at the beginning that it is sad to hear an ex&hyphen;Treasurer chanting the failed mantras of the past, trying to defend the failed complexity of the system of industrial relations that we had in this country, talking about things like union picnic days. I can only say to him that the world has moved on and it is time Australia caught up with the rest of the world. We hear this fervour about the them and us mentality, that all employers are great exploiters of the working class. We have gone beyond that. This is the language of the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2223"> It is time to move into the 21st century. In that regard I congratulate wholeheartedly the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for bringing down this magnificent bill on work place relations. It has been sorely needed in this country. The way they have gone about it is colossal. The consultation that the minister has undertaken with all parties before bringing this bill to the parliament is unprecedented. He has even gone to the union officials and consulted them. It is the first time that it has happened. They were absolutely shocked&mdash;it has never happened before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this work, we have a piece of legislation that, if everybody admitted it, is acceptable to all parties, particularly the working people of Australia. It is a magnificent piece of legislation. When we took it to the Australian people on 2 March we got just about the clearest and most decisive mandate in Australia's history to introduce it into the parliament. I think it is the most important piece of legislation to come to the parliament for decades, certainly in my time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the industrial relations area it would be the most important piece of legislation to come in since the 1907 Harvester case. That took Australia from being in the top three in the world to being down the end of the OECD scale today. This piece of legislation is going to reverse that process and move Australia towards the top of the list again. I am proud that that is the case. Under the previous minister, Laurie Brereton, real wages fell in this country, productivity was erratic despite the great advances we have seen across the world in technology, the gap between rich and poor has widened in Australia and higher unemployment was the order of the day&mdash;becoming entrenched at higher and higher levels. In the last six years, fewer than 30,000 full&hyphen;time jobs have been created&mdash;a very sad record, indeed. Under the previous minister certain aspects of the legislation, such as the unfair dismissals legislation which I will talk about later, created great misery for many hardworking families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is landmark legislation. It is all about better work for better pay. It is going to create a freer workplace where there is more choice for the worker. It will lead to a happier and more prosperous Australia where we can start to climb back up the international ladder of success and prosperity. We can do that just by simple measures such as removing the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> elements of coercion that exist now in the Industrial Relations Act, letting workers make their own choices, look after their own needs and look to the concerns and preferences of their families. For the first time in this country, women and young people will be able to take on permanent part&hyphen;time work in all areas. They will be able to split their jobs and vary their hours if both sides are happy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed act is breathtakingly simple. It is no big deal. There is no coercion involved. For the first time in this country employees will be treated as individuals, as intelligent people able to make their own decisions and choices. The bill returns to the hands of the working class a power which has not been there for many decades in this country. That is good not only for those individuals but also for the companies and businesses that they work for. Ultimately, it will good for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I do not know how properly to explain the culture change that is needed. One way is to draw an analogy with our attitude to sport in this country. Generally speaking, we all have the right attitude to sport: we aspire to be the best in the world. If we are not the best in the world in some sport we will try to do something about it. We will go the extra mile in training; we will go the extra hour in training. We will pull in the world's best coaches. I remember the steps we took after the Montreal Olympic Games in 1976 to put Australia back at the top.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We lead the world in so many areas despite being such a small country in population, and we are proud of our achievements. For example, if the world record for the mile were around three minutes and 45 seconds and our athletes were 10 per cent off the pace and were running it in four minutes and 7.5 seconds, or if they were 20 per cent off the pace and were running it in four minutes and 30 seconds&mdash;schoolboys' stuff&mdash;there would be a national scandal. We would be shamed in the sporting pages of this country, and we would move to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to the things that really count in this country&mdash;such as the productivity of this country, the output of this country, putting dollars in workers' pockets, putting <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2224"> profits back into businesses, putting bread in people's mouths and lifting the standard of living in this country&mdash;we seem to have the opposite attitude. We create structures, rules and regulations that put obstacles in the way of people being able to enjoy a better standard of living for themselves. We have demarcation disputes, `go slow' tactics, even sabotage, in the workplace. It is amazing that we have this attitude to the things that really matter yet we have the opposite and proper attitude to the things we enjoy, like sport. Why can we not start to reverse this situation so that we have the good things for everything? The rest of the world is already doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, let us compare Australian ports with the ports around the world. The other day I heard the example of some steel from BHP that took 38 hours to load in Australia yet it was unloaded in New Zealand, at some obscure port with equipment of a far lower standard than exists in Australia, in five hours and for a fraction of the cost per tonne. Some would say that the workers in New Zealand were being exploited. The average wage of the Australian wharf labourers who loaded it was, I think, in the order of $75,000. The average wage of the New Zealand workers who unloaded it was $65,000&mdash;$10,000 less but you could hardly say they were being exploited. At least they had a job. New Zealand is getting back into the race again, and Australia has got to start to join them. That is the sort of thing that we are talking about in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the point of view of the Labor opposition to all this? It is to oppose the bill. We heard that the shadow minister is going to propose 200&hyphen;odd amendments. They say they will not go ahead with the bill because it does not give a rock solid guarantee that no&hyphen;one will be worse off or that youth will not be exploited at $3 an hour and all this sort of nonsense. There does not seem to be one substantive amendment to the bill at all, which is amazing. All they seem to be concerned about is that it is going to upset some cosy monopoly position of their supporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We have seen the trade union officials who have come through this chamber with increas ing rapidity. Some of them have gone on to be Prime Minister. Hawke came here after leading the ACTU movement and went on to lead the Labor Party. The next ACTU leader, Crean, came into the parliament. Martin Ferguson, the ACTU leader who virtually followed Mr Crean, is now in the parliament, and we will probably have Jennie George here soon. She will probably be the member for Gellibrand after the ex-Treasurer and current member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) retires. It is time that we looked differently at the way we are doing things in this country. It seems that the genuine welfare for the worker does not come into the equation at all when the Labor Party is assessing pieces of legislation such as this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would like to address some of the concerns that have been raised about this bill. Compulsory unionism will formally go. Who could possibly object to that? Workers will have the choice to join their union or not to join their union. They will have the choice to join the union of their choice. What is wrong with that? If they want to join a union and there is not a union around that suits their particular need they can start up their own union, association, organisation or whatever they want to call it and join that. What could be fairer than that?  For the first time in this country the worker is put in the supreme position, instead of being told, `You must join this union or you do not even get a job' as in some cases. It seems the way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The days of coercion and thuggery that we have seen on building sites around this country will start to fade away if we can get this legislation through the House of Representatives and the Senate. Closed shops will go, the `conveniently belong' rules will go and all the subtle, and not so subtle, pressure tactics will be over. These will be replaced by competition amongst unions. For the first time, the people who set up the organisations to represent the unions will have to really get out there and wear out a bit of boot leather in representing their constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By doing this we are harnessing and utilising all the commendable aspects of human nature for the benefit of the worker. That will ultimately lead to the benefit of the company <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2225"> or business and, as I said, to the benefit of this nation. We have not seen much of it over the last 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I am delighted to see is the restoration in the Trade Practices Act of sections 45D and E. These sections eliminate secondary boycotts and were in legislation when we were last in power in the early 1980s. They worked extremely well for the benefit of everyone&mdash;worker and employer alike. When we have restored those sections, they will eliminate the mindless, inane and insane strikes that we have seen around this country, all aimed at financially crippling and coercing businesses into submission. They will restore natural justice to the workplace. I commend not only the Minister for Industrial Relations but also the Treasurer (Mr Costello), who has the carriage of the particular piece of legislation for the restoration of those sections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian workplace agreements are a novelty in this bill. They will transform the workplace in this country for the better. At the moment we have three levels on which wages are set. We have the award system, which also includes the overaward system, and we have certified agreements, whereby unions can come in and negotiate collectively on behalf of workers and then have those agreements registered with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Both of those levels will largely remain as is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the third level that the previous government brought in for the non-unionised work force&mdash;which now represents 60 per cent or more of many work places in Australia&mdash;is the enterprise flexibility agreements. As presently structured, they will go because they have not worked. Under the present rules, until this piece of legislation is passed, the unions have to be called in whether wanted or not by the workers on site. Then the matter has to go before the Industrial Relations Commission for ratification. Enterprise flexibility agreements, as presently structured, slow down the freeing-up of the workplace in this country. Under those conditions, no workers want them&mdash;nor do employers. They have hindered progress in this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will abolish the concept of enterprise flexibility agreements, as they presently exist, and replace them with Australian workplace agreements whereby individuals, if they so wish, and employers, if they so wish, can come together, set their own agreement and simply register that agreement&mdash;provided that it does not breach certain safety net agreements&mdash;with the employment advocate. That will start to free up the system in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, as soon as these Australian workplace agreements are signed off on, strikes will be outlawed. However, strikes may still take place during the bargaining period. With the eradication of a lot of these needless strikes, I think again the biggest beneficiaries will be the working people themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minimum standards are still in place. The safety net is still there but will be simplified so that, for the first time, the Australian people and working people can understand what it is all about. Exploitation cannot take place, although this opposition would have you believe that it can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to stay under an award you can still do so. Nobody can force you off an award if you want to stay on one. That is no big deal because nobody will go off an award anyhow unless they are offered a better deal. That is just commonsense&mdash;absolute commonsense. So with that we are not, in a sense, offering anything out of the unusual. The workers themselves will be able to see that they will not move off an award unless they genuinely are offered a better deal than they have now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The safety net standards are all there, with annual leave, parental leave, long service leave, equal pay for equal work of equal value, jury service leave and all those types of things. All these things will apply not only to full-time work but also to part-time work, casual work, piece rate work. You name it, it will all be in place. No worker, working under the same terms and conditions for the same hours, can take home less money under Australian workplace agreements than they are taking home now under an award agreement. They cannot take home less. That is our absolute, rock solid guarantee.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2226">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will take a lot of the legalism out of the system. We are setting up the Office of the Employment Advocate. It will be an independent body which will be able to give free advice to both sides under an informal type of system. You can ring it up, write to it or go to see it. It will be available to small business as well as to the employees themselves. If you think you are being diddled in any way, you can go along to it and complain, and it will check out the agreement you have signed off on. There will be quite considerable penalties if someone is trying to exploit you, and you will have recourse to the courts. I do not think you could ask for anything more reasonable than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time remaining to me, I would particularly pay tribute to the minister for the proposed changes to the unfair dismissal laws which will make them fairer to both sides. There are thousands of unfair dismissal cases lodged before the courts now. This has been the greatest disaster that the previous government ever perpetrated on the Australian people. It has caused incredible misery to so many families, small business families, virtually in every town in my electorate. It has destroyed jobs. It has hindered small business in particular from taking on extra workers. It has reduced people to a degree which I think the previous minister never realised would occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only the other day I had the tragic circumstances put to me of a family in Broken Hill. They had taken on a worker. But, because the employer eventually had to retire and could not sell the business to another person, he had to put this person off. The employer now has been taken to court for unfair dismissal. It has been so mentally traumatic for this fellow, who is in bad health, that it has almost destroyed him. His wife has informed me that he is now confined to a chair in his house, living the life of some sort of zombie. It is tragic indeed to see this occur to this family because of mental stress, worry and cost ripping away at their little nest egg that they had put aside over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is happening in case after case after case that I am seeing and being told of. That side of the House has been totally indifferent <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to that tragic type of thing. People who have been dismissed for quite proper reasons know that they can exploit these small businesses in this way. Even if you go ahead and win the case, you do not get costs&mdash;and it costs at least $30,000 to $50,000 to run one of these cases through the court. You usually sign off five, 10, 15 or $20,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some incredible cases in the past. One case I have mentioned is of a truck driver who was continually breaking the law on the roads&mdash;a negligent driver who would speed and have crashes and these sorts of things. He was finally dismissed. He then had to be restored to his former employment, and his employer was forced to pay him $20,000 in compensation. It was absolutely crazy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill strikes at the heart of the desire by all Australians for a fair as well as a productive society. If we pass this bill into law, we will return the workplace to the battleground it used to be. If we reject it, we can keep the workplace peace and carry on with the workplace reforms that have brought rewards to working Australians and which have delivered outstanding improvements in the productivity of our work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A tragic irony about the system of workplace relations proposed by this bill is that New Zealand provides the basic model for it at the same time as it provides the basic proof that, as far as productivity is concerned, it does not work. In Australia, when the coalition took office productivity was running at five per cent a year. Over the past six years, it has risen almost 18 per cent. In New Zealand, it is half that. Despite this, and given a choice, the government has opted for the low wage, low productivity, discriminatory New Zealand system over the high wage, high productivity, inclusive system operating here&mdash;a triumph of narrow, interest ridden politics over good and fair policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the idea of combining fairness with efficiency which lay behind the entire economic reform program of the previous government. When Labor brought reform to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2227"> the workplace and to the economy as a whole, it was done in a carefully managed way. It was done in a cooperative way. It was done to ensure that, since everybody was involved in it, everybody should get their fair share of the reward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason reform was conducted like this was as clear to us in 1983 as it should be to this government now. We are a productive society because we are a fair society. There is simply no other way to bring about lasting reform. It is on this central point that this measure fails. This is why it should be rejected. If it is not rejected, we have more than 300 amendments to restore the workplace justice that this bill seeks to abolish, which we shall put up at a later stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the minister's weasel words about choice and higher pay cannot hide the essential point of this bill. Do not be misled by the rhetoric the minister uses to promote it. Look at what it actually proposes. It seeks to neuter the award system which institutionalises fairness at work. It seeks to limit the rights and capacity of working people to act collectively to protect their living standards. It seeks to subvert the role of the Industrial Relations Commission as umpire and guarantor of fairness at work. It proposes an ever higher level of punishment for working people, who, as a result of all of this, have no avenue left for protest or protection but the right to withdraw their labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is there any need to spell it out? If something looks like a crow and sounds like a crow and flies like a crow, chances are it is a crow. When the laws set out to stop people acting collectively to protect themselves, to make it harder for unions to help them and to cripple the umpire as well, chances are its point is something other than `Better pay for better work' as the coalition called its pre&hyphen;election industrial relations policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accidentally or intentionally, the bill depends on a fundamental misreading of how the workplace really operates. The notion that employees can negotiate on an equal footing with employers would cause people to fall off their chairs laughing in works canteens and boardrooms everywhere. I suspect they had a good laugh about it in the cabinet room too <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when they discussed this bill. But it is no laughing matter for the people who are going to be the victims of this bill&mdash;that is, most Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CRA is a model par excellence for members opposite of the way the equal footing notion should be put to work. Let me quote from the case in the evidence before the commission last year of the CRA tradesman who was paid less than the apprentices he was instructing because they were on contract and he had chosen to stay on the award. A company official was asked if it was fair that employees should be discriminated against because they chose to remain in the union. His reply went like this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, they haven't made the paradigm shift . . . They haven't got the new age company image in their brain . . . They haven't seen the new dream.</PARA>
<PARA>How could employees sensibly negotiate such critically important issues as their wages and conditions with an official whose head was full of such ignorant and obtuse rubbish?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another model for the coalition, which they pounded us with when we were in government and when it was there in its full excess, is Tweed Valley Fruit Processors. This is the company which ruled that an employee's asking for advice from a union was such `serious and wilful misconduct' that it warranted the sack. This is the company which recently warned its work force that `employees who run to outside third parties ought to think carefully about their future involvement with this company'. This is the company whose conduct of so-called secret ballots was so unfair that the ACCI withdrew from the case involving the company before the commission. There is negotiation and choice for you. These are the companies held up by the coalition as exemplars. This is the brave new world that this bill now seeks to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be among the first to say that there are very many employers who are responsible and fair. There are very many employers who oppose this legislation. They have a living to make and investment to care for and they understand that it is hard to conscript cooperation. But in the heat of competition, standards are often reduced to their lowest common denominator. Good employers are pressured <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2228"> to follow bad ones down. There is no such thing as a level playing field at work. The idea is a nonsense and this government understands that full well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why Australians have long concluded that their interests and living standards are better protected collectively than individually. This is why our predecessors in their wisdom set up a neutral conciliation and arbitration process to help keep the workplace relationship reasonably balanced and fair. By breaking this process up, by ripping the guts out of the award system and the commission and by making workers face management on their own, the government is attacking the very basis of people's living standards. Roughly 70 per cent of all the income of the average Australian family comes from wages. No increase in family assistance supplement or decrease in tax can compare with a decent, secure wage as an absolutely vital necessity in stable family life. Attack wages, and you attack families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments which ignore this do so at their peril. Families need those wages. They do not need the bogus tax cuts that the government wandered around with at the last election during all that pork barrel activity&mdash;pork parrel activity, I might say, which is now being visited upon the states, which are now imposing burdens on families in order to pay for it. Talk about robbing Peter to pay Paul!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work is critical for human dignity and is central to the self&hyphen;image of most Australians, as it is to most human beings. Intimidation in the workplace strikes at the heart of the self&hyphen;confidence of the average Australian worker, and this bill invites intimidation. The onslaught on families by this bill is continued and is aggravated by its proposals for teenage Australians and those who have to juggle work with family responsibilities. This measure goes out of its way&mdash;goes back to the thoroughly bad practice of a generation ago&mdash;to put young Australians at a disadvantage. It proposes that employers should only pay workers for time on the job that employers themselves can define as productive. In other words, a young person can be made to work a full five&hyphen;day week but be paid for a three&hyphen;day week.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also proposes that the training discount apply not to full pay rates but to the junior rates. This way young people's pay can be cut twice: once for age and then for training. It is based on an absolute ignorance of how apprenticeships work. By years two, three and four of an apprenticeship people in apprenticeships are providing a full work week for their employers. But an employer now gets in this bill the capacity to go and say, `It is only two days,' or `It is only three days.' So an apprentice providing highly skilled work, certainly by years three and four, to their employer is being obliged to take two types of pay cut from the remuneration that they take home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will happen as a result of the government's proposal will be only too apparent to those who remember the old days. Take&hyphen;home pay will be cut for young workers. Adult workers will give way to junior workers who are cheaper to employ. Part&hyphen;time and casual jobs will give way to jobs for juniors working a full week for less than a full week's pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that no young workers will be tipped out of their jobs because of this arrangement. Even if this can be ensured, it will not apply to the 370,000 young people who will start a new job in the next 12 months, nearly half of them in their first job. What protection does the government propose for these newcomers? It says that nobody will be forced to work for the dole. In practice, this means that the minimum rate for young people will be not the award rate but the dole. So we will be hearing about 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds working a 38&hyphen;hour week for $3.05 an hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is the person who has put his name to this reactionary idea. He seems to like to be the bad cop. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is in the meantime trying to be the good cop. He is being agreeable nowadays even about Ben Chifley. He has even owned up to the strength of the economy that Labor handed over to him. `It is better than good,' he told the world banking conference in Sydney on 3 June. `It continues by world standards to enjoy very strong growth.' It would be nice of him to say it in here once or twice, but he says it to the bankers. He tells <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2229"> the truth to the bankers, but not to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in January, when there was an election on the line, it was different. It was time for his now notorious negotiable guarantees. `Look,' he said, `there's no way that we are going into the next election with anything remotely resembling a $3 wage or anything that could be remotely described as resembling that. Full stop, end of story.' So $3.05 does not actually resemble $3. That has turned out to be what Winston Churchill would call a terminological inexactitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another group marked down for special punishment by this measure is Australian women. This is both in the sense that it will worsen wage inequity and because women are predominantly those who have most of the work and family complications. Overall, adult women workers get just over 79c for every dollar that goes to their male counterparts. In award or agreed base pay rates the figure is 93.8c. In over&hyphen;award payments, on the other hand, it is 54.7c per dollar. What this says is that the more wages are removed from the arbitrated system and into the decentralised system the greater the potential for wage injustice for women. The more the commission is crippled&mdash;it is the best friend that disadvantaged Australians have in industrial relations&mdash;the more this injustice is aggravated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the measure acutely discriminates against women, because it acutely discriminates against the workers&mdash;part&hyphen;timers, casuals, temporaries, outworkers&mdash;whom the new spartan award system will no longer adequately cover. Under this bill, perhaps we ought to start calling them disposable workers or contingent workers. Roughly 42 per cent of Australian women in the work force are employed part time, compared to just under 11 per cent of men. Removing arrangements for part&hyphen;time and casual work from awards, and making them subject to negotiation with the boss, looks suspiciously like targeting women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does this jell with what the minister said in his second reading speech about this bill giving people working patterns that balance their work and family responsibilities <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more effectively? What does a woman do if she works for an employer who says, `Take it, or find a job somewhere else.'? What does that do to the family budget? In what way is this confusion better than the work and family responsibility areas of the current workplace reform program which the government wants to abolish?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compare this prejudiced, confusing and ultimately counterproductive scheme with what was happening in the system that this bill seeks to replace. Under Labor, workplace relations took its place in a sensibly managed economic reform strategy. More than 300 unions have been reduced to just over 50, with about 95 per cent of employees represented by 18 main unions. The old complex award classification system has been clarified and simplified. Best practice was being promoted through a workplace reform program. It emphasised the need to bring along workers who experience particular disadvantages, such as women and people with language difficulties. It set up more interesting, more adaptable and less hierarchical work arrangements. It aimed to make the workplace more productive, but also safer and healthier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Enterprise bargaining, the most recent step in the reform process, was growing, according to the latest reports from DIR, despite its novelty in Australian conditions and despite its potential for dispute. The whole thing was done in an atmosphere of cooperativeness between employers, unions and government. We did not abuse reform to fight old battles, as this bill wants to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of strikes was down to a tenth of what it was 15 years ago, even though the work force has grown 25 per cent and has undergone enormous and unsettling change. Productivity has increased by almost 18 per cent since 1990 when enterprise bargaining took hold. Wage moderation has helped bring inflation down to historically low levels. We had four per cent annual growth for 4&half; years straight. We created 160,000 jobs a year&mdash;more than two million in our 13 years in office. In our last three years alone, we created more than 700,000 jobs, 70 per cent of them in small business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2230">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks to all this, we gathered the wherewithal to invest in families, health and education. At the end of it all, compared to where we were when Labor first came into office, in international competitiveness terms, the situation in Australia has improved by 40 per cent in that period of time. We created an export culture in manufacturing and service industries. We created an export culture in the work force, and we delivered fairness at exactly the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does this government propose to reward workers for this cooperation? It is by pushing them out into the kind of low wage, low productivity industrial wasteland we see in the United States and New Zealand where jobs can be bought at bargain basement rates. What sort of vision is that? The Prime Minister says he does not want us to go down the American road. We say, `Hear, hear!' But he takes us straight down the American road on industrial relations legislation, straight down the American road on wages justice, and that produces social dislocation more than anything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, guns are a symptom of that process. They are so serious, of course, that they become causal. However, the social concerns in the United States are a product of these levels of injustice and there is nobody in authority in the United States who, while they might argue around the edges, will tell you otherwise. It is not a vision, of course. It is not meant to be. It is protection against the challenge to the management prerogative which comes from working people acting collectively. It is punishment for working people who have had the temerity to involve themselves in high level policy. It is designed to put working people back in their place. It is Reith's revenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 31 May, Bob Hawke addressed a conference in Sydney about employment contracts. The Prime Minister, deliberately misinterpreting what Mr Hawke had said, called this address `sensible and constructive'. I agree. Mr Hawke&mdash;and remember, this is a man who has forgotten more about industrial relations than the minister will ever learn&mdash;said: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe that the Australian people have endorsed or will endorse anything which can lead <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to discrimination against working men and women who freely choose to exercise the right to belong to trade unions and bargain collectively through their union.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . my very real fear is that there are those in the government ranks and certainly in industry who are motivated by a mindless anti&hyphen;union sentiment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  The Australian experience and ethos recognises the need and the right, particularly of the weak, to organise and be represented collectively. The trade union movement is justified in arguing to maintain that right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An Australia which allowed itself to degenerate into a selfish individualism would be an infinitely less congenial and, ultimately, more conflict&hyphen;ridden society than we would wish or to which we have become accustomed.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, that was said by a man who knows a darn sight more about industrial relations than any other person, I would suggest, in this House, and certainly more than any member on the governing side. He brought to it his record of massive success during our period of government in producing the productivity figures, the growth in export figures, and the change in our international competitiveness that I was talking about. I was delighted to hear the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) speaking on these matters a bit earlier on, because he carries a considerable record as far as these things are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister&mdash;as any fair person would&mdash;found the comments of the former Prime Minister sensible and constructive. So do we. That being the case, we have the prospect of agreement on what is probably the most important element in the everyday lives of Australians. The Prime Minister should withdraw and rebuild this farce of a bill along lines that we all agree are sensible and constructive. If he can do this, he will get our support. But first let him take this bill away and start again.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say I am honoured to be following the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in this place in the debate on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. However, throughout the course of his address I was puzzled as to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2231"> whether or not he was actually addressing this particular bill. I note it was Goebbels who started the idea of perpetuating folklore&mdash;if you say something often enough, eventually it may become fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the Leader of the Opposition's pep talk to his troops which we have just heard, he talked a lot about vested interests. I am on my feet today because, until this bill was introduced, industrial relations in this country had been all about ensuring vested interests in the industrial relations process were well looked after. Those vested interests were the generally out of touch bosses of, in  particular, the large unions, as well as the people involved in the previous government and, I also submit for that matter, a lot of people who represent the bigger businesses in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never been part of the industrial relations club. I have always considered industrial relations to be a complex issue. I have just been a victim of the poor outcomes which have obtained over the last 13 years. One thing is for sure, Labor's approach in government was to ensure there was potential conflict between employer and employee, and the starting point was that industrial relations was always going to be an adversarial process. Union bosses, as a result, etched out a role in the process by creating and then resolving disputes. This bill before us today is all about bringing an end to this dreadful cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to make an end now to the vested interests of people like the heads of so many unions who are out of touch. They arrogantly presume that workers, whom they claim to represent, are incapable of protecting their own interests or even understanding them. Labor fulfilled this particular approach by making the system as complex as possible. The system and its participants ensured their own survival instead of ensuring sensible and straightforward outcomes. They did this by entrenching  compulsory  involvement  of unions and industrial tribunals in every aspect of workers' everyday lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unions, of course, created fear and loathing to try to scare the workers and we have seen this again here today from the Leader of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Opposition. They relied on workers not questioning the process and dutifully accepting the outcomes as the very best possible. They basically kept workers in this country downtrodden and reliant on the outcomes determined by the industrial relations club.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most workers cannot and do not understand the various processes. The processes are awfully complex and, as I said, this certainly suits the club and its exclusive group of participants. I will admit it certainly did include the very big business operators in this country. They do well whoever is in power. Let us face it, under Labor the concept of big business, big government and big unions really took off. Small business in this country, the group of Australians who promised the most as far as solving unemployment problems are concerned, suffered the consequences directly. Cost structures, wages and conditions, are all geared to the very biggest of operators in this country and small business operators had to cope alone, try to survive and if they did not then they fell over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The average workers certainly do know one thing about what Labor produced under their regime, and this is, they are far from content with the outcomes. Their wages declined due to the accord, the incentive to work harder for more pay declined, productivity became synonymous with job losses and the number of jobs declined. Workers' freedom of choice and their long sought after freedom to choose was also destroyed. The accord kept the big unions, big business and Labor's big government very happy but it failed the average Australian worker and the average Australian small business owner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central platform of the accord was cutting workers' wages. This is what it was all about. Increasing the cost factors for small business operators went hand in hand with this. Our plans will ensure employees' real wages are going to be enhanced. By stark contrast with Labor's anti&hyphen;individual, collective, compulsory approach, we will balance the promotion of flexibility with the provision of statutory protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our election policy, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better pay for better work</EMPHASIS>, outlined our plans and is the basis of this bill. We promised, and we are in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2232"> process of delivering, structural reform of the labour market. The imperative of being competitive with the world as well as the rightful expectation of average Australian workers and their families who seek to enjoy improved living standards through higher employment and better paid jobs over time is our motivation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will ensure fair dealing for all Australians, bosses and workers, at the enterprise level. We will put the negotiations and agreements back into the arena where most people can understand them so the out of touch union officials cannot automatically intrude on relationships of mutual trust between workers and their bosses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will ensure there is always fair agreement making. Our system will be underpinned by a set of agreed minimum conditions so workers can always negotiate more pay and better conditions based on their capacity to provide better performance to their employer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I appreciate what you say. I am sure those opposite would like to hear the words I am offering today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our bill will give workers the chance to get ahead, something which Labor denied them as a result of the accord. We will also ensure fair competition by removing the monopoly rights and compulsory membership of industrial organisations. We will give workers more freedom of choice and entrench their freedom to actually choose. We will also ensure there are fair compliance arrangements and ensure the trust underpinning an arrangement cannot be broken. People must be held to commitments entered into by agreement. Primary responsibility for workplace relations and agreement making will return to employers and employees at the enterprise level, the workplace level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the award system will be to provide and maintain a safety net of minimum <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wages and conditions but the key thing is ensuring freedom of association. Employers and workers respectively will be free to join or not to join democratic and accountable employer organisations and trade unions. This act emphasises the social importance of avoiding any discrimination between non&hyphen;union and union workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation emphasises the direct workplace relationships. Labor tried to ignore the mutual interest of employer and employee in the success and the prosperity of business. They had an adversarial approach. But we want to restore the faith which can and does exist in so many enterprises around this country between the boss and the worker. This can best be achieved without complexity or unwanted third party intervention of organisations, especially the super&hyphen;unions. Employers and employees will be empowered to make decisions about their own relationship at work. This is freedom. Agreements can be reached on over&hyphen;award wages and conditions because of the closeness of small business workplaces. This will ensure all participants understand and appreciate each other's interests. They certainly do this better than the third party union protagonists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People were saying to me during the election campaign, `What has Martin Ferguson driving around in a 7 series BMW in Melbourne got to do with me on the shop floor here in Salisbury?' This is a very important point. It is a very telling point. While the leaders of the super&hyphen;unions are having a high time at the expense of the average worker, the average punter is copping it in the neck. They are certainly not getting the return they should be for the work they put in.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CK6">Mr HARDGRAVE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some opposite will find this surprising because they have lived in a cloistered environment, but even compulsory superannuation was seen by a lot of average workers as wages forgone. Forget about the national savings strategy for a moment and just consider this. The bosses were paying the extra money into the accumulated income of the average worker but the worker was not realising the return on a weekly basis. People were finding it hard to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2233"> pay bills. A lot of these arrangements were put in place because it seemed like a good thing to do at the super&hyphen;union level. Union bosses have certainly had a very good time at the expense of the average worker. Those opposite know it. In fact, I would suggest, to paraphrase a bit of Shakespeare, `Methinks they protest their innocence a bit too much.' The average worker was at the trial on 2 March and they passed their verdict on you people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn for a moment to the unfair dismissal laws. Labor's unfair dismissal laws in fact cut at the heart of the efforts made by so many local small business operators in my electorate to struggle out of the recession which you people said we had to have. It was an interventionist regulation which depressed many small businesses and wrecked more than a few in my area. It kicked at the confidence of small business operators in my electorate and as a result investment declined. At a time of high unemployment, especially among the young, small business just would not hire anybody. They said they were worried they were going to hire a mistake and, if they did, how could they get rid of them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without canvassing any comment from anyone, through the course of the election campaign I had about 150 small business operators come to me and say, `Good staff are hard to find. You don't sack good staff.' They were worried about hiring bad staff and Labor had restricted the process of their exercising the reasonable managerial prerogative of dismissing such staff. Employers in my area were creating new and exotic ways to get around the Industrial Relations Commission, and the cost factor was high. The bottom line is this: Labor's unfair dismissal law cost people jobs in my area. There must be thousands of potential jobs in the electorate of Moreton alone which were never started because employers were scared they would not be able to dismiss anyone who did not work out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's failed arrangements are on their way out the door, and this is good news. Our new unfair dismissal system will provide employees with access to a fair and simple process of appeal against dismissal but will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> also ensure their employers are treated fairly too. This is, as the minister rightly describes it in this bill, a fair go all round. It is a new approach which will send signals to small business that it is time to get back into business, and this is the signal they want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reality, the industrial relations club approach which we have suffered over the last 13 or so years did not suit most people in this country. This legislation will take the power away from the IR club, away from the big unions, big business and big government and put it squarely in the hands of the workers and their direct employers. It is striking a blow for individualism ahead of collectivism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn for a moment to the award system. The government is keeping faith with the tens of thousands of new voters who supported us on 2 March. We have maintained our commitment to ensure all employers and employees with federal award coverage will have the choice of remaining on their awards. Simplification will ensure consistency between the role of the Industrial Relations Commission, the scope of awards and any arrangements for any adjustment. This bill will reinforce the role of awards as a genuine safety net for Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We view the viability of the wage system&mdash;its capacity to provide a safety net protection and to encourage agreement making&mdash;as being as important as meeting overall economic objectives. The Industrial Relations Commission will focus on the setting and maintaining of minimum standards for agreements. While not generally arbitrating on claims above the minimum safety net, the Commission will continue to conciliate on all matters, including agreements, if requested by the parties involved. This seems fair to me. Reforms to awards will deliver critical changes which, while acknowledged by the previous government as necessary, were never actually put into place because their ACTU bosses were pulling the strings and said no. The Industrial Relations Commission under this legislation will be charged with the important task of reviewing awards to ensure more flexibility on provisions to better meet the needs of people in individual enterprises and workplaces. Restrictions on regular part&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2234">time work will be removed. This is going to help a lot of people, particularly women, who are seeking part&hyphen;time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simplified awards will deliver more choice in the workplace. Employers and employees will talk to each other about the best ways to organise their workplace to their mutual benefit. The jobs of thousands of young people will be protected as junior rates of pay will be retained. Labor wanted to abolish them. This whole bill is all about freedom of choice and empowering workers with the right to choose. This will be facilitated by making the rules more user-friendly and keeping the focus at the local enterprise level. Employers and employees will have a wide range of choices and this is what they told me they wanted when I knocked on all those doors through the electorate of Moreton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Federal provisions will allow informal over&hyphen;award arrangements or formalised agreements in the form of Australian workplace agreements, the AWAs. Formalised collective agreements can be struck too. The certified agreements, CAs, can be made with unions or directly between employers and employees. State based agreements can be reached by consent between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not discriminate in favour of one form of agreement over another. We are going to leave the choice in the hands of the parties involved, collective or individual; union, or not union. Whatever way is chosen, all agreements are designed to place the primary responsibility for industrial relations with employers and employees at the workplace level, according to what they want, not what some out&hyphen;of&hyphen;touch super&hyphen;union boss in Melbourne might decree, subject to statutory minimum standards to maintain some protection for the workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout my address, quite contrary to the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition who tried to peddle the same folklore which Labor is desperately trying to keep alive, this bill will strike a blow for individual freedom. The government's industrial relations approach is underpinned by the freedom of association principle. You see, unlike Labor, we actually trust the people, the average workers, to make the best choice for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> themselves. We support their right to be, or not to be, in a union or an employer organisation. The bill also demonstrates our resolve that all Australians should be treated equally under the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will allow employees to make their own choice about what type of union membership suits them within guidelines which complies with some basic eligibility rules. Some workers may decide to set up an enterprise union of their very own and if workers turn away from the super&hyphen;unions which cover them today because they believe they are out of touch&mdash;they are too distant from the average membership grassroots&mdash;then I certainly would support workers who want to do this or perhaps to vote for disamalgamation. This bill will allow such freedom and this is why those opposite are so frightened. So many of them realise their rhetoric of the past has all been about supporting the structures which have failed so many average Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simply, this government is not anti&hyphen;union; we are pro&hyphen;worker and we are not attacking unions. The bill will help those unions which are in touch with their workers. The other out&hyphen;of&hyphen;touch unions and those who care to represent them in this place may suffer as workers continue to vote with their feet, as all of the statistics show they have over the last 10 or 15 years, and leave unions which do not service them the way they need. Unions which seek to be effective and provide good service to their members will certainly flourish under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is delivering on the commitment we made to Australian workers. We are going to give them back the power which has been taken from them by the accord and by 13 years of Labor Party government. These new arrangements will deliver more jobs, better working conditions and better pay for Australians. Australians will be given the chance to be more productive and to gain greater rewards for their individual efforts and also to generate better returns for the investors who finance their companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about companies which are set up by mums and dads, by individuals, by people who want to have a go. We are talking <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2235"> about small business operators. This is the main reason for my contribution today. It is very important those opposite do not lose sight of this fact. We are not talking about the CRAs and the BHPs. We are talking about mum and dad businesses, the small businesses of this country, the businesses in which most of the jobs are going to be generated as a result of the changes we are talking about today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members on this side of the chamber have been listening to individual Australians&mdash;workers and employers alike. We know workers, in particular, are fed up with being told they cannot negotiate directly with their bosses without being told what to do and how to do it by their union bosses. I would certainly not be a party to any process which undermined a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. I am all about freedom of choice and also the freedom to choose. I believe this bill will deliver a fair go on many different fronts involving industrial relations in this country&mdash;to workers and to small business operators in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only losers will be the union bosses, or at least those who have not been listening. There certainly are a lot of good union bosses in this country who have been fighting their own fights against the super&hyphen;union creep and against the amalgamation process which the previous government tried to entrench. We certainly want to make sure those union bosses who have been having a good time at the expense of the average worker get their act together. This bill will certainly provide the power and the tools which are necessary for the average worker to ensure this occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt this bill will be passed in this place, but what we are waiting to see is whether or not the Senate wishes to perpetuate the pathetic anti&hyphen;worker processes which exist now, or whether it will allow the introduction of this new deal which we are offering to average Australians to enable them to rise out of the mire.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the Labor opposition could never be accused of being anachronistic. I recognise that the government members have been trying to portray our opposition to this bill as a sign that we hanker for the old days of the Internationale or for when Bob Hawke was the leader of the ACTU.

These new ideas of the government concerning workplace relations will not be accepted by the opposition simply for the fact that, because of their newly fashioned status, they must somehow be better than what they seek to replace or more beneficial to the workers of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New does not mean better. In the case of this legislation, new actually means worse; new actually means that young people, women, migrant workers and workers from vulnerable sections of our community will be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2236"> pushed to the wall and told to put up or shut up; new means all Australian workers are now susceptible to having their rights in the workplace savaged by deceitful employers; new, in the case of this legislation, means exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think of myself as being a fairly parochial member. I can appreciate the so&hyphen;called big picture issues, and I can understand the fascination they hold for a lot of members of this House. But I have also been more interested in and concerned about those issues which are of immediate importance to my constituents: I am talking about health, welfare, education and jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with my parochial member's hat on now that I stand before this House today. Looking at my electorate, I see that the government's workplace relations bill will have an immediate, and in some cases a very devastating, effect on sections of my own community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell the House and, in case he may be listening, sulking away somewhere in his office, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) a little bit about my electorate of Prospect. Prospect is one of the most multicultural electorates in Australia. Nearly 50 per cent of people in my electorate were born in a country other than Australia. Over 113 different languages are spoken. In my seat they speak Swahili to Swedish. It is a young electorate: only approximately 6,000 of my constituents are over the age of 70. Young families are pouring into areas such as Bossley Park each month to begin new lives and raise their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In more established areas, such as Fairfield, the numbers of young teenagers readying themselves to leave school and to either continue their studies or find employment grows every year. They are young, and they are ethnically diverse; that is what Prospect is about. Along with women, it is the young and the migrants in my electorate, and indeed throughout Australia, who stand now to lose from this government's new workplace legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation will affect them because, as my colleague the shadow minister for industrial relations (Mr McMullan) has said prior <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to this debate, `It is based on the fundamentally flawed assumption that workplace relations and contracts of employment are just like any other contracts and that the parties that come to it have equal negotiating power.' The Minister for Industrial Relations shrugged his shoulders when it was said to him. He then turned around and said smugly, `What, don't you think Australian workers are mature enough to bargain with their employers? Don't you want them thinking for themselves?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the minister's way of making some pathetic innuendo that the only reason we on this side of the House object to his unfair legislation is because we are involved in some sort of skulduggery with the ACTU. We do not oppose the rights of individuals to bargain with their employers. We do not oppose individual freedom or the rights of workers to chose their own path in their careers. We do oppose their exploitation by unscrupulous employers, however few we know there to be in Australia. Of course, we oppose exploitation when it comes as a result of the plans and the orchestrations of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party appreciates that for the young, women and migrant workers this legislation holds the greatest threat. Not for a moment do we presume that the people for whom we speak lack the maturity to make choices or that they cannot think for themselves. What we see are people without high standards of education, people with poor English skills, and people with a desperate need to keep their jobs in order to put food on the table, to clothe their kids and to provide a roof over their families' heads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see is how this legislation will affect these people. We can see the inequalities that lie between many of these people and their employers in their working relationship. We see the disparity, and as such we understand the fatal flaw of this legislation before the House. We can appreciate what it will do to the workers of Australia, and what saddens and sickens me is that I fear so too can both the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Prime Minister himself (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take a look at the young people of Australia. Let us take a glimpse at what the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2237"> workplace relations bill means for them. Firstly, let us attend to the recent comments made by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). In a recent speech to ACOSS, Dr Kemp signalled to the audience that the government considers very favourably the idea of having young people work for a weekly take&hyphen;home wage of a size equivalent to the dole. What did he say exactly, in case you think I am misquoting him? His exact words were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new trainee or apprentice rate will be determined, taking into account the amount of time spent in productive work and in training, whether on or off the job. No young person will be required to take up such a training option where their total income would be less than under the income support arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>But I am sure the good doctor wouldn't say no to training incomes being fixed at a level equal to income support arrangements&mdash;or, in layman's terms, the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the government's legislation allows employers to decide for themselves just how much time a young person in his or her employ spends on productive work or on&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training. Sounds reasonable? Think again. With these factors combined, this means that a young person can attend work each day, pack their lunch, spend an hour on the bus getting there, but only receive pay for one, two or three days. With Dr Kemp making sounds extremely familiar to those days of Jobsback in October 1992, it is not hard to see where the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) is heading with his legislation before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what does this mean to the average weekly wage of that young person? I would have thought it was pretty self&hyphen;explanatory, but, for the benefit of those on the other side of the House who choose to support their minister in the tabling of this iniquitous bill, I will explain. Say you are a 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old apprentice from my electorate in Fairfield working a 38&hyphen;hour week, including two days a week training. If you take Dr Kemp's lead and figure that an employer has set for this young man or women a wage equivalent to the dole, which for most 16&hyphen; to 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds is set at $232.10 per fortnight, that would translate to this young person working for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $3.05 per hour. They cannot deny it: it is there. Say that young person is a little older, perhaps 19 or 20, and he or she is a trainee living in a true middle&hyphen;class Australian suburb, like Greystanes in my electorate. Under the plan formulated by the member for Flinders and the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), they would be paid $3.38 per hour for a 38&hyphen;hour week, calculated on the average unemployment payment for a person of that age being $256.70 per fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These figures seem to me to resemble youth wages. The last time I remember hearing about so&hyphen;called youth wages, and I am sure honourable members would recollect that, was during the Fightback campaign. Let us go back in time again to the year of 1992, when the coalition's youth wage policy offered 15&hyphen; to 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds $3 per hour. Under the present government, people of this age group under this bill should be glad the coalition values them slightly higher; in fact, five cents an hour higher. In 1992 the coalition planned to have 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds working for $3.50 an hour, thanks to their Jobsback policy. Now they seek through this bill to have people in this age group actually working for 12c an hour less than what they proposed four years ago. Their generosity knows no limits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the second time in two days that I have had to throw my mind back to the Fightback days. Believe me, it is not something I enjoy. It is indicative of the fact that a large proportion of the government's legislation now coming before the House was actually coalition policy in the 1992 Fightback policy&mdash;a policy that the Australian people then abhorred and rejected. What they have now done is tarted it up, they have given it a new coat of paint and it is being instigated by stealth. These young people need a job&mdash;we do not argue with that. We do not argue that youth unemployment is too high, and you will not get any argument or objection to any sensible steps being taken to correct that. But is exploiting the young people of Australia, exploiting their desire to obtain work and their hopes for the future, the way to go? Of course it's not. And that is what this legislation aims to bring about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us now turn to women and what goodies we have got in store in this bill for them. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2238"> We will take a look at what the Minister for Industrial Relations has devised in relation to women's award rates of pay. Firstly, he has abolished the Industrial Relations Commission's ability to hear equal pay cases. This then forces wages to be set by direct negotiation rather than by the commission itself. As it stands today, Australian women enjoy an equality of pay with men equalled hardly anywhere else in the world. In fact, only Sweden comes close. Statistics show that on average women on awards receive 93.8 per cent of men's wages, and this is due to our country's practice of pursuing a centralised wage fixing system. This system protects women, believe it or not, from receiving a lower rate of pay than men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will happen outside that system when women are forced to negotiate one&hyphen;on&hyphen;one with their employers? Let us take a look at over&hyphen;award payments, payments that have been set by employers, by themselves, independent of awards. We find that women receive only 54.7 per cent of average over&hyphen;award payments. The message is clear, by negotiating directly with employers, women lose out. Traditionally, employers negotiate higher wage levels for men than for women. To quote Adele Horin in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, employers, who are nearly always men themselves, `put a financial premium on jobs done by men'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the millions of women who are working part&hyphen;time across Australia? There are thousands of these women in my electorate alone, most of them bringing in that little bit extra to help with their family budget. There are many others who balance their household expenditure with the little money that they receive through work plus whatever support they can receive from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the minister's new scheme the Industrial Relations Commission has no power to create an award which sets maximum or minimum hours of work for part&hyphen;time employees. This becomes a matter left solely to the discretion of the employer. I can just see it now. Take a woman from part of my electorate, from Villawood. She relies on her 20 hours a week as a cleaner to keep her family together. One Monday she finishes a shift and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> her employer stops her on her way out and she is told, `You can go home. We don't need you for the rest of this week. Come in again next Monday'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is she to do? She needs this job. Does she negotiate with her employer? Does she haggle? I ask members present and those constituents sitting in the gallery whether this woman looks like she is in an equal negotiating position with her employer? Of course she is not. Nine times out of 10 she will accept his direction and come back on Monday. She needs this job whether it is for 20 hours or six hours, and by objecting to that she would lose it completely. And what recourse does this woman have other than going to the Salvation Army or to the Smith Family for help? She has none. The commission is powerless to help her and put an end to such workplace abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about migrants? I can just picture it. A migrant is called from the factory floor into the office of his employer to negotiate a wage. This person has few English skills. This person failed to finish his education in his country of origin. This person toils eight hours a day in the factory to keep himself off welfare. When this person was hired it was a condition of employment that he was not a member of a union. He now stands alone in his employer's office and is expected to negotiate his pay, or should I say have his pay dictated to him. Do government members seriously think that this person is in a position to sit down and negotiate a fair and equitable wage for himself? It will not happen, it cannot happen, and he will leave his employer's office on a much lower rate of pay for the job he was doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For migrant workers this legislation will not bring the brand new day imagined by the member for Flinders. It will not give to them the better work for better pay promised by him in his second reading speech. On the other hand, if this legislation is passed in its current form we will see the creation of ghettos of lowly paid migrant workers. They will have no protection, no&hyphen;one to help them receive the equality of pay that they should expect. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2239">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I return to John Ducker's speech at the Labor Council. While discussing the Labor movement in Australia he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor . . . has not shied away from challenge, and has continually exhibited its capacity to recognise change and act to accommodate it.</PARA>
<PARA>He is right. Labor still recognises change, good and bad, and we are still not shying away from any challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation presented to the House by the government is a challenge. It is a challenge to every single Australian and to the rights which protect them in the workplace. It is a challenge to those who are the most vulnerable members of our society and to their ability to put food on the table and a roof over their heads. It is a challenge to equity and fairness which we have all taken for granted in this country and which now stands, through this bill before the House, under attack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, blinded by ideology and by its economic rationalism, blinded by its naked desire to stamp its authority on Australian society after 13 years in the wilderness, now stands prepared to ruin the lives of the people it has sworn to protect&mdash;the people of Australia. Australians should consider themselves warned. This will not be the end of these actions. This is not the industrial relations package either the Prime Minister or the Minister for Industrial Relations actually wanted to put before the House; they wanted to go further. We know the Prime Minister and we know where he is coming from. His problem is that he painted himself into the tightest of corners before the election and this legislation is, at this stage, as far as he thinks the Australian people will allow him to go&mdash;this time, that is. He and his ministers will return, they are going to do a General Macarthur on us whether we like it or not and when they do it will hurt like hell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia, with the legislation we have before the House, should stand warned on what it will mean. We do not need to have debates and listen to the government say that this would not have needed to be unless Labor, when in government, had taken other action. We say this is certainly not needed for the people of Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are going to do with this bill is divide communities. What you are going to do with this bill before the House is give to some and take from most. What you are going to do with this bill is to make sure that there is no protection and that the basic principles that we as Australians have always believed in and lived by&mdash;and that is a fair go for all&mdash;will be ignored in this legislation, will be ignored in the workplace and will be ignored when you want to take on the so&hyphen;called one-to-one bargaining with the employers. I am not for a minute saying that all employers will adopt this type of attitude. I have been for 27 years an employer myself in business. But that is not the point. What we are saying is you have here a piece of legislation which can be used by the unscrupulous within our community to take away from those who are least able to defend themselves and who are least able to negotiate for themselves&mdash;all that they have to offer to their families and to the growth of this country is the blood, sweat and tears that come from their toil. If the government is proud of bringing bills like this before the House, all other Australians need to hang their heads in shame. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill introduced by my friend and colleague the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) is one of the most significant pieces of legislation to be introduced in this House. It is significant because of both the ideas it incorporates and the positive impacts these long overdue reforms will have on our economy and employment prospects. The ideas that the bill incorporates are the ideas that are driving successful and forward thinking businesses and economies throughout the world. They are ideas about workplace cooperation; shared goals and meaning; employee empowerment and participation in decision making; enterprise responsiveness and competitiveness; innovation; rewarding performance and direct workplace relationships. These are notions that people seek to embrace and pursue every day in the workplace, impeded at times only by an industrial relations structure that is at odds with the ideas of modern economies and creative contemporary enterprises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2240">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The positive benefits from the bill include deliverance of Australian workplaces from a system that has discouraged employees, employers, our economic prospects and the community more generally. I listened with interest to what the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) was saying about looking backwards, throwbacks and these sorts of things. This is about looking forward and about what sort of industrial system is in the best interests of our nation into the future. To use one of those modern management concepts that I alluded to earlier, many Australian businesses are saying this is just in time. They are very grateful and certainly embrace the ideas we have put forward. A cooperative workplace culture and a genuine flexible labour market means higher productivity and competitiveness for Australian enterprises, improved employment prospects and better pay and living standards for Australian workers. The flexibility and choices embodied in the bill provide enterprise and workplace responsibility for industrial relations and agreement making. At last the opportunity will exist for employers and employees to get together and embrace a comprehensive approach to human resource management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reforms are about delivering jobs that are exciting yet stable in businesses that embrace innovation and recognise that their employees are their most valuable resource. The bill provides for a strengthening of the workplace partnership between employees and employers, supported by a substantial reduction in the opportunity for uninvited third&hyphen;party intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond providing for industrial relations agreement making at the workplace level, the bill seeks to redefine the award system as a safety net of minimum wages and conditions, to ensure freedom of association, to avoid discrimination and to assist employees to balance their work and family responsibilities. The bill covers at least five important areas: freedom of association, simplification of awards, Labor's unfair unfair dismissal laws, new ways to reach workplace agreements, and secondary boycotts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In factories and offices, employees and employers in Australia&mdash;and in my electorate, Dunkley&mdash;must have good relationships if <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they are to increase the number of jobs available and the amount of reward that employees and employers receive for working together more productively. Our side of the House understands that better pay for better work is an admirable goal for employees, but it is also okay to make a profit. If no profit is being made, the opportunity for employees to earn higher wages from higher productivity is denied outright. So we are quite happy about the idea of the rewards being spread between the employees and the employers in a more productive workplace.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill will allow Australian employees and employers to reach their full potential in a spirit of cooperation. It is formal recognition that times have changed, notwithstanding some of the ranting that is going on on the other side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industrial relations structures and systems that we have been working under were devised in a time that has passed. Industrial relations is about people, not the preservation of structures. Much of the rest of the world recognised this before we did, but&mdash;a bit like the delayed introduction of colour TV to Australia&mdash;the delay will mean that we have the best possible industrial relations system, because we can draw from the experience of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workplace relations bill is a complementary industrial framework for those who know that the wellbeing of employees and employers is inherently linked to the success of the enterprise. Having businesses go down&mdash;as far too many businesses in Dunkley did, under the former government&mdash;is of no benefit to anybody. There is no opportunity for employment when a business goes belly&hyphen;up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Informed negotiation and sensible compromise characterise this understanding of the inherent link between the success of the business and the wellbeing of both employees and employers. This government understands that this type of relationship needs to be underpinned by a safety net because human <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2241"> relationships can at times be dysfunctional or simply not activated or nourished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that there are good and less good employees and employers around this place. That is why the bill provides for an award system that is an effective safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions, to be maintained by the Industrial Relations Commission. The `them and us' culture that is being promoted by the other side, to whip up a fear campaign, should be recognised as nothing more than Labor's miserable attempt to rebuild its membership. Real people know that job opportunities are being forgone because of the active discouragement the current industrial relations system presents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to talk about one such injustice. On a very happy day for many people in Australia and many people in the Dunkley electorate, when the locks on the offices of the federal member for Dunkley were being changed by the local locksmith, the locksmith said to me, `I'm just about to put someone on but I'm not quite sure. What is it that your government is offering to try to encourage small businesses to employ more people?' I explained to him the sorts of reforms that we took to the election and are now seeking to implement. The locksmith said, `That sounds about right. I think I might go just that little bit toward employing somebody and actually give a young person in our community a job.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit rich when I hear people from the other side talking about injustice in these reforms. The biggest injustice in not pursuing the reforms introduced by the industrial relations minister would be denying that young person in Dunkley the opportunity of gaining a job at all because of the ridiculous impediments the current system provides. We are also giving employees a choice as to whether they stay in an award or, as some opt to do at present, sign an agreement that must contain minimum conditions.</PARA>

That is why the New South Wales opposition leader and others have been prompted, quite legitimately, to suggest that one of the other reasons why these taxes and charges have been imposed is to hide the fact that, so far from the New South Wales budget being in surplus of $5 million, it is in an underlying deficit of about $420 million.</PARA>

The truth of the matter was that Mr Egan was desperate to cover up his budget problem in any event. The major revenue measure which was announced by New South Wales involves broadening the payroll tax base to cover employers' superannuation contributions. This particular change is one that has already been implemented in South Australia and no doubt has been under consideration in New South Wales for quite some time. The second component of the New South Wales tax change&mdash;an increase in stamp duty on motor vehicle transactions&mdash;is something designed to bring it into line with Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory: measures which would have been under consideration for quite some considerable time.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make it clear that the government has long championed the cause of retirement savings accounts and that government policy is to allow retirement savings accounts to be introduced by banks and other financial institutions. The government is working on measures which will be introduced to allow that to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was rather surprised to read in the newspaper this morning some comment in relation to those retirement savings accounts, and I want to make the situation entirely clear. Under the new industrial relations framework which this government is bringing into the parliament, clauses relating to superannuation would not be included in federal awards. This would reduce complexity. There would no longer be different requirements under awards in the superannuation guarantee legislation. But employees would be able to negotiate the choice of fund as part of Australian workplace agreements. They would be able to have a choice which is currently denied to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons why the coalition has always supported retirement savings accounts is choice. People will have the opportunity to choose where they put their retirement savings money. Year after year the Labor government rejected the opportunity for choice and for people to open up retirement savings accounts. You were not interested in giving employees choice. You were interested in making sure that the money was controlled by the friends which controlled your government&mdash;the ACTU. This is a government which will give people choice. It is not beholden in the way that the Labor Party was to those privileged and special interests.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retirement savings accounts will benefit particularly those who move from job to job. They can accumulate their savings in one account. Retirement savings accounts have particular benefits for women, who tend to move in and out of the work force whilst they have child responsibilities. A retirement savings account would enable them, regardless of breaks in work patterns or moving from job to job, to accumulate savings in a portable account to look after their own retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to introducing retirement savings accounts and making it possible for them to be regulated by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, as they would be viewed as a superannuation product. They will be subject to the same preservation rules and attract the taxation benefits offered to superannuation funds. The government believes that this is an important development to boost savings, to give choice and to give the opportunity for better financial outcomes for those who deserve it.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As members on both sides of the House will know, there was no constituency in Australia to which the policies of the coalition in the campaign were more directly pitched than the small business community. We did that for two reasons: firstly, because we believe in the inherent contribution that small business has made and will continue to make to the economic strength of Australia; and, secondly, because we believe very strongly that it is only through a powerful and growing small business sector that a permanent solution to the unemployment problem, particularly amongst the young, will be achieved.

In the personal letter which you sent to the residents of Box Hill before the last election, do you recall promising that `the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which subsidises the cost of many vital drugs, will be retained'? Has your parliamentary secretary, Senator Bob Woods, stated, `It's not a matter of whether the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is transferred to the States, it's a matter of when it's transferred to the States'?  Does the minister agree with his parliamentary secretary, and why won't this, to quote the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, `result in eight different approval systems, eight different pricing systems and unequal access to needed medicines across Australia'?  Finally, if on 20 August, when the budget is brought down, you break the personal commitments that you gave to the residents of Box Hill not to cut Medicare rebates and to retain the national pharmaceutical benefits scheme, will you resign?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a question of you, Mr Speaker, and it relates to supplementary questions. I think it is fair enough to say that on this side of the House, if not on the other, your moves to take, at your discretion, supplementary questions is most welcome. However, in making the decision whether or not you will take a supplementary question, it appears that you are assessing the answer of the minister without having the benefit of any knowledge of the nature of the supplementary question. Rather than having to mark each answer as to whether or not it is suitable or appropriate to ask a supplementary question, might it not be a better approach to allow the supplementary question to be asked and then decide whether you will exercise your discretion?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of indulgence rather than as a question to you, Mr Speaker, I put it to you that we do need to have some further consideration of this matter of supplementary questions. I took you to say, in response to the proposal for a supplementary question from the member for Banks, that it was an important question and on that basis the supplementary question should be allowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to you that that cannot be a criteria for whether there be a supplementary question. On that criteria, quite frankly, every supplementary question could be important and, therefore, we would have a series of supplementary questions. The problem with that is that that would be in conflict with your own ruling, which is that you would expect supplementary questions essentially to be irregular in their frequency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis, I invite you to consider the matter, but certainly there seems absolutely no doubt that, if the practice continues on this basis, then there is clearly a change in the practice of the House. I believe that, if there is to be a change in the practice in the House, that should be the subject of a standing order change. That process has been the view of both sides of this House and, where there have been proposals for changes in the practice, they have been the subject of a Procedure Committee report. I therefore invite you, Mr Speaker, to consider that matter accordingly.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is, Mr Speaker, and I seek indulgence in the same way as the Leader of the House has sought it. It just seems to me that you have made a clear ruling as to how supplementary questions will be dealt with. The Leader of the House has got up today and&mdash;as he has on previous occasions&mdash;effectively said he does not like your ruling. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2261"> What he now wants to do is to threaten you with a change in standing orders so that that ruling cannot apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that the suggestion made by the member for Chifley is totally appropriate&mdash;that you cannot make a decision on whether a question, supplementary or otherwise, is in order until you have heard it. What should not be ruled out of order is the supplementary question before it is heard. I would argue, Mr Speaker, in consideration of this issue, that you stick to your guns: that you do not fold to the problem that has been raised by the Leader of the House because clearly they do not like your ruling. You made that ruling, having had the benefit of contributions from the member for Moncrieff and other members in this House. You have considered it and you have made very clear rulings. It seems to me that what is being done in this House is that the Leader of the House is attempting to stand over that ruling, to override it and to threaten you with the fact that, unless you renege on it, he will move a change in the standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House came into this House arguing that they were going to lift the standards. Here we have a recommendation on supplementary questions to improve the ability of this House to be informed and on the very occasion the Speaker takes the opportunity to ensure that happens they want to thug it. So I urge you, Mr Speaker, to stick with your original ruling but take on board the very sensible suggestion made by the honourable member for Chifley.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time the little Sir Echo over there who just interjected on me said it was a shame then. The point is, Mr Speaker, that you have made a ruling. I think&mdash;and I am sure members on this side think also&mdash;it would be grossly improper for the government to refer this matter back to the Procedure Committee. The effect of that would be to ask that committee to canvass your ruling and maybe vote you down. That would not be a healthy thing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, the thing is that you have made this decision. For every question that is asked in this House, you have the obligation and the duty&mdash;which you exercise well&mdash;of determining whether they are in order or not. In the same way that you determine whether <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2263"> a question to a minister or a member is in order, you can determine whether a supplementary question is in order or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not say at the beginning of question time, `You can't ask a question because the Speaker has to know whether it is in order before he hears it.' Anyone who suggested that would be seen as a nonsense. We have had other members here&mdash;including my colleague from the National Party&mdash;suggest that somehow or other you can divine what is in a member's mind when he asks a supplementary question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, as you very correctly ruled this afternoon, the question to the Attorney-General involved a matter that the whole House wanted to hear about. When the original question was asked of the Attorney, as is not normal in this place there was absolute silence, both from the government side and from the opposition side, because members were very interested in this issue. If the whole House is interested, I would suggest that it probably is a matter of some public importance.</PARA>

I would say in conclusion, Mr Speaker, that you have done the correct thing by cutting this Gordian knot and saying that you will allow supplementary questions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is time for the government&mdash;and I am glad to see the Treasurer (Mr Costello) coming back into the House&mdash;to stop and take a long, hard look at where it is going with Australia's economic management. Events and statements of the last few days&mdash;not least the humiliating debacle of the Premiers Conference&mdash;have reinforced the conclusion that we had from the outset: that the government's budget strategy is in total disarray and that it is addressing the wrong problem with the wrong solution. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's whole strategy&mdash;and let me look at it at its face value and put the most positive and economically responsible spin upon it that I can&mdash;is built around the stated need to deliver over the next two years a structural contribution of $8 billion to the budget, to either reduce the deficit or to achieve a surplus, depending on your starting assumptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We say that the revised growth forecast will mean a starting underlying deficit for 1996-97 of nothing like that $8 billion figure alleged. We also say&mdash;and I do not stop to debate it now&mdash;that your $8 billion figure has more to do with the government's need to pay for its pre-election pork-barrelling than anything to do with the present national accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, taking the coalition government's economic budget strategy on its own terms for the sake of this argument, its argument is that the so-called fiscal consolidation exercise is the only objective in Australian economic management that currently matters. They say there needs to be a massive new Commonwealth contribution to national saving and, in particular, that this saving contribution through the budget is necessary to address a current account deficit that is unsustainably high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, our view is that the primary economic objective that the government should be pursuing is quite different. We do not deny for a moment&mdash;never have&mdash;that Australia has a medium&hyphen; to long&hyphen;term saving problem which needs to be addressed over time. But we say that the immediate objective should be to achieve sustainable growth at a level which will enable an assault to be made on what is,  unquestionably, our priority continuing economic problem&mdash;that of high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our case could not have been made more powerfully than it was yesterday&mdash;reported in the press today&mdash;by Chris Caton, a very respected chief economist of Bankers Trust Australia, who had all sorts of nice things to say about the Treasurer. He said that unemployment, rather than a lower current account deficit, was the No. 1 economic problem facing the federal government. He said, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2265"> moreover, that the so-called deficit disease had been overly diagnosed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now all acutely conscious that, in pursuit of the objective I have described and which the government has set itself, the government has embarked upon a process of massive expenditure cutting which has already caused, and will certainly continue to cause, a massive amount of pain, the full extent of which is going to be apparent only on 20 August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The humiliating failure of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), because he was part of the act all the way through, to achieve a major ongoing structural reduction in Commonwealth payments to the states has made that pain infliction task that much harder&mdash;infinitely harder. Last week the government faced its first financial test: obtaining from the states a major structural contribution to the Commonwealth's financial position. Not only did the government fail that first test but it failed it, and the Treasurer failed it, in the most spectacular and humiliating fashion possible. The prancing poodle, standing around with a ribbon on his tail, fell splat on his face in the very first puddle that he confronted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That debacle last week had a number of different dimensions. It exposed the Treasurer to the most sustained and savage attack made by Premiers in living memory because of his broken promises not to increase taxes and to maintain state funding, because of the ignorance he demonstrated about basic elements of the present grants system, because of the way in which massive anomalies were going to be opened up by the composition of the sales tax exemption and because of the arrogant indifference that the Treasurer displayed to the states' legitimate concerns. I will not stop to refer to the way in which the states themselves referred to the Treasurer&mdash;that is all on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important aspect of that debacle, for present purposes, was that the government failed in its basic fiscal objective. What it demanded of the Premiers last week was $1,200 million a year in perpetuity, in sales tax, as a permanent structural contribution to the Commonwealth budget. What it got was, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at most, $100 million a year in contributions of that kind.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Mr GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly a sidelined Treasurer, a humiliated Treasurer, whose humiliation has been evident in his performance all this week. The truth is, in the words of Alan Wood&mdash;no friend, usually, of our side of politics&mdash;in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> , that `the Premiers Conference was for the government a total policy defeat'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having completely bungled the Premiers Conference, the government can now only meet its self&hyphen;imposed budget task by making even more massive cuts at the Commonwealth level. Some really very elementary arithmetic demonstrates that there now has to be, on any view, massive cuts to Commonwealth programs. There is $&half; billion&mdash;that is all&mdash;in ongoing structural savings flowing through from the Premiers Conference and from the related announcement of a three per cent reduction in tied payments to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth budget is about $130 billion; payments to the states are about a fifth of that amount. We are told Defence is going to be exempt from cuts. That is $10 billion that is out of the question. Another $10 billion is there in public debt interest that also cannot obviously be touched. Out of almost $50 billion worth of spending, the government has so far achieved just $&half; billion in ongoing structural saving. That means, as a matter of simple arithmetic calculation, that the only way the government can now reach its final budget target is to cut almost 10 per cent of the remaining $80 billion worth of Commonwealth spending there on the table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know what that spending includes: it is pensions, it is unemployment benefits, it is health and pharmaceutical spending, it is science and industry assistance, it is export and tourist promotion, it is environment spending, it is farm programs, it is the conduct of our foreign affairs&mdash;it is everything in the government repertoire that is up for grabs and potentially liable to suffer 10 per cent cuts across the board.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2266">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The magnitude of the task is so huge, so large, that expenditure cuts are manifestly, on present indications, not going to be sufficient. The government is going to have to find even more ways to break its tax promises, which have already been spectacularly broken with the GST on imports and now again with the new tax on state car purchases. The truth is there is simply no such thing as a free budget cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition say that the government is addressing the wrong problem with the wrong solution. There is one serious continuing problem in the Australian economy, and that is the problem of high unemployment. The only way that that problem can be addressed is through high and sustained growth at four per cent&mdash;a little bit more maybe. Far from contributing to that, the government's budget strategy will have precisely the opposite effect. If the $8 billion worth of cuts are in force or in operation over the next two years, they will take fully one per cent off the growth that would otherwise have been achievable, drastically through that contraction setting back the capacity to reduce unemployment below its present levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By addressing unemployment in this way it should also be acknowledged that we will be addressing what we concede to be the need to raise national saving. The best way to get national saving up is to keep growth up and to get unemployed people back to work. Not only is the Australian economy not in crisis, demanding the kind of attention the government is proposing to give it, but our economic fundamentals are in better shape than they have been at any time in the last 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister himself grudgingly conceded that point when talking not to his fellow Australians directly but rather to the international community, the cream of the world bankers gathered in Sydney earlier this month to whom he had to tell the truth, because if a different story got out it would have been disastrous for our reputation. He said, `The incoming government inherited an Australian economy which I have to say was, and I say it very positively, better than the curate's egg, better than just good in parts.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He could not say it in here, he would not say it in here and he would not say it at any stage during the campaign, but he has to acknowledge it, because that is the truth of the matter, when he talks to the international community, who are going to mark us up or down, not on election rhetoric but upon the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that the Australian economy is indeed chalking up an exceptionally good set of outcomes. We have had an unprecedented 4&frac34; years of continuous growth, now running, if the last quarter's figures are sustained, at above four per cent. Inflation is manifestly low and well under control. The underlying figure has peaked at just 3.3 per cent. It is set to fall back under three per cent to the two to three per cent range in the next few months. Everyone acknowledges that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current account deficit, while still a little bit higher than anyone thinks comfortable, has decreased from six per cent of GDP last year to less than 4&half; per cent this year. The foreign debt, associated with the net income payments that are making the current account deficit so large, is itself manifestly manageable with our present debt service ratio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the up-fortnight just after our last sitting and before the present one I travelled to four financial capitals in Asia, speaking during the course of that visit to something like 30 business and government leaders, a great many of whom take a very close interest in the Australian economy&mdash;watching its interest rates, the exchange rates and the macro&hyphen;management of it. In that two weeks I heard no adverse comment whatever suggesting that there was any perception that there were any basic problems needing redress of the kind involved in this budget strategy. In fact I heard nothing but compliments for the present condition of the Australian economy and the economic management over the last period of government which has made it what it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is the economy in good shape but the budget is too, as the government reluctantly conceded last week in the national fiscal outlook&mdash;that is, the document jointly prepared by the Commonwealth and state treasuries which analyses the underlying fiscal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2267"> position. That shows that, on the basis of realistic assumptions about levels of growth, the Commonwealth will achieve an underlying balance within the life of this parliament and that that underlying deficit will be completely eliminated without the need for hacking into valuable public services, infrastructure and everything else that is involved in the Commonwealth budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if growth proves to be in line with the currently excessively pessimistic&mdash;we say&mdash;official forecast, the national fiscal outlook shows that the underlying deficit will, even on those pessimistic assumptions, fall to just half of one per cent of GDP by the end of this term of parliament without any policy change and without any expenditure cutting. That is obviously a very low result by any international standards. In other words, the government's own document prepared with the states demonstrates that there is simply no need for the government's infliction of large&hyphen;scale budgetary pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is quite an extraordinary degree of pain involved in the budget cuts now being proposed&mdash;quite apart from their macro-economic contractionary impact on the whole economy, which I have already mentioned, and quite apart from the devastating impact on the lives and careers of many thousands of public servants who will lose their jobs. They will decimate labour market programs. They will vandalise higher education, emasculate our export drive, damage our relations with our Asian neighbours with the unilateral termination of aid arrangements and they will cause pain and hurt to vulnerable and needy members of our own community. There will simply not be the economic gain to outweigh all this pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's approach is a recipe for Australian economic anorexia. You do not make the economy stronger by starving it. It is just as crazy in economic management as it is in real human life to say that an organism is viable only when it is dying on its feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter, in short, is this: responsible management of the Australian economy at the present time demands a wholly different policy approach to the manic one on which the government is presently <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now embarked. The approach that is needed is one that adopts a longer time frame for addressing deficit reduction and related savings issues. It is an approach that goes for enhanced growth now and reduced unemployment now of the kind that is achievable if we can sustain growth at around four per cent or a little bit better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That kind of growth will deliver us the target objective of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. We were well on our way to achieving that in the last three years. You will now blow it if growth is reduced with a contractionary exercise of this kind. What we need is an approach to economic management which focuses on what is happening in the real economy and not in the money economy. We need an approach to economic management that is not preoccupied just with national accounting balances but an approach which puts people first.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very surprised by the abrupt end to that speech; I do not suppose I should have been. Never before have I seen a performance which bespoke of the fact that a tactics committee sat around and said, `We'd better do an MPI today. Who will do it? Gareth, we'll write you a speech; get up and read it out.' There was no conviction and no understanding, just a recitation of extensively prepared script which you stood and read out. I know that you do that because the last time you did this you sent the MPI script around to my office afterwards. It was bad enough having to listen to it, let alone have it arrive in my office for reading thereafter. There has been no substance at all in the matters that have been raised in the MPI.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to come to a very substantive matter at the outset. I want to place on the record the absolute deceit that was practised by whoever it was that sent a letter out on the letterhead of the Hon. Stephen Martin MP, 14 June 1996, saying that the person&mdash;whoever it be&mdash;was writing to the veterans community to suggest that, as a consequence of an announcement by me, sales tax exemptions were to be removed and TPI pensioners would now be slugged an additional 20 per cent to 30 per cent on the cost of motor vehicles. That was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2268"> utter deceit. If Mr Martin did not write that letter, he'd better find out who is circulating forgeries on his behalf, trying to sow fear and disharmony on the basis of falsehood in the veterans community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After this was exposed by the minister in question time today, rather than having an apology we had people from the front bench yelling out that this was somehow true. The frontbench of the Labor Party tried to reconfirm it. Absolute deceit! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), and shadow Treasurer, ought to have stood up here and repudiated it. He ought to have disclosed that this was a forgery sent out on behalf of Stephen Martin and disassociated the opposition from it, or he ought to have repudiated it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it entirely clear: it was never proposed that item 96 of the Sales Tax Act, motor vehicles for disabled veterans, which is what this was about, would be altered in any way or shape whatsoever. The press release that was put out enumerated by name all of those items of the Sales Tax Act that we had proposed to deal with. All of them were government instrumentalities&mdash;state, territory or Commonwealth. It was never item 96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it incredible that the Labor Party could have gone out intending to sow, and is sowing, fear and discord in veterans, TPI veterans, in relation to their motor cars to try to score deceitful political points. Hearing the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition go right through his representation with a lack of conviction and not repudiate that kind of behaviour at all was just a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say also that this is obviously an opposition which is yet to come to terms with reality. If we listen to the shadow Treasurer, all we need to do with the Australian economy is sit back and do nothing. I do not think the reason why they lost the 2 March election has even occurred to them yet. All we have to do, according to the shadow Treasurer, is nothing&mdash;just sit back and it will all fix itself. He says all we have to do is grow the economy to create jobs. But how are we going to grow the economy with the current account deficit like it is? When the Deputy Leader of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Opposition was in Asia, did he ever ask what their savings ratios were and how we could sustain growth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did you ever ask them why it was that under your regime savings as a percentage of GDP were down 16 per cent to 17 per cent? Had it ever occurred to you why the current account deficit had got so bad under your government? Why is it that when growth was gearing up in 1994 your government raised interest rates to deal with the current account problem, to deal with the inflationary risks of unsustainable growth, yet you say now all we have to do is sit back and grow it faster again?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not be able to do that unless we start addressing the savings imbalance in this country. If you want to do that, the area where the Commonwealth government has the most direct control is its own budget. This should not come as any surprise to anybody in the Labor Party or in the previous Labor government. It was the Labor government that commissioned the Vince FitzGerald savings report. That report said that the persistent failure in relation to the running down of savings belonged to the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be at a stage of economic recovery after four or five years and still be running an $8 billion deficit is an indictment of economic management. When would we ever get to balance, let alone back into surplus to repay some of the debts accrued during recession? We cannot undo it until we get to balance and then start saving. To be running an $8 billion deficit four to five years into recovery means we are making it worse. There would be no change if this opposition were in government; that is, the situation would continue to deteriorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2269"> One salient fact should always reverberate in the minds of those in the Labor Party who are trying to get a new approach to economic policy: Commonwealth debt tripled to $100 billion over the last four years. When were you ever going to bring it down? Those opposite make these unintentional comments. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, for example, one of the reasons why we cannot cut expenditures is that we cannot do any thing about public debt interest. We cannot. We cannot do anything except try to repay debt. That is the only way we can do anything about the public debt interest. Not only is it one of those permanent items factored into budgets, but if you had your way there would be no change and it would grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I try to make is that, if we are factoring $10 billion of interest into this year's budget and we continue to run up debt, how much are we closing off the options of future Australians? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made the point, unintentionally, that options have been closed off to us as a government by a $10 billion public debt interest bill. But if we were to follow Labor's course, the `run up the bankcard' course, how many more options would be closed off to future generations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I talk about the intergenerational unfairness and the financial abuse in relation to future generations. Unless we can stabilise that debt, unless we can get it under control and, hopefully, pay some of it back, we will be closing off many more options. Treasurers standing at this dispatch box in five, 10, 15 and 20 years time would be talking not about being locked in with that percentage of their budget but about being locked in to a far greater extent. What we are talking about is reducing the run-down on savings and getting back to a balance after four to five years of economic recovery, after tripling debt over the last four years.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is like a group of saboteurs who have blown up a bridge. When someone comes to reconstruct it, they want to come back and stop the reconstruction. The opposition wants to stop the privatisation and the savings. We get nothing but negativity out of this opposition. Has it announced a position, for example, on the wholesale sales tax on motor vehicles where they are used partly or wholly for private use? Has it announced a position? No, it has not announced a position. If it can, it will try to get away with writing letters to sow fear in the Australian community without announcing a position. If it were to announce a position, it would be legitimately criticised for having allowed the situation to have gone on for so long, even though it supported it. Can it announce a position on it? No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is your position on Commonwealth-state funding? Would you have ensured that the states had additional funding? We have not heard a position on that either. If you had taken that position, how would you have paid for it? It is all very well to go out and say that you will increase funding to the states year by year in real terms when you do not have the money. What would have been your position? Absolute silence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that this opposition fears more than anything else is that if this government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2270"> attends to the fiscal problem and the savings problem it will be able to do two things. First, it will be able to sustain growth, and that is what the opposition fears. More than anything else, it also fears that we will be able to take pressure off interest rates. The thing that would really worry this opposition is if the fiscal repair takes pressure off interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know this because of what has come from the mouth of the shadow Treasurer. The shadow Treasurer said on 1 May 1996 in this House:</PARA>

Your big economic contribution was that there could not be interest rate falls on the basis of the accord having been abandoned. As a result of that, you said that there would not be reductions. But there were reductions. The reductions were there, and they have been made for home buyers. If we can repair the fiscal task, there can be further reductions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing that would really get to the craw of the opposition if we were successful and they could not defeat us in the Senate is our taking the pressure off interest rates. That would really get to the craw of the opposition. Essentially, they have set themselves on a course of doing everything they can to defeat that fiscal consolidation. So they will go out, if they see the opportunity, and write off to veterans communities to try to get political points. They will refuse to take positions in relation to wholesale sales taxes. They will do what they can to defeat the Telstra privatisation and the savings measures. They will do what they can to stand up here and take the politically easy option.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, the opposition will not give any support to what is in the national interest. What is in the national interest in this country is savings and sustainable growth which will generate jobs and give us the opportunity to stabilise interest rates and debt. That will give further options to future Australians, who will not be locked in by the debt legacy of Labor. These things are really important. We do not say that they are easy. If they were easy, the 13 years of failed Labor government would have attended better to them. But it is important that they be addressed. It is important that we make a start on them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's MPI talks about the disarray and economic irresponsibility of the government's budget strategy. The first question to ask is whether there really is a government budget strategy. Those of us who have been watching events occurring&mdash;I admit that this year, unlike previous years, I have been watching from a different perspective&mdash;have seen the government lurching from one crisis to another around the construction of this year's budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we can say is that the government is committed to big cuts in expenditure for education, health and social services across the board. We can also say that they have identified a thing called a black hole. I remember some years ago taking my kid to see a film produced by Warner Brothers about a black hole. Quite possibly, there was a character in there who reminded me of the Treasurer (Mr Costello). Essentially, it was a science fiction film. So much of what the Treasurer comes up with in this chamber is science fiction. One wonders after following his speech whether to laugh, cry, stamp one's feet or just give him the Oscar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we do not know whether the black hole involves $8 billion or whether it even exists. The Treasurer does not know whether it exists. None of us know for certain. Projections are the story here, and that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2271"> is a fact. I quote an article from Tim Colebatch in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age </EMPHASIS>of 1 June, which mentions the recent adjustment in growth figures that came through for the March quarter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bureau of Statistics' estimate that output grew 1.8 per cent in the March quarter, and 4.8 per cent in the year to March, clearly changes the numbers in a Budget framed on the assumption of 3.25 per cent growth.

<PARA>that is the March growth figures&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is the Government's attempt to make us believe its Budget cuts were necessitated by the "$8 billion Beazley black hole" it inherited from Labor. But this always was a shabby lie, and it got the fate it deserved.</PARA>
<PARA>We will not know for sure exactly what the situation is until the budget is brought down and we get those final figures. Until that time there is a bit of guesswork going on. There is an awful lot of guesswork going on, particularly by the government. Essentially, as circumstances have changed, they have endeavoured to say, `Circumstances haven't really changed. This thing still exists. It is still as big as we said. It may even be bigger. It may be so huge that more will be required to be done.' You cannot continue to chant the mantra `Black hole, black hole, black hole'. You are only fooling yourselves. No-one believes that that is the case. We know the circumstances have to be confirmed over time.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes are further examples of a government determined to achieve a Budget outcome without enough consideration of the fall&hyphen;out of individual decisions.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the Government would be wise not to be so determined to achieve its official aim that it cuts spending that will in the long term help reduce both government and foreign deficits by increasing employment and exports.</PARA>
<PARA>You have to look to the future with these things. You have to look at what you as a government do and spend money on. If you take a classic accountancy argument to the operation of government, you can arrive at the sorts of results we are seeing coming through from this government and at what will happen in the coming budget. But you have to look beyond that to the impact your expenditure will have and the effect it will have in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The MPI question also relates to irresponsibility and disarray. This has often been commented on in relation to the events of last week's Premiers Conference. I want to quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. I have to quote in some detail because I find it a very interesting article by Mike Seccombe. I admit that this article relates to early on in the farce of the Premiers Conference, but it is very relevant to what we are seeing here, the shell game the government is playing with its economic actions. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In one of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pink Panther</EMPHASIS>  movies, the late great Peter Sellers, playing Inspector Jacques Clouseau, asks a man: "Does your dog bite?" After the man says no, Sellers extends a hand to the dog. It savages him. Then the man says: "That is not my dog."  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2272"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">See that scene as a metaphor for the actions of the Howard/Costello Government over taxation, indeed, its actions on a range of areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before the election, the Australian electorate wanted the answer to the question: "Will you bite us with new taxes?" The answer, the promise, was no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The electorate extended its hand and has been bitten, to the tune of $1.2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treasurer Peter Costello's response to the cries of pain: "That is not my tax."</PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly his dog. I stress, so as not to mislead the House in any way, that this quote relates to early actions at the Premiers Conference when the sales tax matter was raised. We have seen an adjustment occur post that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about disarray and the government being totally out of control, as it was last week, we have to look at some of the comments that were made during the cut and thrust of the Premiers Conference, which were not denied later by some of the conservative political leaders across the states. I quote one in particular, again from that Seccombe article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Victorian Treasurer, Mr Stockdale, was as succinct and bitter as any, saying the Federal Coalition Government had broken both its promise not to impose new taxes and its promise to maintain the levels of funding to the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA>Post those quotes the situation changed. We then had the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) come forward and say, `No, it was all amicable. It was all fine. The Premiers basically said, "No, we want you to take some of our money." They got their wallet out and said, "Take it. We know you have got a problem, so take our money."'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the detail of that, you have to look at what was said earlier on. We have had quotes from a range of conservative political state leaders that they were bitter and annoyed about the fact that the government had moved away from its promise to maintain the levels of funding to the states and territories and had attacked their grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any reasonable observer and any fair-minded observer can look to what occurred at that Premiers Conference and know for a fact that the Treasurer took forward a proposal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that he had been force&hyphen;fed by Treasury. Basically, he learnt his lines, as he is very good at doing, and chanted them like he was once again in front of the Old Bailey or on the stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Uproar and furore occurred, and Howard had to bail him out. Because the states realised that against their better judgment and against their wishes they would have to concede an element of their grant basis in order to arrive at a successful conclusion to that conference, they came forth with an alternative proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To suggest in this House that they said, `Here, we want you to have our money,' that the impact of the tax increases is not coming through now in some of the states as a result of the Howard and Costello performance at that Premiers Conference and that what was agreed by the states was done totally freely and of their own volition is plain ridiculous. It has never happened before at Premiers Conferences. There has always been cut and thrust debate and negotiation, but in the end a deal is struck. But in this case the deal was basically a form of extortion. There was great disarray and chaos. The government's performance around the formation of this budget brings it no credit.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Richmond)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.31 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I found it very interesting to listen to the two opposition speakers on this matter of public importance concerning the disarray and economic responsibility of the government's budget strategy. It is a bit rich coming from the now opposition when you look at their record. This was very amply demonstrated by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). I could not help but remember comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in question time. He referred to the bill going through the New South Wales parliament as `Beazley's deficit act'. The government is embarking on its current budget strategy to redress the imbalance the Labor Party had for 13 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad the Treasurer was able to elucidate on this to the now shadow treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). Obviously the shadow Treasurer has spent too much time overseas. He has not realised that most of the damage incurred to date has been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2273"> caused by the previous government. It is very interesting when you look at the surplus issue to see how we are trying to address the budget deficit we have inherited. First, let us look at the duplicity in what the opposition has been talking about. Late last year, in 1995, we had a situation where they talked about there being a surplus this year. Then it was mentioned that they were not sure. Then there was a denial, and then they mentioned fraud and deceit after we released the budget deficit figures. Then they tried to blame us&mdash;and now they are passing the parcel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us recount a little bit of history. I recall the previous Prime Minister saying, `The budget, for God's sake, is in surplus for this year. In the middle of next year we will have surpluses running for three years consecutively.' That was stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in February 1996. The now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), who is trying to pass the buck, said to the Australian Pensioners Association, `We are going to have a small budget surplus.' Then, all of a sudden, as we started to approach the election, on 19 February, he said, as reported by AAP, `Well, we don't have meaningful sets of statistics to indicate what the bottom line might be.' He was not too sure. Then, after the election and after we inherited the Treasury forecasts and estimates, there was a sense of denial. He actually admitted that these figures were fraudulent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, after realising that that was not a particularly good excuse, the Leader of the Opposition tried to blame us. Now we see the deceitful tactics which have been revealed today about the scaring of TPI pensioners. These are the types of tactics that, unfortunately, members of the previous government are resorting to. It is important to note that the previous Prime Minister and the now opposition leader mentioned last year that they were looking for a $720 million surplus. Quite clearly, the actions they took were deceitful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Treasurer has mentioned, after 17 quarters of growth, wouldn't you expect our current account deficit to be better? Wouldn't you expect that this country would start to have a vibrancy? No. After 17 quarters of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> growth we have inherited an $8 billion deficit. When we look at the foreign debt angle of $180 billion we can see that Commonwealth borrowings have gone up 300 per cent since 1991. Yet those opposite parade in this parliament that they are the great masters of economic management. They are going along exactly the same course Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria did under previous ALP administrations. Thank goodness we won on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current account deficit is important for overseas borrowings and for the way financial institutions value Australia. An important point made by the Treasurer was that just prior to the election interest rates were on a downward spiral. As soon as the budget deficit information became available prior to the election, the 10&hyphen;year bond rate, which is the benchmark of Australian financial currency, rose dramatically for fear of the budget deficit. When it came out, the bond rate gained about another 40 basis points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we are seeing interest rates starting to stabilise and go down, which is vindication of what the government is trying to do in balancing the books. As the Treasurer pointed out&mdash;and I know he is listening&mdash;variable rates are falling as well. This helps the mums and dads with their mortgages. How can the shadow Treasurer stand up here and beat his chest, claiming that we have irresponsible management? Clearly the variable bond market is going down. People have confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was most interested in the shadow Treasurer's speech when he was talking about the problems of savings and alleged pork&hyphen;barrelling by the government. Any pork&hyphen;barrelling was done under their administration, particularly over labour market programs where they spent 95 per cent of their budget. As a matter of fact, they overspent&mdash;and that is why we brought $30 million into this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about asset sales? At least we are doing the right thing by the Australian community and privatising those assets to repay debts and for our Natural Heritage Trust. But, no, they flogged off the CBA, Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and Qantas&mdash;all into <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2274"> recurrent expenditure. That is the problem we have inherited. We saw record bankruptcies. Blind Freddy could tell you that the record was set under the 13 years of ALP administration. Yet they claimed that they looked after the working class. Why is it that in the more than 10 years from 1983 to now our income ranking for the working class&mdash;the true believers, allegedly&mdash;has gone from No. 10 in the OECD to No. 21?  The hypocrisy is rich&mdash;but we have always known that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must admit that the efforts made at the recent Premiers Conference just go to demonstrate that, whilst other states acknowledge the need to show expenditure restraint to balance the budget to get financial confidence back into Australia, the response of the Labor Party in New South Wales was to whack on a tax. Where are they going to whack it? On superannuation contributions, the very thing that the previous Prime Minister was so proud of. They are not showing restraint. They are showing the classic trick of putting up taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this government is being very responsible in approaching the budget from not only a monetary angle but also a fiscal angle. That is where the Labor Party failed abysmally during the last 13 years. It was always the hand on the interest rate lever. They cranked it up, they cranked it down and that is why we went through this boom&hyphen;bust mentality. That is why we are still running a current account deficit; we are still running a very low savings ratio. That is why we have to address this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to hear the shadow Treasurer's little analogy about falling into a puddle. He must still be floundering in the Franklin River. He sent the F111s down there 13 years ago because of his misjudgment. It would be better for him to stay in Australia and learn about economics&mdash;his colleague the member for Bruce (Mr Griffin) demonstrated that neither of them know very much&mdash;rather than parading on about foreign affairs, which he was well known for in his previous portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to my conclusion. Isn't it interesting that they are beating the mantra of our allegedly irresponsible budgetary management when even their own left wing have been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regurgitating the elements of bringing back a GST? What is this opposition about? They deny that they ever had a budget deficit, even though they claimed there was a surplus. Now they are trying to pass the buck. Even in their own backroom deals by the left wing, they are talking about extra increases in taxes with a goods and services tax. Quite frankly, they have no credibility. They had 13 years to set the record straight. They were thrown out with the biggest mandate the coalition has had since the 1930s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Bruce, talked about dogs. I can tell you that they are going to be on the chain for a long while the way they are barking and carrying on. I commend the Treasurer for his efforts. I just hope that in the next three, six or nine years&mdash;if the member for Holt is still here&mdash;he will learn something about economics.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I crave your indulgence to amplify an answer I gave in question time. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) asked me a question concerning Mrs Janet Holmes a Court's appointment by the former government as chairman of the Centenary of Federation Council. In the course of that answer, I responded to an interjection concerning alleged statements by the Deputy Prime Minister and continuing Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Tim Fischer. In answer to an interjection by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), who inferred that Mr Fischer had endorsed Mrs Holmes a Court's appointment, I said the acting leader had informed me that he did no such thing, `so there you are'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2275"> I had a subsequent discussion with the Deputy Prime Minister, who informed me that in late January he was telephoned by Mr John Paterson, who is the Federal President of the National Party of Australia and an acquaintance of Mrs Holmes a Court. The appoint ment of Janet Holmes a Court to that position was raised by Mr Paterson, I understand at the request of Mrs Holmes a Court, and Mr Fischer has informed me that he does not recall all the detail of it but he does not dispute what Mr Paterson told him today&mdash;that is, that in response to the question, `Does the coalition have any problems with Mrs Holmes a Court's appointment?' Mr Fischer said, `I have not any problems but I do not know about John Howard.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At no stage did Mr Fischer or anybody else on behalf of the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, or Mrs Holmes a Court approach me to ask whether I supported the appointment. If I had been approached, I would have said&mdash;as I said in the parliament today&mdash;that it was the sort of appointment that I could not endorse and that what should happen is that we should have the election and then whoever won should make the appointment. I stand by everything I said previously. I did not intend any particular discourtesy to Mrs Holmes a Court. I had a perfectly amiable discussion with her in Melbourne 10 days ago. The fact is that I had some other people in mind for this position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appointment was announced by Mr Keating on Australia Day, a day or two before the election was announced. We were clearly in contemplation of a caretaker period. This rather unfortunate public toing&hyphen;and&hyphen;froing on it has been fuelled somewhat by Phillip Adams, I have to say, who has been saying around communications circles that he is going to make a big issue of it. This could all have been avoided if Mr Keating had done the decent thing by ringing me and saying, `Look, this is a sensitive appointment, do you have any problems?' I would have politely said, `I bear her no malice, but I have somebody else in mind. Let the voters decide who they want to make the appointment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I felt technically that what I had informed the House of in good faith earlier was slightly in error, and that I should explain to the House that I was acting in good faith on what the Deputy Prime Minister had previously told me. I just want to say again that I did have somebody else in mind for the position. I think Mrs Janet Holmes a Court is a person <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of great ability&mdash;she is doing a very good job for the government on the board of the Reserve Bank&mdash;but if I had been approached about her appointment to this position before the election, I would not have endorsed it.</PARA></SPEECH>

That article states: while Janet tried to contact him, John Howard, there was an immediate and enthusiastic response from Tim Fischer&mdash;`a very good appointment, I'll support it and I'm sure I speak for John as well'. That is the quote from which we operated in asking the question of you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it may have been adjacent to an election, it was still not in a caretaker period and it was still an appointment that was capable of being made. As for Mrs Holmes a Court&mdash;with her extraordinary business record, with her extraordinary connections with the arts, the Aboriginal community, the media, the education processes generally plus business, including overseas business, export activity, investment overseas&mdash;I really cannot think of a better appointment to such a position.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr TIM FISCHER</EMPHASIS> (Farrer&mdash;Minister for Trade) (4.46 p.m.) Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence: just to complete this matter, I would add that I was out of the country when that particular article appeared. It has now been highlighted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). I refute that particular statement and stand by the exactitude of the statement made this afternoon by the Federal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2276"> President of the National Party, John Paterson, as to his recollection of the conversation. I am not in a position to refute that as I do not recall it in absolute detail. It was at the end of January, the start of what has been a very busy six months. As I say, I do not refute it and I quote that my response was, `I haven't any problems, but I don't know about John Howard.' That sounds about right because on all these matters I would be only of a mind to speak of an informal reaction from me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At no stage did I issue any formal statement and, to the best of my knowledge, I have not spoken to Phillip Adams or Janet Holmes a Court in the course of this particular year. I did mention Janet Holmes a Court in one other context recently during a media conference in Indonesia. I was asked to nominate two ladies of particular note with regard to their contribution to the community. I acknowledge that I said I would nominate two. In the context of the particular question at the time, I referred to one as being Janet Holmes a Court and the other as being Sarah Henderson. I acknowledge that and stand very much by the absolute clarification and amplification which has been given this afternoon by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on this matter.</PARA></INTERJECT></SPEECH></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to enter the debate on the matter of public importance, proposed by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). I begin by observing that it seems to me a little early to have an MPI to debate the government's budget strategy when all about it cannot be known until the Treasurer (Mr Costello) does his star turn on 20 August, which is some two months hence. It is obviously the case that detailed deliberations have yet to be undertaken and, if I am not seriously mistaken, some strategic decisions will be needed before the budget is finally locked away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the opposition's MPI is a precedent, I suppose we can expect a similarly worded matter of public importance before the House prior to next year's budget in November&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> December this year. In other words, this seems to be very premature. Furthermore, I should say that it is a bit over the top to describe as `strategy' what little we already know and the opposition party already knows about the government's budgetary intentions. Certainly we did not anticipate the Treasurer's pre&hyphen;emptive ambit claim before the recent Premiers Conference&mdash;not the most clever ploy of all time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Neville Chamberlain, before his now infamous meeting in Munich with Hitler which led to him claiming `peace in our time', resorted to a quote from part I of Shakespeare's Henry IV to describe his mission&mdash;and remember, this is before he went to Munich. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Out of this nettle, danger, may we pluck this flower, safety.</PARA>
<PARA>If wholesale scrapping of sales tax exemptions across the board for state and territory governments was the Treasurer's nettle or danger, the flower he plucked will not decorate a specimen vase. At best, he plucked half a flower. Let us hope for Australia's sake that the aftermath of the Treasurer's expedition to meet the premiers and chief ministers is not the disaster of the type of Chamberlain's making, and that the Commonwealth does not find itself in an all-out war with the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because I know that the Treasurer is familiar with an excerpt from it but not necessarily the title or author, I might refer him to another piece of poetry. The author was Arthur Hugh Clough, and my message to the Treasurer is in the title. The title is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Say not the struggle nought availeth</EMPHASIS>. The recent struggle with the Premiers was not all for nothing, I am pretty sure. There were a number of positives that came out of it. Hopefully, one is a realisation that neither all the resilience nor all the wisdom is to be found in Canberra or even in the Sydney-Melbourne-Canberra axis. While I am in the mood, I might also remind the Treasurer of the words from Clough's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Say not the struggle nought availeth</EMPHASIS> with which I know him to be familiar. That passage reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And not by eastern windows only, when daylight comes, comes the light, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2277"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In front when sun climbs slow, how slowly,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But westward, look, the land is bright . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The land is bright. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you look as far west as possible from the Sydney-Melbourne-Canberra triangle, the land is bright. The excesses of state Labor governments have been reversed. WA Inc. is receding into the sunset, although the scars of the skin cancers that have been removed have not quite healed, as only my friend and colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) would understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Six Independents from Western Australia sit in the state and Commonwealth parliaments. That cannot be bad. What more could we ask for? Perhaps an end to the rorting in the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party might be a fair expectation, but nothing is perfect. With that defect in the view of the Liberal Party's western horizon, we might claim `Say not the struggle nought availeth' with posthumous apologies to Clough&mdash;not Harold Clough, the author of the famous Clough report into the shenanigans of the Western Australia Liberal Party, but Clough the erstwhile poet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the land is still bright the further westward we look, its brilliance is somewhat diminished by the perception that the diesel fuel rebate is to be scrapped. The Treasurer must by now be very well aware of the serious disquiet about this matter among primary producers in the west, and probably throughout Australia. In the budget considerations, soon to receive detailed attention, the Treasurer should think very deeply about changes to the level and the application of the rebate as well as the timing of possible changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the meantime&mdash;that is, before the budget is brought down in August&mdash;the mining, farming and horticultural industries should be told at the very earliest opportunity if the rebate is not to be scrapped or reduced, otherwise confidence&hyphen;sapping uncertainty will prevail. Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, I know you will understand exactly what I mean because you have vast horticultural industries in your electorate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is intended to change the diesel fuel rebate provisions, affected industries should be put out of their collective misery and told as soon as the decision is ratified. The government should not wait until the budget if they take that decision before then. Both short&hyphen;term and long-term planning within those mighty industries are now in a state of flux and uncertainty, which must be eliminated to allow decision makers in those industries to get on with the future as soon as possible. The message I would like to leave with the Treasurer in concluding my remarks in this matter of public importance debate is: in my opinion, an early decision on the diesel fuel rebate is not only desirable but also essential.</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Introduction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key challenges this nation faces is that of  preserving its natural environmental capital for the benefit of our children and grandchildren. Australians overwhelmingly believe that environmental protection and economic growth are equally important. The challenge for Australia is to sustain the rapid advances in living standards that have been achieved in the 20th century in a way that protects the life support systems which are increasingly threatened. This is a challenge that all governments around the world must accept. Every society has a responsibility to future generations to leave an environment which is at least as healthy and productive as the one they inherit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this bill is to tackle these challenges head&hyphen;on by establishing a $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. This trust is the major mechanism for the implementation of the coalition government's policies for the protection and rehabilitation of Australia's natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The initiatives to be funded from the trust are aimed at reversing the decline in our natural capital. They will contribute to the conservation, repair and enhancement of Australia's unique environment into the 21st century. This is the first time in the nation's history a Commonwealth government has established a trust for such a purpose. The trust will provide funding certainty for important natural heritage programs of this coalition government for the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall the government will spend an additional $1.15 billion over the next five years on a comprehensive package of measures aimed at tackling the environmental and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sustainable agricultural challenges facing Australia. The trust is the centrepiece upon which this extensive package of measures depends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia must seize the opportunity to play a leading role as a clean, green nation. This objective not only is of environmental importance but will produce major economic benefits and job opportunities for regional Australia and the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a key plank in meeting this challenge. It is part of the largest and most comprehensive commitment to action on the environment and to restoring our natural capital by any national government in Australia's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me put the initiative in its proper context. We have inherited an environment in serious difficulties. Little of our natural environment has escaped modification, and what remains is under increasing pressure. It is estimated that over five million hectares of native vegetation were cleared during the decade between 1983 and 1993. Once widespread species are declining. Some 20 mammal, 20 bird and 68 plant species are already presumed extinct. Many of our wetlands have disappeared and the water quality and flows of our key rivers are dramatically reduced. The productive capacity of our land has been damaged through erosion, salinity, loss of structure or acidification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These problems have a direct impact on people in our community who, quite rightly, expect quality water to drink and clean air to breathe. They do not want to see precious soils blown away in the wind, blue-green algae spoiling our rivers and streams, or our unique flora and fauna at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of this trust enables Australia to take a dramatic leap forward in the sustainable management of our natural capital. It provides the opportunity to take a new approach to environmental protection and natural resource management, and to design and integrate programs to ensure strong multiple outcomes. I would now like to explain the trust in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Operation of the trust</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will establish the trust and provide for it to be known as the Natural Heritage <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2281"> Trust of Australia Reserve. The initial capital of $1 billion to be invested in the trust will come from the proceeds of the partial sale of Telstra. In effect, the transfer of funds from the partial sale of Telstra into the Natural Heritage Trust represents a transfer from investment in a telecommunications company to an investment in natural capital. Maintaining and restoring this natural capital is an investment in the wellbeing of future generations of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For too long Australia has taken its extraordinary endowment of natural resources for granted. We have failed to take into account the depletion and degradation of our natural capital and we have failed to make the investments in management and works necessary to arrest and reverse the depreciation of our natural resources. It is not by chance that the government's natural heritage package is focused around the big issues of our time&mdash;land and water degradation, coastal protection and the conservation of biodiversity. Each has a compelling claim on our resources, but if we were to simply deal with each separately the results would be modest. We would be perpetuating the mistakes of the past if we were to attempt to deal with each of these issues in isolation of each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trust, and the range of initiatives it will support, is based on a recognition that an integrated approach is needed right across the spectrum of problems we face. The initiatives to be funded from the trust have therefore been strategically developed around five interdependent environmental packages:</PARA>
<PARA>. vegetation;</PARA>
<PARA>. rivers;</PARA>
<PARA>. biodiversity;</PARA>
<PARA>. landcare; and</PARA>
<PARA>. coasts and oceans.</PARA>
<PARA>Within these five packages, $700 million of the money invested in the trust from the partial sale of Telstra will be devoted entirely to five capital projects aimed at maintaining, protecting and replenishing Australia's natural environmental capital. These projects, which will be conducted over a five&hyphen;year period, are:</PARA>
<PARA>. the national vegetation initiative;</PARA>
<PARA>. the Murray-Darling 2001 project;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>. the national reserve system;</PARA>
<PARA>. the national land and water resources audit; and</PARA>
<PARA>. the coasts and clean seas initiative.</PARA>
<PARA>These five capital initiatives will be complemented by a comprehensive range of other environmental and sustainable agriculture initiatives announced as part of this government's saving our natural heritage and reviving the heartland packages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for funds in the trust to be invested and for all income from such investments to be returned to the trust. The bill also enables funds from a number of other sources to be paid into the trust. This will include, for example, budget appropriations and gifts or bequests. All interest earned from the trust and other non-Telstra moneys invested in the trust will be able to be spent on other environmental and sustainable agriculture projects, such as rivercare, endangered species, landcare, and addressing the management and control of weeds and feral animals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the five years, $300 million will remain in the trust as a capital base. This money will be held in perpetuity, to continue to enhance the quality of our environment for all Australians. The trust will be the source of funds for a number of the government's environment and sustainable land and water programs, which are managed within both the environment and primary industries and energy portfolios.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To facilitate the management of the trust as a partnership between the two portfolios, the bill establishes a Natural Heritage Board, comprising the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The board will provide a formal mechanism for liaison and cooperation between the two portfolios on all matters relating to the trust, to ensure a comprehensive integration of the government's environment and sustainable agriculture programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reflects an historic recognition that protection of the environment for future generations can only be achieved through an integrated response to our environmental and sustainable agriculture problems. I would now <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2282"> like to describe the five environmental packages in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">1. Vegetation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably the most compelling environmental challenge for Australia is turning around the relentless long&hyphen;term decline in the quality and extent of our native vegetation. It is estimated we have cleared 20 billion trees over the past 200 years and, with mechanisation, the pace of clearing increased dramatically over the past 30 to 40 years. Native vegetation communities, including grasslands, shrublands, woodlands and forests, represent priceless natural capital&mdash;underpinning biodiversity values, catchment hydrology, water quality, and of course the unique character of Australian landscapes. There is also a developing consciousness of the importance of remnant vegetation to sustainable agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's national vegetation initiative will ameliorate the land and water degradation and the loss of biodiversity associated with the reduction in native vegetation cover since European settlement. The initiative will support a range of revegetation activities and develop incentives for the protection and sustainable management of remnant native vegetation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our objective is to ensure that, for the first time since European settlement, the rate of revegetation in Australia exceeds the rate of vegetation clearance. Funding will also be provided for a related initiative, the farm forestry program. This will further promote and encourage the establishment of commercial farm forestry activities in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national vegetation initiative provides for the establishment of an expert advisory council for sustainable vegetation management which will have the task of providing advice to the government on the initiative. In addition to the direct benefits of such environmental restoration, this initiative will also provide an important addition to carbon sinks for greenhouse gases in Australia, contributing to the global effort to address climate change. The national vegetation initiative represents an historic opportunity to put in place the first integrated national program for protecting and enhancing Australia's native vegetation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">2. Rivers</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The restoration of our waterways must become a key environmental priority for all Australians. It is an integral part of ecological processes on which all life depends and supports a wide range of uses&mdash;industry, irrigation, urban and rural development, recreation and landscape amenity&mdash;all of which are fundamental to our quality of life. Yet we have not treated our scarce water resources wisely. In the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin, for example, if all the water allocations were implemented, 90 per cent of the average natural flow would be diverted. That system now experiences drought level flows three years out of every four, compared to one in 20 years under natural circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government recognises that there is a need to strike a better balance between consumptive and environmental demands for water. While current activities being carried out through joint government and community programs are meeting with some success, the government believes that substantially more resources need to be allocated to improve the sustainable management and conservation of rivers and other waterways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Murray-Darling 2001 project is an integral component of this government's comprehensive package of water reform measures, designed to clean up our waterways and coastline. It will complement other new programs such as the national rivercare initiative, which will focus on ensuring sustainable management, rehabilitation and conservation of waterways outside the Murray-Darling Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also committed to enhancing the national wetlands program, to encourage the conservation of Australia's precious wetlands. These initiatives will result in improved water quality, increased environmental flows, retention of essential habitat and improved waste management practices to enable reuse of waste water, stormwater and sewage.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">3. Biodiversity</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's plants and animals have evolved in isolation from the rest of the world for over 40 million years. As a result, we have been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2283"> endowed with a splendid variety of life forms that are found nowhere else on earth. We have a great responsibility to care for and protect this unique natural heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national reserve system initiative will develop, in conjunction with the states and territories, a comprehensive, adequate and representative national reserve system. The reserve system will incorporate prime examples of Australia's biodiversity and significant natural values. It will ensure that a representative wide range of ecosystems are protected. This will include, for example, wilderness, wild rivers, wetlands, salt marshes and grasslands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reserve system will also reflect the need to protect and promote the recovery of species and ecological communities that are endangered or vulnerable. The national reserve system will complement off-reserve conservation activities which will include other elements of this investment package, such as the national vegetation initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also recognises the importance of providing specific resources towards ensuring the recovery of endangered species and ecological communities and will therefore provide additional funding for the endangered species program.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">4. Landcare</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the success and rapid growth in landcare and the commitment by the Australian community to the landcare ethos, this government believes that more urgent action is needed. It is now well accepted that we must move away from an awareness raising phase to on-ground action. Australia has a strong public interest in supporting farmers to take practical action. In return, the community must see changes in farming practices to ensure its investment has lasting environmental benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This government is committed to significantly increased funding for the national landcare program. The additional funding will provide much needed support for implementation of plans, based on a catchment and regional approach. Substantially increased support will also be provided for the develop ment of community initiated and managed projects on public and private land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, funding for property management planning will be provided under the rural adjustment scheme in recognition that farmers need to integrate the management of their natural resources with farm business planning. These measures will be reinforced by the provision of income tax rebate and credits for qualifying landcare works on private land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recognising the importance of dealing with weeds and feral pests as part of the overall natural resource management task, additional funding will also be provided for a national feral animal control strategy and for the implementation of the national weeds strategy. In order to ensure that our limited resources are used wisely and are focused on strategic priorities, the trust will fund a national land and water resources audit. This audit will provide the first ever comprehensive appraisal of the extent of land and water degradation in Australia and its environmental, social and economic costs to the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will incorporate an assessment of water resources to determine the extent of the resource as a step towards achieving a balance in water supply and use. Critically, it will provide essential information on the state of Australia's natural resources to underpin better decision making for natural resource management in the future.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">5. Coasts and clean seas </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's coastal zone supports about 86 per cent of our population and much of our commercial and industrial activity. In addition, our exclusive economic zone represents some 11 million square kilometres of marine waters and their resources. Clearly, the ecologically sustainable management of our coasts and oceans is integral to our way of life and economic prosperity. The trust will therefore fund a coasts and clean seas initiative, to tackle coastal pollution hot spots and threats to Australia's coastal water quality and marine biodiversity. We will focus on previously neglected areas of policy, such as ocean outfalls, stormwater pollution, and marine research. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 is the first instalment in a package of legislation which will replace  Australia's main tax law, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The existing act has grown in haphazard fashion over the past 60 years. Layer upon layer of new provisions have been added with no serious attempt to ensure that the act remains understandable, intelligible or internally consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has grown enormously in length and complexity. Over the last 13 years of the former Labor government alone the size of the ITAA trebled from about 1,100 pages to around 3,300 pages. The cost of compliance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2285"> with the act has grown commensurately. Not even the most expert of tax practitioners can claim to fully understand all aspects of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complexity of the current act has been responsible for a significant erosion of certainty and of confidence in our taxation system, by the general taxpaying community, both individuals and companies. This is damaging to the system itself. It can also weaken the essential tax morality of otherwise honest, law abiding, responsible citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has as a high priority the objective to rewrite the tax laws to:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reduce their length</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reduce their complexity</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> increase their certainty and consistency</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reduce compliance costs</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provide a better environment for business and individual taxpayers to meet their obligations</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This priority is part of a wider commitment by the government to attack unnecessary red tape, overregulation, complexity and uncertainly wherever it exists. The government is committed to reducing the cost of doing business, to increasing national productivity and competitiveness&mdash;to adopt world best practice wherever possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package of bills I am introducing today&mdash;of which the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 is the centrepiece&mdash;is a major first step in the achievement of the government's tax law objectives. The bill is essentially the product of the tax law improvement project. In late 1993 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the income tax law be rewritten. It recommended setting up a broadly based task force to undertake the task. As a result, the previous government in 1994 established the tax law improvement project for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax law improvement project has undertaken extensive public consultation in the preparation of the bills before the House, including the release of draft bills for public comment. The project has also been advised by a consultative committee of experts in the field of taxation. Work is well advanced in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rewriting much of the remaining rules that affect how much income tax a person must pay. A discussion paper outlining a proposed structure for a rewrite of the capitals gains tax provisions has been released and an exposure draft rewrite of the depreciation rules is imminent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Future instalments of the new law will progressively build up the new assessment act. This package of bills makes a significant inroad into that work. The government intends that this first instalment should apply from the 1996&hyphen;97 income year, subject to transitional arrangements for some measures. The practical rule changes made in it are overwhelmingly favourable to those it affects. Future rewritten instalments, essentially on an annual basis, can be expected to apply in similar fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government proposes that the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, which has had a longstanding interest in the tax law and has kept a watching brief over this project in particular, should have the opportunity to complete a review it undertook of an earlier version of this legislation. The government proposes to ask the committee to consider the bill and to report on it at the commencement of the budget sittings in August. I will formally propose this course in a few moments. I now turn to outline some of the specific features of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">GENERAL FEATURES</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a broad level, a number of strategies have been adopted to make the law easier to understand and use.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Core provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important general provisions of the law, those dealing with how much tax a person must pay, have been redrafted in simpler and clearer terms and brought together at the start of the new law. These core provisions are essential to an understanding of the income tax system. They have been expressed clearly but with minimal change to the language of central income and deduction rules in order to retain the value of established judicial precedent.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Better structure</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Readers will be assisted by a more logical structure to the law. The new act will use a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2286"> top&hyphen;down approach, starting with the core and moving on to general provisions which affect large numbers of people; then to more specialised provisions that apply to specific groups of taxpayers or to special types of tax. After that come provisions about collection of recovery of tax and then those about administrative matters. The act will finally contain a dictionary where readers will have easy reference to the meanings of defined terms and concepts used throughout the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">New numbering system</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a new section numbering system that is simple to understand and will better cope with the addition of new material in future. The existing system is cumbersome, confusing and disorienting to readers. It has been a source of derision.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Talking directly to readers</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The practice of addressing readers in the second person, which was introduced in the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Act 1995, has been continued for areas where the law affects individual taxpayers. This engages readers much more actively and promotes understanding. It is not used, however, in provisions that apply only to impersonal entities.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reader Guides</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Important parts of the law begin with orientation material to help readers find their way to what they need to know about it. This material will have a strictly limited legal status in interpreting the new law. The text makes clear distinctions between these non&hyphen;operative guides and the operative rules.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Modern design</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill incorporates modern design techniques for clear and effective communication. It makes extensive use of examples and diagrams, of notes highlighting special features of the law and of signposting to other parts of the law that the reader may need to go to.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">SPECIFIC AREAS OF THE LAW REWRITTEN</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the core concepts, some other areas of the existing law have been rewritten and are included in the bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Losses</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions dealing with deductions for current and prior year losses and company group loss transfers have been rewritten. This has reduced the length of the existing provisions by more than half. Unnecessarily complex and prescriptive rules have been simplified. Another feature is the bringing together of common themes such as the continuity of beneficial ownership and the same business tests of the losses provisions. Redundant provisions have been eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mining</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also rewritten are the capital expenditure write&hyphen;offs regimes for the petroleum mining, general mining and quarrying industries. This has helped reduce the size and complexity of the law and a substantial amount of duplication has been eliminated, reducing the length of the relevant provisions overall by some 70 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Buildings</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The capital expenditure write&hyphen;offs for buildings have been rewritten and, again using the various simplification techniques I have described, have allowed the length of these provisions to be halved.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Substantiation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The income tax rules for calculating car expenses and substantiating work expenses, which were rewritten and enacted last year, are also being transferred across to the new act by this bill. The new law will operate prospectively and existing rulings and court based interpretation will not be affected where the new law re&hyphen;expresses the same ideas for clearer effect, which is mostly what the new law will do. Where a change in substance is being made to the existing law, those changes will only apply for the future. In these cases existing rulings and precedents will apply up to the time the new law begins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The revenue impact of the new law will be mainly neutral. While most changes will have no direct impact on the revenue outcomes, some will result in minor but unquantifiable revenue costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two proposals that will have a measurable revenue impact. A proposal to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2287"> allow accelerated write&hyphen;off for mining expenditure incurred before July 1982 will initially be revenue positive, being $10 million and $5 million in the first two full years respectively, but will become revenue negative in later years. A proposal to allow display homes to be written off under the special concessions for buildings will have an annual cost of $2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I present the explanatory memorandum, which includes a more detailed explanation of the new structure of the bill and of a number of relatively minor changes to the law itself. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The government does not accept this request for an amendment, which, if it were acceded to, would have the effect of appropriating for the purposes of the Housing Assistance Bill 1996 an amount of $1,067,863,000 in each of the financial years 1997&hyphen;98 and 1998&hyphen;99. As I told the House when this matter was last before us, the bill demonstrates the government's commitment to a continuing partnership with the states for the provision of housing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I remind honourable members that, despite the fact that the government's Commission of Audit is yet to report, this bill provides for funding in relation to the 1996-97 financial year at a level that maintains current funding. The government believes that the level of funding outlined by the bill is entirely appro priate with the process of negotiating broader terms and the reforms of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The Commonwealth-state housing agreement is made for a period of up to three years. Any further decision about funding will be made in the context of the progress of the reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the certainty issue, I advise the House that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) last night informed the Senate that the government will be providing the states with a more detailed statement of the government's intention on longer term housing reforms in August, after which the states will have a better understanding of what the government proposes. This will include information on the transition of new arrangements and will assist the states and territories in planning housing programs beyond 1996-97.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we said in the debate earlier in the House on the Housing Assistance Bill, as a result of the government's attitude we are giving no security to the states and, more importantly, no security to public housing tenants. As the New South Wales government has made clear publicly, they have had indicated to them that the federal proposals certainly do indicate over the next three years a loss of $450 million in housing investment in New South Wales alone. What that means in New South Wales is that nearly 3,000 proposed houses will not be built. It also means that rents will have to go up if this government does not keep its commitment to public housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government truly wishes to keep its commitment to public housing and to keep public tenant rents to 25 per cent of income and no more, which is a commitment it made during the pre&hyphen;election period, it should agree to this request from the Senate to extend the one year of funding that it is providing in this bill to three years. Otherwise, in my view, the government is admitting that it will not be maintaining its spending on public housing. No-one in public housing would want to get a further offer of funding after the August budget, when they know that there will be huge cuts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2289">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that the government recognises that the housing sector requires long-term planning. We can see that this was recognised in the report from the Council of Australian Governments meeting last week, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth acknowledged that state public housing capital works programs involve long lead times and, therefore, any date for the discontinuation of Commonwealth capital grants and detailed transitional arrangements, including carryover of funding, need to be settled well in advance of the actual switch in Commonwealth funding from capital to recurrent.</PARA>
<PARA>The government has recognised that this area requires long-term planning, yet it refuses to accede to a request  from the Senate to meet the long-term capital requirements of the states. The implications of this are very serious not just for the states but, more importantly, as I said before, for public housing tenants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) also recognised this in the Senate yesterday, where she too said that she recognised the long lead times for capital funding and the problems of the carryover of funds. She also recognised that payments could be delayed because no agreements have yet been signed by the states. I need to make it very clear to the House that we do not seek to delay this bill. We are seeking to provide some certainty to public housing tenants and the states so that they will not be subject to major cuts in this very important social policy area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are compelling arguments in favour of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. The Industrial Relations Commission will also oversee the simplification of awards to 18 allowable matters, including pay, leave and other important conditions. I assume those opposite will support this measure, given Labor's March 1993 promise and further promises in the Working Nation statement to simplify awards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike Labor, we have no keeper like the ACTU which, to use the words of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) from earlier today, was `a triumph of narrow interest ridden politics over good policy' to prevent us from seeking to implement our promise so overwhelmingly endorsed at the 2 March election .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened with interest to the somewhat animated member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who trotted out another dose of the statistical gymnastics that his former Labor government turned into an art form. He suggested that everything is rosy just the way it is. Regardless of how he claims things are travelling now, or how the remnants of the last Labor government want to trump up their self&hyphen;proclaimed successes, there is no doubt that things could be better, particularly for those without a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember the outcry when the former Prime Minister said, `Things are as good as they get.' The claim did not ring true with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians: it was at odds with their reality. Real people know that job opportunities are being forgone because of the current system, which actively discourages employment. Employers and employees know and voted for sensible change with appropriate checks and balances. This support is returned in the bill we have before the House today. We are giving employees a choice as to whether they stay in an award, as some opt to at present, or choose to sign an agreement that must contain minimum conditions that ensure that the employees get at least as much pay as they would have under the award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If employers and employees agree, the bill allows them to shift from federal awards to either workplace agreements or individual agreements under state systems. As the options for such agreements are wide, reflecting the different sizes, structures and complexions of Australian workplaces, I think all businesses can be better accommodated. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) sang the praises of certified agreements between BHP and a number of unions. This bill maintains provisions for certified agreements and simplifies the process. The Big Australian can still have certified agreements, but not every workplace in his electorate is like BHP. In Dunkley, a new BHP sized employer would be terrific and would do a lot to give many of the more than 10,000 local people registered as unemployed real hope of a job for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the chances of a number of large employers of Boeing proportions setting up in Dunkley are not strong. Instead of a single new large employer creating 1,000 to 2,000 new jobs in Dunkley, our community understands that we need 1,000 to 2,000 single new jobs in many of our 8,000 small businesses. Certified agreements are not what many small businesses want. They want options that accommodate their particular situation. Employees want the opportunity for higher pay for higher productivity. That is what the bill provides. We are also positively discriminating in favour of young people giving junior workers protection against discrimination based on age.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2291">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With around a third of Frankston's job vacancies that are notified to the CES being in the wholesale and retail sector, a major employer of young people, we have to recognise that young people must have a real chance to get a job, not be forced out of a job opportunity by a notion that there should be no recognition of training, of a structured learning curve or of an opportunity to develop their competency and productivity before commanding the same wages as more experienced work force colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will also be restoring a proper balance. We have given our moves the name `A fair go for all', and they will restore some sanity to what under Labor had become very unfair unfair dismissal provisions. We will cap the maximum award for an unfair dismissal to six months salary to a maximum of $30,000 to reduce the incidence of greedy lawyers encouraging people to go on fishing expeditions even if they have actually lost their job for misconduct, criminal activity or other eminently reasonable grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you talk of sensible changes as I just have, there is no change that is more needed than to alter the unfair unfair dismissal laws. One of the chief concerns of the small and micro business community in my electorate is the difficulty that Labor has created for them when they are faced with the need to terminate an employee whose work performance is unsatisfactory. Labor thought that small business was unimportant and went to the recent federal election without a proper small business policy. But Labor was even more dangerous than that. They forgot that business grows jobs, not the other way around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Labor's haste to supposedly protect workers from pitchfork wielding, demonic employers, they hurt the vast majority of the work force. Let me explain why. When you have so&hyphen;called unfair dismissal cases that reinstate workers who have been caught smoking marijuana at work or who are awarded $7,000 by the IRC after they were caught stealing, the whole community has a problem. It is called a small section of the work force actually cheating on their mates with anti&hyphen;job behaviour making everyone's job less secure <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the company that has to reinstate workers or pay compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you catch an employee in the act of stealing and then have to give them three written warnings before you can dismiss them, there is plainly something wrong. Let us look at some of the local examples in my electorate. The Frankston International Motel is run by the Walshes, a very honourable and decent couple who have come out of the teaching profession. As a matter of principle, they give young people, those that really need it, a break. One of the young people they engaged and were training in their industry had been caught thieving, taking exhibits from people who were holding conferences there. There were a number of other issues, including the person's girlfriend spending some time at the location and his getting involved in some marijuana deals. An unfair dismissal claim was lodged against the Walshes when they fired this person. In the end, they were faced with the option of going to court and facing $3,000 to $4,000 in costs or, as the employer said, settling for a $750 payout. You can understand why the Walshes feel somewhat victimised and they will think twice about taking a chance on a young person who really needs a break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a local not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit nursing home in my electorate, that provides the sort of sanctuary and security that many old people are looking for. One of the female employees returned to the workplace some time after being out on a fairly happy and joyous occasion that was reflected in her blood alcohol content. She came in and started dragging some of the people in the home out of their beds and insisting that they have a shower at three or four o'clock in the morning. The same thing occurred. The person was dismissed and the not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit organisation was hauled up before the Industrial Relations Commission and forced to pay several thousand dollars for a wrong that was not their fault.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A local distributor of paint and industrial products who employs 16 people is also faced with a claim for unfair dismissal. It has not been finalised as yet so I will not get into the details. Needless to say, the proprietor is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2292"> starting to wonder why they continue working under such stress for no real gain. When the suggestion was raised by Senator Cheryl Kernot that the Democrats would reject the unfair dismissal provisions, this person thought that he would do something about it, and rang her office. Upon his ringing her office and explaining that he was an employer with 16 jobs that were badly needed in our electorate and explaining the situation, I am advised that a staff member from Senator Kernot's office said, `Have you considered selling the business and letting someone else do it if you can't stand the pace?' This is exactly the sort of attitude that I would have thought no political party should have. These small businesses are the lifeblood of our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These local experiences have produced employers that are substantially out of pocket, more cautious about employing people and less likely to take a chance with a young person who needs a break. The care and sanctuary of elderly people who place their trust in carers has also been destroyed. These are the consequences of Labor's unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill rejects the prehistoric notion that employers can treat the workforce like cattle and that unions can treat their membership like mindless compliant sheep. We will not let unions automatically go into workplaces where they have not been invited, nor will they be able to intervene in wage hearings that are strictly between non&hyphen;unionised staff and their employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also introducing new right to strike provisions for employees, along with the right of employers to lock out workers during negotiation over an Australian workplace agreement. This is because the coalition government wants the labour market to operate like a proper market, where when you are making a deal you can make a tactical retreat, but once an agreement is arrived at the deal is done and the parties have their obligations and should be committed to the deal and know what is involved in making it work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Under Labor there were clear winners and losers over the past 13 years. The best exam ple of a winner was the trade union official. I guess that I was a winner from the past 13 years of Labor, too. The experience that so many in my electorate had helped them to decide that it was time for a change and they removed the former Labor member for Dunkley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Dr Thomas Bramble, from the University of Queensland, pointed out last September, trade union officials are three times more likely than any other Australian to earn more than $40,000 per year. Just as appalling is that the new member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and his senior colleagues with whom he recently worked at the ACTU, Jennie George, Bill Kelty and Tim Pallas, have a combined total of approximately six years work experience outside the trade union movement. This backs up Dr Bramble's opinion that decision making processes in trade unions have steadily shifted away from the rank and file to unelected organisers and industrial officers who do not understand that a successful business is what is needed for secure, productive and rewarding employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clear losers are working Australians and their unemployed brothers and sisters. Shamefully, the OECD found in 1993 that what it called `the market slack'&mdash;their term for the real total level of unemployment&mdash;had risen to a high of 15.5 per cent. It is probably up around 12 or 13 per cent now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is doing is pretty straightforward. We are not cutting wages or turning Australia into a low wage country, or a low skilled country, as the accord did its best to do when Labor was in power. We are not cutting conditions to the bone because employees who opt to go into workplace agreements must receive at least a range of minimum conditions. The government is not destroying what should be increasing cooperation between employers and staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it interesting that the union movement is willing to offer cheap home loans to its members and so compete against Australia's banks and other organisations, like Aussie Home Loans. In doing that, the ACTU is saying, `Yes, we can both service our members and make a profit for our own good and that of our members along the way.' The labour <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2293"> market is a market just like the home loan market: both are competitive; both have buyers and sellers&mdash;one of money, the other of skills. Yet when it comes to the labour market, the ACTU and most of its affiliates steadily turn away and say that the only way the labour market can function is if unions have a monopoly. It is quite simply not the case, and the proposition that we have put before the parliament is that those unions that get off their backsides and provide service to their members will look forward to quite a prosperous future; those who do not will probably find something else to do with their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Good unions and employee associations will continue to play a role in industrial relations. Unions must never forget their members' jobs must be protected, but not in the negative way by calling strikes and go&hyphen;slows. Rather, the best way workers' jobs can survive and blossom and new jobs can be created is for bargaining agents such as unions to work with employers and their individual members. That is the best for everybody's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the Democrats and other minor parties in the other place give their full support to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, and I commend the bill to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been a very interesting debate, and I have had the opportunity to listen to some speeches from those on this side and the other side. There are a couple of points we have to keep in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, not all right or all wrong is on one side or the other. Hearing some of the speakers here, you would think that all the wrong was on one side or the other. Really, it is interesting to listen to some of the government members speak. I think it was the honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) who talked about how many people on this side had not actually worked with their hands. Well, have a look at my hands. I have actually worked with my hands. I have worked in sawmills and I have worked in mines. They were not university jobs, either; they were jobs when I had no other job. That was my full&hyphen;time work. So let us have none <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of this nonsense suggesting that no&hyphen;one on this side has actually worked with their hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would like to make is that it seems to me, given what the government is saying, that there is a great lack of communication about trade unions, trade union officials and what they are trying to do. I represent Port Kembla, which has got some sort of a reputation&mdash;unjustified, I might say&mdash;about industrial relations. I remember we were working there with the Port Kembla harbour task force and there was a gap between the trade unionists, the farmers and the Eugowra area of the west. What they did&mdash;very wisely, I thought&mdash;was get them together. The trade union officials from Port Kembla went out&mdash;not once, but over a year or so&mdash;and stayed with the farmers at Eugowra. They better appreciated their problems, how important it was to get stuff to the market and everything like that. The trade unionists actually appreciated the problems of the farmers. Equally, the farmers came down and stayed at Port Kembla with the trade unionists. They then appreciated the problems, the fears and the concerns that the trade unionists had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all humility, I suggest to some of my colleagues on the other side that perhaps if they actually talked to a few trade union officials&mdash;actually talked to them, outside a confrontationist situation&mdash;they would not find them all to have horns coming out of their heads and things like that. Trade unionists are not always right, but neither are those on the other side always right. I think that if we had a little bit more communication between the two groups we would not get some of the nonsense that has been spoken here during this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation turns on its head a century of industrial relations practice in Australia. It puts the independent umpire role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission into mothballs. It places the award system into the deep freeze. It attacks a right of workers to organise and collectively bargain. It is a savage attack on the right of workers to be represented in negotiations and disputes by a trade union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor strongly opposes any attempt by this government to undermine these key pillars of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2294"> industrial relations, the pillars which have advanced and protected the wages and conditions of all workers during this last century. The government, and particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), have championed his vision of industrial relations change over the last decade. This legislation, to give credit where it is due, is a tribute to the Prime Minister's stubborn, ideological zeal to destroy the Australian trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think many on the other side also have that ideological zeal and want to destroy the Australian trade union movement. The government's view of the employer&hyphen;worker relationship has never been modernised. It still proudly retains the view that workers are just like any other business input and the relationship is like entering into any other form of contract. That fact is that this relationship is much more complex, because it is about living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The relationship centres on workers being able to put food on the table each day, being able to pay the mortgage and give their kids a decent education, and being able to feel at the end of their shift that they have actually contributed something of value to their workplace and, indeed, their lives. This is essentially the basis of the worker perspective in this whole relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government likes to parade the view that there are two equal partners in this relationship. Why is it that the government members are the only people in Australia who seem to think that this relationship is equal? This is the reason trade unions exist. It is the reason these workers' organisations emerged. It is the reason that trade unions have a strong membership and it is the reason they are involved in negotiations on behalf of their members: they do so because equality in the employer&hyphen;worker relationship is nothing short of a fairy tale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the last election, the Prime Minister gave workers a so&hyphen;called rock solid guarantee. At the last election, I produced and distributed a special pamphlet dealing with industrial relations. I told the workers in my area, the Illawarra, not to believe that line. Each member will recall that line. Let me assure the government that Labor intends to hold the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government to that promise. If it is broken, as it will be, no Australian is going to be allowed to forget it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Early last month, the first group of workers to get a taste of this rock solid guarantee were building and construction workers. Building workers, you will recall, went out on the grass for half a day to protest this decision by the Treasurer to tax building workers' travel allowances. This measure, announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in a media release on 2 May, will cost building and construction workers about $20 a week in their take&hyphen;home pay and, worse, they face a hefty tax slug because this decision is retrospective to July of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an example of the Prime Minister's rock solid guarantee that no worker will be worse off under his government: building and construction workers lose $20 a week, or $1,020 a year, from their take&hyphen;home pay, plus a tax bill for up to $1,000. It should be apparent to all Australian workers that the rock solid guarantee is about as solid as quicksand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly interested in the Treasurer's answer during question time on the day the construction workers protested his decision. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me make it entirely clear that this government does not support the policy of introducing new legislation to exempt a privileged minority of the work force from taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing better sums up the attitude of this government to workers. In the words of the Treasurer, they are a `privileged minority'. The fact that this tax exemption on building and construction workers' travel allowances was in their award does not register. Frankly, the government had an ideal opportunity to give substance to its rock solid guarantee by following through with the previous Labor government's decision to introduce legislation exempting construction workers from a tax on their travel allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is set to see many more rallies and protest meetings as the government's ideological agenda is exposed and these pious election statements are tested. I suspect that the Prime Minister is beginning to reconsider his decision to centre his prime ministerial <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2295"> operations in Phillip Street, Sydney, because the streets of the Sydney central business district will be inoperative for most days of the week to cater for rallies and protest meetings which should obviate a visit to the Prime Minister's office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is a double whammy. The government will not only reduce workers' wages and conditions in the same vein as Premiers Kennett and Court, but it will also attack unmercifully the institutions which underpin wages and conditions. The Prime Minister is famous for a remark he made a couple of years ago&mdash;that he was going to stab the commission in the stomach. The proprieties of this place prevent me from saying much more about the Prime Minister's intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unbelievable that this bill permits state enterprise agreements to override federal awards. This means that employees in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania employed under a federal award may be required to sign state enterprise agreements under which their wages and conditions are substantially reduced. Federal award covered employees may have been able to escape Kennett and Court in the past, but this legislation allows them to be grabbed back and stuffed into the state enterprise agreement crockpot that operates in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania. By allowing the federal award to be overridden, workers will be clearly worse off. Is it not ironic that the minimum standards set down in the Victorian, Tasmanian and Western Australian jurisdictions are substantially less than the federal award provisions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am totally opposed to the reduction in the role and power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as outlined in the bill. It is outrageous to see that at least 36 powers and functions presently possessed by the commission are to be removed or limited under the government's proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is shamelessly gutting the commission in the areas of award making and variation; certified agreements; reviewing enterprise or workplace agreements; preference agreements; its relationship with state tribunals, awards and agreements; industrial <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> action; strike pay; demarcation disputes; secondary boycotts; the making of minimum entitlement orders; unfair dismissals; independent contractors; and other organisational arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in the public interest that the commission has jurisdiction to conciliate and arbitrate all disputes which may arise in the workplace, irrespective of their subject matter. Under the government's proposals, workers will be forced to go cap in hand to the boss about any non&hyphen;prescribed employment matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of concern relates to paid rates awards. These awards specify actual paid entitlements rather than the minimum entitlements and where the award is the maximum and not subject to over&hyphen;award bargaining or individual contract bargaining. Paid rates awards should be allowed where the employer and employee desire. If the government believes in its own words about freedom of choice it should be consistent and reflect this in the legislation. Paid rates awards should also be allowed where collective bargaining is not desirable. These awards are important to teachers, nurses, emergency workers and public servants, to name a few. Without paid rates awards these workers will be forced to bargain at the workplace for real wage increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can you imagine for a moment the industrial chaos that the government is inviting? Is it desirable for a teacher to march into the principal's office at a local school and set about negotiating a wage increase? What happens when the principal says no? Are we going to see the teacher's class close down for the day as the industrial tactics begin? Are we going to see other teachers in neighbouring classes go out in sympathy? This is a crazy position that the government proposes to bring about if this determination to convert all paid rates awards to minimum rates is accepted. The government is inviting industrial chaos in education, health, emergency services and the Public Service by pursuing this proposal. It should reconsider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am appalled that the Australian workplace agreements will lack the independent review of the commission before the agreement becomes operational and enforceable. It will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2296"> be a secret document not open to public scrutiny. This is the central plank in the government's industrial relations agenda and it wants to keep these agreements a secret. The question is: why? The answer, of course, is that the wages and conditions of the employee will be eroded. It is that simple. Nobody will be able to do anything about this erosion because the agreement will be secret, the commission will be unable to review it and the workers cannot until they actually complain about the arrangement. Labor will be moving amendments requiring AWAs to be open to public scrutiny, to be reviewed by the commission before having any effect and with the unions having the right to be heard in the process. This is a commonsense approach and it should be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All workers will be hit by this bill, but none more so than young people. Every so often we hear complaints about young people being more ready to collect unemployment benefits than actually work. Who can blame them for having this attitude if they are going to be paid so miserly a wage? The bill provides for employers to pay workers for the time they are on the job being `productive'. It means that young people can be made to work a full week but only receive pay for two, three or maybe four days. On top of this they will be subject to a training discount. It sounds like a deal at the local checkout. It would all be laughable if it were not so serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people's pay will be cut twice&mdash;first for their age and then for their training. In practical terms, it means that a 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;old shop assistant, who will be subject to a 50 per cent training discount on their junior wage, could receive as little as $100 per week. A 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;old working in the textile industry with a 50 per cent training discount on their junior wage could receive just $97 per week. This has a spiralling effect on workers of all ages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that young people should be paid for what they can do rather than how old they are. Cutting young people's wages is not the answer to cutting youth unemployment. It has always been fashionable to blindly attack the trade union movement and blame workers for every real or imagined industrial relations <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problem. It has always been easy, and sometimes very convenient, to make unions the scapegoats. Frequently such attacks are without foundation and ignore the reality of the situation. I do not claim that in each dispute unions are always right but, contrary to the views of the government, neither are they always wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trade union movement in the Illawarra is largely made up of responsible members and officials. They care not only for their wages and conditions but also for the state of the economy and the wellbeing of Australians, particularly the disadvantaged and the battlers. The trade union movement in the Illawarra, under the leadership of the South Coast Labour Council, has had a long tradition of being active in a whole range of worker related issues that extend well beyond the customary role of just seeking better wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my experience, given my close working relationship with the Illawarra unions&mdash;and I still hold a union ticket&mdash;that the officials and members are prepared to negotiate with any party before considering industrial action. I think this would be true of any area. The unions in the Illawarra see strike action as a last resort to be used only after all other avenues have been exhausted. The Illawarra unions have taken a leadership role to develop structures and approaches which facilitate better worker and employer communication and shared decision making. The result has been reduced industrial disputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my area in recent years, we have completed a number of major projects which have benefited the national and regional economy and restored our image as a competent and competitive area. The Illawarra constructed the Sydney Harbour Tunnel at Port Kembla, in the very heart of my electorate, under a flexible enterprise agreement, with only 1&half; days lost to an industrial dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The West Tuna Oil project commenced on 16 April 1993 under an enterprise agreement including unions, ESSO and BHP. The project is continuing, and due to finish shortly, but there is a detailed agreement in place to ensure the completion of this project. The only dispute to have occurred on the site was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2297"> a 24&hyphen;hour stoppage due to management failing to pass on to the site workers its knowledge of a bomb threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, we had the dedication of the No. 6 BHP blast furnace. Again, this project was finished on time, on budget and within a very flexible and receptive enterprise agreement. In fact, the AWU&hyphen;FIMEE Port Kembla branch secretary, Graham Roberts, officially dedicated the blast furnace. A trade union official performing this task would have been unheard of years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The negative image the Illawarra has had to shoulder for many years has finally been broken because of the way these major projects have been undertaken and completed. It is a direct tribute to the Illawarra trade unions, their officials and, most importantly, their members. The Illawarra unions and their members are not prepared to sacrifice hard&hyphen;won wages and conditions. My region has a very strong and proud tradition of standing up for its rights. It is only the most prejudiced people who cannot seem to distinguish between what they perceive as pigheadedness and legitimate trade union militancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of the trade union movement is one of a long, hard fight to achieve the wages and conditions that Australian workers enjoy today. In my region, we understand that the price of maintaining decent wages and conditions is that we must be eternally vigilant. It is why this government, threatened as it is by trade unions, has introduced restrictions on union rights of entry into workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill hinders, at every possible opportunity, the ability of trade unionists to effectively represent their members. Workers who will suffer will be women, migrants and young people. I am pleased that the Senate has already agreed to refer this bill to a committee for inquiry. I am encouraging many organisations and individuals in my electorate to lodge submissions with the committee, to ensure that the flaws in this legislation are exposed. It will be interesting to read the final report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no hiding from the fact that this legislation represents nothing more than an ideological drive by this government to fulfil its longstanding objective of breaking <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the back of the institutions which underpin the wages and conditions of all workers. Make no mistake: this legislation is a blatant attempt to unleash the superior bargaining power of employers. They do not have this power because of the commission, the award system and the right of workers to organise and collectively bargain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians may have been fooled by the government's promises during the election. They may have accepted the cuddly, soft and warm approach adopted by coalition tacticians, but the gloss of this government and its commitments is fading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor movement in the Illawarra will not accept this legislation. We lead the community. We have the interests of our region and the people in it at heart at all times. Those of us who have a background in the trade union movement will not stand back and allow this government a free ride in implementing its ideological agenda. In its opposition to this legislation, the closure of departmental offices, the slashing of jobs, the cutbacks in funding for employment programs and the gutting of the public sector, my region will be legitimately militant, with no apology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, I think that this is very frightening legislation. It is turning many years of industrial relations on its head. It is legislation that should be opposed and will be opposed, especially on this side of the House.  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The introduction in this House of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill at long last heralds hope for a new era in industrial relations in this country. The reforms which will flow from this legislation are set to deliver simpler awards, greater market flexibility and competitiveness, and more direct cooperative employer and employee relationships. This, along with the long overdue changes to the unfair dismissal arrangements, will allow employers to take on additional employees, particularly in the small business sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The foundations upon which these reforms are based are fairness, flexibility and choice. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2298"> We are reforming the system where workers have to agree with terms and conditions which they have had no say in and where employers frequently have been intimidated into compliance. We do not agree with the patronising presumption that employers and employees are incapable of reaching mutually beneficial agreements without union intervention. We are giving workers the option; we are giving them choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reforms replace compulsion with the freedom to decide whether to have a union, or someone else, bargain on your behalf. Releasing workers from the obligation of unionism will shift the focus of the workplace back to where it should be&mdash;to the employer and the employee relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The model of workplace relations that we are replacing has failed to deliver benefits to employees. Recently, a prices surveillance report found that over the past seven years average weekly earnings increased by just 38 per cent while at the same time executive salaries had jumped by 60 per cent. The people meant to be most protected by the ideology and policies of the Labor Party were actually the most neglected, and they have found themselves becoming worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industrial relations platform of the previous Labor government has for many years now only delivered a lower standard of living for Australian workers, with the gap between rich and poor widening with each year of Labor's policies. The defects of the centralised system had become so obvious that even Paul Keating was publicly pushing for reform. Yet falling standards of living for workers is by no means the only problem that we must face as a result of Labor's failure to reform the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this country today we face a devastating problem of youth unemployment. Who among us could have imagined when we were in our teens and early twenties that our children would have to face a youth unemployment figure approaching 30 per cent? Today's school leavers, TAFE and university graduates have inherited a system which gives them the lowest chance in our country's history of being employed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign the coalition made a commitment to address the unacceptable levels of youth unemployment. These reforms are part of delivering on that promise. Part of the solution to having more jobs available for young workers is to create incentives for small business to employ them. Small businesses have struggled over the Labor years, and none more so than those in the rural and regional areas that make up my electorate of McEwen. For too long there have been unnecessary constraints on business that have prevented them from making profits and, in turn, from taking on more workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Smaller rural and regional businesses in particular will benefit from the new unfair dismissal provisions. Business confidence became an oxymoron during the Labor years of intervention and regulation. For too long we put up with unfair dismissal laws that did not allow employers to replace even the most unsatisfactory of workers, including some who actually stole from their employer. The solution by business was to not risk further employment. Employers, desperate to provide more jobs and thereby make their workplaces more efficient and productive, were hamstrung by dismissal laws stacked far too heavily against them. This workplace relations legislation redresses this imbalance with a system that will be fair to both employee and employer. Workplaces will benefit enormously from new provisions which minimise legal costs and discourage frivolous and malicious claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the same reasons, businesses have already applauded this and the other elements of this legislation, which is set to foster a more direct employer&hyphen;employee relationship. This relationship will be characterised by freedom of association. To this end, the government will do everything possible to reduce the intervention of uninvited third parties, whether they be unions, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or employer associations. The point of these new arrangements is to provide choice in the way workplace relations between employee and employer are regulated. This choice is essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In today's economy, managing human resources is the key to competition. Increasing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2299"> numbers of employers have experienced unions as a major impediment to building a direct relationship with their employees, a relationship that should be based on trust and mutual interest. Ultimately, profits are at stake and it is profits that determine the ability of businesses to employ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unions have often been a negative force in employment relations because they have viewed bargaining over workers rights and conditions as a test of strength to be won regardless of the consequences to business or employees. Ambit demands are made and rejected; boycotts and strikes are threatened and held; and compromises and concessions are made before industry restarts and employees return to the routine of work. Such conflict is never good for business. Employees frequently do not achieve any net gain and the reality is that this type of process does absolutely nothing for labour relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The adversarial process of dispute resolution, which results in a breakdown of relations between employer and employee, causes unease and tension which negatively affect the desire to contribute to business profits and reduce the workplace efficiency that would lead to job creation. In stark contrast, the aim of this new legislation is to establish a framework for fair and cooperative workplace relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers and their employees are set to benefit from the new arrangements. For example, the senior staff manager at David Jones in Melbourne has advised my office that they have received nothing but positive feedback from the shop floor. Management, too, is looking forward to the more fruitful and positive relationships engendered by direct discussions with employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a small business setting, such relations are imperative for trust and better working environments. In turn, unions will have, of necessity, to offer a better service to attract members. Thus, the responsibility will be to achieve mutually satisfactory outcomes rather than conflict. Employers, too, will be able to use unions to provide advice and negotiating skills. The brute force of the bargaining war <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of conflict will be replaced by this new legislation which will make it much easier for employers to gain access to the various forms of court penalties in response to unauthorised strikes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new legislation will also remove the `conveniently belong' rule that prevented competition between unions for members. We will then see the end of the days of collectivism, compulsion, monopoly rights and conflict. These measures will develop more co&hyphen;operative workplaces for our young workers of the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, the coalition made a commitment to reduce the level of youth unemployment. In May 1996, 93,800 teenagers aged between 15 and 19 were unemployed and looking for full&hyphen;time work. This translates to a teenage full&hyphen;time unemployment national rate of 27.8 per cent. In some areas of my electorate of McEwen, the figure is as high as 42 per cent. This rate of teenage unemployment has hardly moved since the second half of 1994 when it averaged 28 per cent, even though the Labor government's Working Nation initiatives were in place during this time. Teenagers have not benefited from the jobs growth of the last few years, and part of the problem has been an inflexible system of workplace relations. The reforms put forward by the government are at long last set to give young workers a better chance at finding gainful full&hyphen;time employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill allows for the continuation of traditional junior rates to make sure that there are jobs available for young people, and to give them a fair start in the labour market. Maintaining this approach provides the vital stepping stone between school and a first job. Abolishing junior rates, as would occur under the current legislation in 1997, would risk the jobs of thousands of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has expressed concern and, in fact, has predicted doom and gloom about what might happen when an employee no longer qualifies for a junior rate, that is, that some employers might retrench staff as soon as they had to pay them more. This new legislation, though, prevents the sacking of employees on the basis of their age. There <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2300"> will also be general protection against dismissals which are unfair on other grounds. The added flexibility of workplace contracts is set to deliver more freedom than did past legislation for young workers to enter into competency based arrangements and training schemes. This is combined with the government's modern Australia apprenticeship scheme which will ensure that training is relevant to industry and enterprise needs. If teenage unemployment is going to be reduced from its current high national level, and those even higher levels in McEwen, it is vital that we match training and experience to jobs. This program of reform is vital in that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been deliberate misinformation and scaremongering about this legislation and, in particular, about training wages and how the new legislation will affect those currently in training schemes and those looking for work. People in existing training arrangements will not be affected by the change in legislation. They will continue to work, to train and to be paid the same as they are now. For those looking for work, there will be a greater chance of employment because the whole labour market will be freed up. This policy will enable businesses to give more young people employment while they also enjoy the benefit of a relevant training program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is all about fulfilling the commitment we made to reduce levels of teenage unemployment that are far too high. It is about giving young people a chance to start a career and to take on relevant training to equip them for future employment. Labor persisted for too long with the Working Nation strategy which failed to change the desperate situation that many young Australians face. We are not going to let that continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to address the benefits of this legislation in terms of delivering equal pay, particularly for women. Statistics of average weekly earnings show that women are earning about $120 less per week than men. When the figures are broken down by occupation the facts remain the same: women are paid less. A recent objective skills analysis showed that women were performing work of the same <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> value as men but were being paid considerably less. That means that, at the moment, for equal work, or for work of equal value, women are definitely paid less. So, while Australia ranks second only to Sweden in terms of pay equity, we still have a lot of ground to make up before women achieve parity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ever since the release of proposals for the new workplace reform scheme, there have been claims from the opposition that women will be disadvantaged because of these reforms; that women will lose effective methods of achieving parity; that the reforms will be detrimental to low wage, low&hyphen;skilled workers with poor union representation; that the so&hyphen;called secrecy of workplace contracts will prevent women from giving evidence of discrimination; and that anyone earning more than the basic award minimum would not be able to take an equal pay claim to the IRC. These claims are all misplaced, and they come from an opposition that had 13 years to deliver equal pay for women but failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government is committed to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. There will be strong objects in the act to ensure that anti&hyphen;discriminatory provisions are given effect to. The coalition government will also give effect to international treaties such as the ILO and the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. This treaty includes rights to minimum wages and the right to equal pay for work of equal value, as well as provisions protecting against dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act will also ensure that the IRC, in certifying agreements, takes proper account of its legal obligations under the Sex Discrimination Act. In respect of Australian workplace agreements, this will be a condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That equal pay claims will no longer be taken to the IRC is both natural and sensible. The process should be, and will be, conducted through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This change was suggested four years ago by the then Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Quentin Bryce. The advantages of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission are many. They include the availability of a general <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2301"> inquiry, rather than a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case analysis, which is also available; the availability of damages or compensation for individuals, which is not available from the IRC; and the greater experience of the HREOC in dealing with individual matters of discrimination. Overall, the HREOC is a more practical, flexible and experienced body to deal with matters of discrimination against women in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women will actually be far better off in terms of available legal redress. They will also benefit from the more flexible arrangements that they will be able to make with employers. Instead of being locked into an award with fixed hours, conditions, rates of pay and so on, they will be able to negotiate directly with employers for more suitable hours and conditions. Special provisions have been set out, for instance, for casual workers. Minimum conditions still apply, and include a guarantee of personal or carers leave and parental leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have the Yakka factory in Seymour in my electorate. This clothing factory is currently a closed shop, employing approximately 60 women, and is managed by a woman. This factory fits the stereotype of the sort of workplace that the opposition constantly uses to support its argument that women such as those who work in this clothing factory will not be able to negotiate workplace agreements and will need the expertise of their unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I contacted this factory and asked them whether they had any concerns about the provisions of this legislation. I was emphatically told, `No. We have never had any problems in negotiating with management. We have just got a new canteen and a meeting place that was negotiated.' Did their union achieve this? No; those women did. I was told, in fact, that the only contact these female workers have had with their union in recent times was a letter, sent to each and every one of them by the union, demanding that they not vote for me in the recent election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These workers know from first&hyphen;hand experience that their union did not negotiate on their behalf for improved amenities. These female workers achieved improved working conditions through their own initiative and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relationship they have built with the management over the years. These women are exactly the types of workers that the opposition constantly tells us are incapable of negotiating a workplace agreement. These women are just like so many thousands of other women in the work force, the majority of whom manage families, are effective members of sporting, social, religious and community groups, who may not have formal qualifications but have highly developed organisational, networking and communicating skills, the essential skills needed in any negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objects of this legislation make it quite clear that the coalition government is committed to the development of work practices which allow for a balancing of work and family responsibilities. We will remove the restrictions on regular part&hyphen;time work, which will facilitate the opening up of more flexible working opportunities for women. It is this sort of added flexibility and choice which defines our workplace reforms legislation, and which is set to deliver substantial benefits to all workers and to our national economy, including our rural and regional economies, to give our young unemployed a chance to get started. By taking these measures we will be putting a flexible framework in place where initiative, productivity and efficiency will be rewarded. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The workplace relations bill is designed to do four things: firstly, to allow some employers to reduce the wages and conditions of both currently employed and future workers; secondly, to substantially undermine the bargaining power of workers; thirdly, and related to that, to attack the strength of the vehicle through which that bargaining power is usually exercised, namely, trade unions; and, finally, to substantially diminish the role that is played in the process of industrial bargaining by the independent umpire, the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would know very well, Mr Deputy Speaker, industrial law is complex and cannot be understood simply by reference to its terms alone. It is often the case that what happens in the workplace, what happens on the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2302"> ground, what happens in society at large does not necessarily reflect the literal letter of the law and the impact of the law can only be understood with reference to what actually happens in workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Things which may appear fair on the face of the letter of the law can often be extremely unfair. The classic example of this, of course, is the presumption which is at the heart of the government's position in this legislation, that there is an equal bargaining position between workers and employers, which does happen from time to time but generally is not the case. In most instances there is a very gross inequality of bargaining power. We have seen this view surface on a number of occasions in the debate this afternoon and this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to commence my remarks by referring to the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the election campaign that no worker would be worse off as a result of the Howard government's reforms in the industrial relations area. We in Victoria are pretty used to this sort of promise because Jeff Kennett made the same promise prior to his election victory in 1992, then immediately set about destroying workers' entitlements and ensuring that an awful lot of workers were worse off as a result of his accession to office. I would like to cite a few examples from the legislation to illustrate how the government is going to break the Prime Minister's promise and how workers will be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On unfair dismissals, those workers who are not on federal awards and suffer an inadequate unfair dismissal protection, such as those in Victoria, will lose because they will lose the unfair dismissal protection that they have under the current legislation. Employers who can plead incapacity to pay will get off with a lighter penalty or no penalty at all if they are found to have unfairly dismissed the worker. This is not a principle that I have heard the Liberal Party or the government advocate in other areas. I notice the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) is at the table and I am very interested to know his views as to whether, for example, we should take a capacity to pay approach on things like parking fines or speeding fines and that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> millionaires should be made to pay thousands of dollars for speeding fines that cost ordinary people maybe $150. If justice is to be economically blind then perhaps that is the sort of principle we should adopt. But it is rather amusing that the Liberal Party and the government see fit to adopt it, not for people who are on social security benefits, not for the disadvantaged, not for people who are in poverty, but for employers. Those employers who have got some problems with capacity to pay, when they have been found under the civil law to have wrongfully dismissed somebody, can plead incapacity and can get off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second example of where the commitment will be breached is in the notion that state agreements will be able to override federal awards. There will be many instances where state agreements will be inferior to federal awards. This will provide employers with the opportunity to reduce conditions. It will allow employers to jurisdiction hop, pursue the cheapest deal and use their bargaining power to force workers into the deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that workers currently have some capacity to jurisdiction hop and to go from state jurisdictions to federal awards. But other than by using the mechanism that was developed specifically to preserve an award system&mdash;developed by the previous government in the wake of the Kennett legislation&mdash;this is extremely difficult and can take years. All you have to do is speak to the nurses, the SPSF and health insurance unions to see how difficult that can be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third example is young workers where the abolition of junior rates countenanced by the previous government is going to be reversed. I notice that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) in question time today was saying, `Isn't this terrible. This was part of a general consensus across the two major parties in the 1970s and 1980s.' There were a few other things in that consensus and most of them are being knocked over in this bill. Centralised wage fixing was part of that consensus, as was the supremacy of the Industrial Relations Commission and the ability to arbitrate on all matters in the employment relationship. That is all going so <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2303"> why do you want to keep the bit that suits you and the employers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen that on&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training, as defined by the employer, is now going to be capable of being removed from remuneration so employers will be able to say, `The work that you are doing is training so I will not have to pay you.' The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has indicated that at least there will be a floor on this&mdash;the dole. It will be $3.05 an hour. So we have an improvement on the $3 an hour in 1993 in Jobsback; it is now $3.05 an hour. The suggestion that lowering youth wages is going to create more jobs for young people is facile. It is demand driven. There must be demand in the companies for the work to be done. If the demand is there the work will be done&mdash;and if there is a higher rate of pay, that rate will be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth area in which the commitment by the Prime Minister will be breached is in the notion that awards will now only be able to contain about 18 core themes. Critical issues such as superannuation, where there is still a cloud of uncertainty, and occupational health and safety&mdash;key issues of this nature&mdash;will not be able to be arbitrated upon. More issues will be left up to the free market and, again, the inequality of bargaining power will come into play and workers will lose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth is that the commission will not have the power to arbitrate a minimum or maximum part&hyphen;time hours clause or, indeed, a ratio of part timers to full timers. The Liberal Party and the government do not seem to know where they stand on the issue of part&hyphen;time employment. They are a little bit confused. The Prime Minister in question time a couple of weeks ago told us how wonderful and important part&hyphen;time employment is and how important it is for people, particularly women, to be able to exercise choice and to have different sorts of structures of employment and so on&mdash;and part&hyphen;time work is good. This bill will allow much more part&hyphen;time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, we have the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training fronting up here saying that most of the 730,000 jobs created in the last term of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor government were part&hyphen;time jobs&mdash;and therefore they did not count. Part&hyphen;time jobs do not matter if they are created by a Labor government but if they are in an industrial relations bill designed to make it easier for employers to do what they like then access to part time is extremely important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part&hyphen;time work is a complex issue. There are some workers whose conditions and livelihoods are seriously threatened if the capacity to introduce unlimited part time is put in place&mdash;this includes workers that I have represented&mdash;because it means employers will be able to cherry pick and offer them only part&hyphen;time work in such a way that they will not be able to get other part&hyphen;time jobs doing other things&mdash;for locational, time or other reasons. The end result is that their wages and amount of work go down substantially. But there are lots of other circumstances where part time is worthwhile and important. Our union was part of the reforms seven or eight years ago that greatly expanded the capacity for part time in the area that we covered, which was very substantial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point is the inability of the Industrial Relations Commission to make awards for independent contractors. Ever since the states started to intervene on a legislative basis in the employment relationship, we have had notional independent contractor arrangements emerging to allow employers to exploit workers and get around those sorts of provisions. By precluding the Industrial Relations Commission from being able to arbitrate on those matters, you are simply allowing that to proliferate. We will see these sorts of arrangements emerge in areas where it is clear that there is an employment relationship; for example, in the data processing industry where you will see even worse exploitation emerge as a result of these provisions. These are just the major examples of where workers will be worse off as a result of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot of posturing from the government about how they are now the party of the blue&hyphen;collar workers. One by one, the various groups of blue&hyphen;collar workers have been dropped off. They are not the party of the blue&hyphen;collars workers in the building industry <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2304"> because they are taking away from them the arrangement where their travel allowances are not taxed&mdash;like, I might add, our travel allowances. They are desperately trying to destroy the Australian maritime industry and they hate the MUA so they are not the party of the blue&hyphen;collar workers at sea or on the wharves. They are trying to do the same thing in the meat processing industry as well. So they are not the party of the blue&hyphen;collar workers of the meat industry either. Bit by bit, all this posturing is being revealed for what it is&mdash;pure facade and nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a more general sense, workers will be worse off because of the erosion of bargaining power. This is really central, as I said, to the issue in dispute. To many people on the other side, the contract for labour is simply another contract. In fact, the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) said that it is the same as the contract for a housing loan. But it is not just the contract for a sack of spuds or a bag of smarties; it is the core building block on which our society is constructed. The award system and the Industrial Relations Commission are all about correcting the often massive imbalance in negotiating and bargaining power, and providing a level playing field for workers and employers in which some reasonable degree of social equity can be negotiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This workplace relations bill will substantially weaken the bargaining power of workers. Australian workplace agreements for individual workers weaken bargaining power because workers can be asked to sign these before they get a job. It is not going to be very long before AWAs become a de facto job application. You will be asked to sign an application that says, `I hereby agree to forgo this condition, that condition, this condition and to work in these circumstances.' Existing employees are going to be told, in many areas&mdash;believe me this will happen; it happened under Kennett and it is going to happen under this government&mdash;to take the agreement or take the sack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Core conditions like sick leave will now be tradeable&mdash;they can be cashed out&mdash;as in the Tweed Valley case. That effectively puts workers&mdash;workers who are desperate for a bit of extra disposable income because they are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on an income of $350 a week or thereabouts&mdash;in a position where they will be forced to trade away what are, in reality, insurance conditions in their employment contracts, such as sick leave. Sick leave is there for people who are sick. It is not there to be traded away for dollars. It is there to ensure that workers who are sick are able to leave work, are able to be looked after and are able to get proper medical attention without suffering loss of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the CRA dispute we heard a lot of rhetoric from the other side, from the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Prime Minister, questioning what is so wrong with individuals being able to negotiate their own deals with the boss. What is so terribly wrong with that? Why should they not be able to go out and do their own little private deals? I would ask: what is wrong with predatory pricing? What is wrong with dumping? What is wrong with wholesalers forcing small farmers to compete against each other to lower their prices on the produce that they are providing? What is wrong with large retailers like Coles&hyphen;Myer using their power to squeeze small manufacturers, or oil companies using their power to squeeze independent garage owners out of business? The answer: it is all abuse of market power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what is wrong with individuals negotiating their own contracts in most industrial relations situations. It enables employers with market power to exploit; it enables them to get away with things that they should not get away with. Most employers do not necessarily do that, but there are plenty who do. The employers who do drag the market down force those who do not want to do so into a position where they probably have to, whether they like it or not. This is a recipe for greater inequality and insecurity in our society&mdash;more dog eat dog. We can see it all in the rhetoric that comes from the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New Zealand has been put up as the model. We have heard all about the growth that has occurred in New Zealand. We have not heard about their current account deficit or the low base from which that growth came. We particularly have not heard about the massive <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2305"> increase in wage inequality which the statistics demonstrate for New Zealand from 1991 to 1995. People such as cleaners, clerks, drivers, shop assistants, labourers&mdash;the people who are not often seen in the high profile industrial disputes&mdash;have lost out. They are the people who have lost their penalty rates. They are the people who are in difficulty as a result of that change. That is the sort of thing we do not want to see in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It makes me laugh that the same people who will defend things like statutory marketing arrangements in primary industry that are there to protect the economically weak in their constituency say, `Oh, but it's got to be individually based for workers.' In Australia there are in existence almost 100 statutory marketing schemes for primary products designed primarily to ensure that there is some bargaining power for small producers. You have them for rice in New South Wales, sugar in Queensland, grains in Western Australia, barley in Victoria and South Australia and milk across the country.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever the Hilmer competition agenda is put, whenever it is threatened in this area, they all scream, `No, no. We've got to look after the producers,' but the same logic is not applied to workers. They are not allowed to band together and bargain collectively with some sort of statutory basis for it. But it is okay for the constituencies of the National Party and Liberal Party to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a similar situation with respect to micro&hyphen;economic reform. For example, the Commonwealth provided $165 million, out of $400-odd million, to ensure massive redundancies in the wharves in the late 1980s&hyphen;early 1990s. The average Commonwealth contribution was $37,000 per redundant wharfie. With the aid of the Parliamentary Library, I made a comparison with the rural adjustment scheme. In three years, $273 million of Commonwealth money was provided to allow farmers to move off uneconomical marginal farms. The average assistance per farmer was $31,500&mdash;not far short of the average assistance to the wharfie. When it is wharfies, it is rorts; when it is farmers, it is rights. That is the difference. That is the hypocrisy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is directly related to attacking workers' bargaining power through attacking unions. In regard to the issue of the right of entry, it is going to be almost impossible for unions to get access to workers in workplaces who are not members of unions because, even if there is a single member there, they will be too intimidated, too frightened of being sacked, to do what is required under this legislation, which is to virtually sign in blood that they want the union to come into the workplace. I say to the Attorney-General that I have been in this situation plenty of times, trying to recruit in workplaces. The people in the industry that you are now representing say things like, `You come in. No problems. Come in at six o'clock on Friday and talk to all the workers then.' Of course, they are all well and truly gone by then. The proposed legislation will make it almost impossible to recruit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appointment of an employment advocate is designed to undermine unions. It is designed to create a different model. It will be a bit similar to the failed Industrial Relations Bureau of the Fraser government that we all remember so well. The abolition of the `conveniently belong' provision has been done in a nice sneaky way to favour tame cat unions that will be developed on an enterprise basis so that real unions&mdash;unions that exist now&mdash;will not be able to compete on a level playing field. They will not be able to compete against tame cat unions but it will be able to be used against them. Rules will be required to provide for autonomous enterprise branches. It is the same thing. The government is trying to make sure that it is all turned against unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the disamalgamation provisions. They are now going to allow branches of pre&hyphen;amalgamation unions to disamalgamate. Again, it is not about something that is logical or rational; it is all about trying to set the union movement against each other to undermine workers' bargaining power and to ensure that employers can pick and choose to the greatest degree that they like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unions cannot make a submission to the Industrial Relations Commission about the content of an award unless they can prove <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2306"> that they have got members covered by it. Again, this enables employers to set lower conditions in an area that is not unionised and then, through market forces, allows that to drag down the real value of workers' wages and conditions across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, union ability to enter premises to check time and wages records, which, in reality, has been the means of enforcement of the Industrial Relations Act in the past&mdash;much more so than the Arbitration Inspectorate&mdash;is now unenforceable. Again employers will be able to get away with what they like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot said in this debate by Liberal members about unions and union officials bludging on their members, driving BMWs, not really representing members and earning huge incomes. Let me tell you this: before I came into this place a few years ago I was secretary of a union. I was earning about $39,000 a year. I was in charge of a $2&half; million budget. I had 30 staff under my control and I was working 65 to 70 hours a week. There are not many other parts of society that pay like that for doing that sort of job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are hundreds, indeed thousands, of union officials in this country who work their guts out, who put in long hours and for generally pretty low pay because they believe in what they are doing. Moreover, there are thousands of shop stewards&mdash;most of the union officials who are full&hyphen;time officials  have been shop stewards or involved in an honorary capacity in representing their members&mdash;who also work very hard to ensure that the people they represent get a fair deal. The sort of ignorant and childish rhetoric that we have heard from people like the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) this afternoon indicates how little most people on the other side understand about workplaces, industrial relations and what actually happens there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final thrust of the legislation is to gut the Industrial Relations Commission. The arbitral power will be restricted to 18 core issues and minimum rates. There is no power to review enterprise agreements, no power to ensure equal pay and no power to restrict the ratio of part-timers or to set maximum-minimum hours.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reality, what is happening here is the introduction of the first stage of Jobsback&mdash;it is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It is cleverly crafted to resemble the Liberal's soft rhetoric at the election&mdash;`nobody will be worse off, it will all be soft and cuddly, it will all be okay'. In reality, it is the first of the foundations for Jobsback. As a result of this legislation, we will gradually see more inequality, more unfairness in the workplace, more uncertainty and insecurity for workers who have fewer rights, less power through their collective organisations, and more arbitrary abuse of employer power. The end result will be back to the law of the jungle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the end result will reflect the comments with which I will conclude. The Prime Minister, as the then shadow minister for industrial relations, I think, on 9 July 1992 was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> as saying that, as a result of the then Liberal policy:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">People will be paid according to what their bosses can afford and what their skills are, and it will vary enormously . . . honestly impossible to quantify how much some wages might drop.</PARA>
<PARA>Theoretically, the policy of those opposite might have changed. But in practice this legislation indicates that this is precisely what they are doing&mdash;and that is what will happen in this society. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak in support of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, I feel there is no point in reiterating the points that have been made by so many others. Instead, I will focus on why change is needed on individual contracting, on unfair dismissal provisions and also on youth wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In commencing, I think it is useful to remind all members of the House of the grim situation in which this country finds itself. At the moment we have around 8&half; per cent unemployment. Of course, if you allow for those working part time who would like to work full time, or those who have given up even looking for a job, it is considerably more. We have 60,000 young people who are considered to be long-term unemployed. Our current account deficit is still running at around $2 billion a month. We have interest rates which are amongst the highest in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2307"> industrialised world. We have a manufacturing sector that is struggling to barely survive. We also have a growing divide between those who have wealth and those who do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind the House of one incident which brought me to the parliament, which is pertinent to this debate. During one of my National Press Club addresses in June 1992, I spoke about the health effects of unemployment&mdash;and I would be very happy to remind the House of what I said on that occasion. But when I had finished my address, the then Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Ian Spicer, was asked a question about the employment of young people. He got up and gave a reply that was based on a survey that the chamber had just done of the top 200 employers in Australia. Essentially, he was proposing, on behalf of employers, a change to the way in which youth wages and conditions would be negotiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before Mr Spicer could even get his backside back on his chair, Bill Mansfield, who was then the Vice&hyphen;President of the ACTU, sprang to his feet and said, `Well, absolutely under no circumstances will the union movement of Australia ever talk to employers about anything like that.' That was at a time when we had 34 per cent youth unemployment&mdash;that is, those who were looking for a job&mdash;and 47 per cent youth unemployment in areas like Liverpool in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I then said to the audience, `My God, listen to this; here are the people who create wealth in Australia who could and should employ more Australians telling us what they perceive as the problem, whatever the merits of what they are proposing, and then we have the Labor movement saying, "Oh, no, we're not even going to talk about it".' The previous government could not and perhaps even would not listen to employers due to the de facto cabinet that was comprised of members of the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACTU-government accord, about which we have heard so much in the last few months, needs to be put into some perspective. In the first 10 years of that accord, the number of unemployed people in this country went from 670,000 to 840,000 at a time when <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we averaged 3&half; per cent annual growth. If we are to achieve something like five to 5&half; per cent unemployment by the turn of this century, we need to create something like 250,000 jobs a year to make inroads into the number of people who are unemployed and to soak up new entrants into the labour market. On average, the number of jobs created per year in the first 10 years of that ACTU-government accord was 160,000. It is obvious that what we are doing at the moment is not working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened this morning to the address of the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and that of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). All the figures that those members came out with I have heard before&mdash;as have all the people sitting down this evening to watch Ray Martin and all the people in Sydney who read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS>. There are a few things that I would like those two members and some others on the opposite side to hear from me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995 the Australian National University's economics professor, Bob Gregory, and former Reserve Bank board member, Boyd Hunter, published a statistical analysis of the economic polarisation currently occurring in Australia between the rich and the poor. They found that from 1976 to 1991 the lowest one per cent of neighbourhoods in terms of what statisticians call socioeconomic status, or SES, lost one-third of their employment. The lowest one per cent also lost 23 per cent of their household income, and the rate of male unemployment increased from 6.4 per cent to 28.1 per cent&mdash;and these are the poorest one per cent in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gregory contrasted this with the high SES areas, one of which I have the privilege to represent, where over the same period there has been a marginal fall in employment but where household income has increased 31 per cent. Nationally the employment rate of women in high SES areas now exceeds that of men in low SES areas by more than 10 per cent. This so starkly represents that about which Australians, and young people in particular, are most concerned, and that which is the principal legacy of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2308"> previous government's industrial relations, social and economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year DEET, for example, put out a tender for research on the construction of indicators of self-esteem because we are now so concerned about what seems to be a constant underclass in Australia. People who have known nothing other than poverty and debt, hopelessness, the vast chasm between reality in suburban and regional Australia and the cruel rhetoric of the previous government, have had enough. I think most are anxious that we try a new approach and that we listen to employers as we listen to employees and those in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reforms are absolutely critical to achieving increased productivity and employment growth and improving the pay and living conditions of Australians. If we are going to have any hope we have to do this. The award system becomes a safety net and it sets a minimum rather than a ceiling. It removes the presumption that adversarial disputation is inevitable&mdash;that employers are not to be trusted and that compulsory collectivism provides the greatest return to employees and society generally. The industrial relations system has made a significant contribution to reducing the manufacturing sector's ability to compete on world markets and, along with recurrent expenditure financed on debt, has contributed to our balance of payments problems, our foreign debt crisis and therein higher interest rates for those who are actually trying to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an irony that was not lost on me and about which I would like to remind the House. The previous government passed what was known as the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance) Amendment Bill 1995. That government refused&mdash;and this bill enabled doctors to contract directly with insurance companies and hospitals and hospitals to contract directly with insurance companies&mdash;to allow doctors to appoint an agent or to negotiate as a group. They said that they must negotiate as individuals&mdash;that is, they were not allowed a choice of whether they would negotiate a workplace agreement as individuals or have a union represent them. The previous government said, `No, you have to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> negotiate as individuals.' As far as I am concerned, that is nothing but rank hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are going to do here is give employees a choice&mdash;a choice that the previous government, in a significant piece of legislation, chose to deny a significant part of the Australian work force, albeit the professional end of it. We are going to allow workers to enter into an Australian workplace agreement by either negotiating it privately with an employer or being represented by a union. The groups that are most threatened by these changes are not wage earners but outdated management groups and unions, many of which were listed by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CRA dispute is a classic case in point. The ACTU used the Industrial Relations Commission and Labor's Industrial Relations Act to force its way between the company and its work force. At Bell Bay the company's employment contracts were overturned despite clear support for them by an overwhelming majority of the work force and evidence that they had significantly increased productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the previous government seems to have forgotten is that it is employers who risk personal capital in the business and increasingly with very little or no incentive to do so. Under the present unfair dismissal laws, many small business owners, knowing there is an onus of proof on them to prove that an employee has failed to meet a minimum standard of employment, either will not employ anybody or feel forced to keep an ineffective or incompetent employee because of the emotional and/or financial cost of dismissing that person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small businesses, especially those with a small number of employees, simply do not have the administrative infrastructure to comply with the strict and convoluted procedures required to dismiss an employee. Even when they try to do the right thing, they often inadvertently fall foul of the law. In small businesses, one employee not pulling their weight can wreak havoc, sabotage the business and put other people's jobs at risk.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2309">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current arrangements stop employment. If you talk to people in business and actually listen to them you will find that many could, and they should, employ more Australians but they cannot and they will not. They maximise part&hyphen;time employment. We hear from the other side a lot of nonsense about how we are going to have all this part&hyphen;time employment. Do they realise, for example, that in the last decade the number of people working part&hyphen;time has gone from 13 to 34 per cent? That is under the present arrangements. Employers are doing everything they can to try to avoid unnecessarily burdensome legislation that governs employing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 30 March 1994 to 15 January 1996 the Industrial Relations Court of Australia finalised 16,180 unfair dismissal claims. Some 6.2 per cent were settled by court judgment and 93.8 per cent were resolved by settlement and negotiation or withdrawn. The previous Minister for Industrial Relations said this was an illustration of how well the system was working. In no small way it was due to the inability of small business to fight unfair dismissal claims. Each challenge to a dismissal costs employers time and money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gary Brack, the Executive Director of the Employers Federation of New South Wales, was advising his members to allocate at least two weeks for the hearing and two weeks for preparation. I think it is worth pointing out to the House what was stated in an editorial on this topic in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 28 February 1996. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is needed, whichever party is elected, is a law which provides a proper balance: one which gives honest employees protection from harsh, unjust and unreasonable dismissals while giving no advantage at all to those who refuse to pull their weight.</PARA>
<PARA>On 27 February 1996, an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whoever wins, the best outcome would be for the existing federal unfair dismissal laws to be scrapped. It is better to have nothing at all than the flood of red tape which now exists.</PARA>
<PARA>I will give a simple illustration of how the present system has actually worked against the employment of people who so desperately need jobs. An LPG tanker driver was dismissed after his employer discovered that he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> forgot to mention that he had previously rolled a truck, he fiddled his work hours, he failed to give his name to a motorist whose car he had damaged, he failed to turn up to two disciplinary meetings and was rude and abusive to his employer. The result was that the driver was reinstated and awarded more than $20,000 in compensation. The court acknowledged that he had lied and his attitude left a lot to be desired, but it found the employer was in breach of the legislation. What kind of nonsense is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RW5">Dr NELSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a survey conducted of its members early this year, the Employers Federation of New South Wales documented that complying with the dismissal laws was the No. 1 concern of small and medium sized enterprises. Of the 2,300 businesses canvassed, 89 per cent complained that the federal unfair dismissal laws made it excessively difficult to fire inappropriately performing employees. The two principal problems that drive change in relation to unfair dismissal are the complexity and legalism of the federal system in comparison with the state systems and the more stringent emphasis on procedural fairness by the Industrial Relations Court of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said a few things this afternoon about larger businesses. Recruitment Solutions, a finance industry placement firm, found in its 1995&hyphen;96 annual recruitment and remuneration survey of 500 companies that more than 29 per cent had faced at least one claim in the preceding 12 months and that seven per cent had cancelled or suspended plans to recruit permanent staff as a direct result of unfair dismissal legislation. One in seven had employed more temporary and contract staff as a consequence of the legislation. An upsurge in the number of companies introducing probation periods could also be tracked back to unfair dismissal laws, according to Recruitment Solutions Managing Director, Greg Savage. For the first time, 38 per cent of companies in one year had introduced a probation period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1966 will simplify the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2310"> system. It will protect the rights of employees unfairly dismissed, minimise legal costs, discourage frivolous claims and empower the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to determine whether dismissal is unjust. The changes, of course, will apply only to those under federal awards. The AIRC will be able to award costs, including where a hearing proceeded beyond conciliation to arbitration and where the commission is satisfied that it was unreasonable for a party not to have settled. It will also take into account the capacity of the employer to pay. For goodness sake, what is the point of bankrupting someone in a small or medium business over an unfair dismissal claim if another five or six employees then lose their livelihood? The previous government lost the plot! In terms of BMWs&mdash;which somebody just mentioned&mdash;I will always remember the present member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and his colleague, Mr Kelty, jumping out of a black BMW to go to a negotiation over wages and awards. I think, for many working Australians, that said more than any words said here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, on youth unemployment, junior wage rates are a positive discrimination in favour of young people. I would be the last person to want to exploit anybody&mdash;particularly a young person&mdash;but, again, listen to employers. Why won't they employ young people? It is for all kinds of reasons, but central to it is the concept of people needing to have experience and skills which are commensurate to the rate of pay. There are also the problems of training and paying people for work when they are actually not there because they are out being trained. A survey by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that over 70 per cent regarded junior wage rates as being of large or major importance in their decisions to employ people under 21. Job subsidies, by the way, were considered to be an administrative nightmare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill gives effect to what it is all about. This government represents a move away from the class war and the class struggle which some members of the other side still believe is being waged&mdash;`the bosses and the workers', as I have heard the member for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Batman say on numerous occasions; the `us and them' sort of concept. Rather, we are introducing legislation which returns to both employers and employees a degree of personal or individual autonomy that is so essential to the flexibility of the industrial relations climate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can have all the job subsidy schemes and artificial job creation programs you are able to invent. You can keep kids in the education system and you can push them to the zenith of their educational achievement for years on end beyond their natural abilities and beyond their interests for jobs that are not likely to exist. You can push all the widows and middle&hyphen;age people you like on to pensions to try to reduce the number of registered unemployed. But, unless you create real jobs, unless you give people incentives to get out of bed, take a risk, invest, save and go to the bank to get a second mortgage on their house to create a business, there is not a damn thing you can do for anybody. What has happened over the last 13 years in particular is that we have gone into a world where the labour movement has had far more influence over the decisions of government&mdash;and, in particular, the employment of people&mdash;than it should. What we require in Australia is a level playing field where employers and employees work much more on an equal footing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people speaking in this debate from the other side have also talked about this concept of `no&hyphen;one being worse off' and have tried in some way to embarrass the Prime Minister over commitments that we gave prior to the election. But what about the cruel insensitivity of two successive Prime Ministers of the previous government? The first Prime Minister said, `No child will be living in poverty by 1990.' It is now 1996 and we have got 600,000. The second Prime Minister rather glibly, if not flippantly, then said in relation to the economic downturn, `This is the recession that we had to have.' There are 850,000 people in this country who are unemployed and there are many working part time who would like to work full time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the previous government talks about the alleged 713,000 jobs they created, they do <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2311"> not tell us about the 270,000 that were lost in the recession. They do not tell us how many of those are full&hyphen;time jobs which people have actually achieved and wanted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In finishing, I would like to say that the member for Hotham is trying hard and that he is sincere, but he does not get it. He does not understand that all the talk about the number of jobs created, training and ILO conventions means absolutely nothing to an army of people who are unemployed, thousands of whom are armed only with disillusionment, hopelessness and despair. This bill will return hope.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan). The previous speaker, the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), said that the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill was about creating a level playing field. Regrettably, that is not the case. This legislation is about employer prerogative and about workers being compelled to negotiate terms of surrender to that employer prerogative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> More than that, this proposed legislation is fundamentally flawed and misconceived. It represents a throwback not to the language of the postwar 1950s but to the 1890s. During that period there was massive industrial action in many sectors of society but mainly in the maritime industry, the shearing industry and the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That action substantially arose out of a conflict between workers and their employers as to the right of workers to improve terms and conditions by collectively bargaining. The employers had a resounding victory. There was a complete collapse of any collective bargaining framework and union membership fell to below five per cent of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequence, however, was a universal awareness of the tremendous destruction caused by such intense industrial conflict. That reality was the very reason that some 105 years ago our constitutional founders debated the need for our federal parliament to have the power to settle industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 3 April 1891, in the course of those constitutional debates, Charles Kingston, a representative from South Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is impossible, having regard to the disastrous effects which are occasioned to society generally, to leave the contending parties to fight the matter out to the bitter end, and the only means which occur to me by which some good can be done is the appointment of a tribunal qualified to investigate the matters in dispute, to reconcile the parties if possible, or, if such a course be impossible, to pronounce an award. . . Conciliation and arbitration therefore seems to me the only means of doing anything towards the settlement of the difficulties to which I refer.</PARA>
<PARA>That rationale, that motivation, was taken up in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1904. When moving the second reading, the Hon. Alfred Deakin, the member for Ballarat, said on 22 March 1904&mdash;in respect of the establishment of the Australian Court of Conciliation and Arbitration:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is sought to be done, therefore, is not, as is popularly supposed and currently stated, to endeavour to declare in an act of parliament what wages shall be paid or what conditions shall be observed in particular trade. That is obviously and transparently impossible. What is sought to be done is to create a tribunal . . . and possessing all the knowledge that can be obtained in relation to any matter that may be brought before it, so have authority to pronounce judgement between the disputants. It is not to pronounce judgement, be it observed, according to the bidding of the statute which creates it.</PARA>
<PARA>The thrust of that extract is clearly directed at the constitutional head of power going to the ability of the federal parliament to establish the mechanism to resolve disputes as to pay and conditions, but not for parliament to intrude into that relationship to prescribe what shall or shall not be a part of the employment relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context the government has fundamentally misconceived this parliament's powers in respect of industrial relations. It has traditionally been the case that the primary constitutional basis of the federal Industrial Relations Act has been paragraph 51(xxxv) of the Australian constitution. That paragraph gives the federal parliament power in respect of `conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one state'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2312">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first potential flaw in the bill is contained in schedule 5 to the bill, dealing with awards. The commission's powers in respect of awards is confined in proposed section 89A to the 18 core conditions there specified. Proposed subsection 89A(3) states that the commission's power to make or vary an award dealing with those core conditions is limited to making a minimum rates award, even if the dispute has nothing to do with a minimum rates award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, schedule 5 does not appear to rely on the corporations head, the territories head or the interstate or international trade provisions of the constitution and one assumes can only be justified by paragraph 51(xxxv) of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But parliament cannot use paragraph 51(xxxv) of the constitution to prescribe the contents of an award or contract of employment. Specifically, parliament cannot direct the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which is entrusted with the conciliation and arbitration function, to exercise its discretion to produce a specific result, or restrict the manner in which it goes about fulfilling that role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a crucial and primary area where the government has simply got it wrong. It is worth considering an analysis undertaken by the Industrial Relations Court of Australia exercising the jurisdiction of the High Court in a very recent case, Comalco Aluminium (Bell Bay) Ltd v. O'Connor, a 1995 decision. The Full Court there said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are statements in a number of cases to the effect that a person or body invested with the power to settle disputes by conciliation and arbitration cannot consistently with the limits arising out of section 51(xxxv), be directed by Parliament to exercise its arbitration power so as to produce a specified result.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what this bill purports to do and what it cannot do&mdash;and a number of cases were referred to in that case as supporting that principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this bill the government is purporting to prescribe that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission only has the power to make a minimum rates award, and that clearly offends against the authorities discussed in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bell Bay case. It is seeking to impose in the relationship of employee and employer statutory preconditions irrespective of the wishes of the parties to the employment relationship. That is something it clearly cannot do under the industrial relations power. The parliament cannot restrict the power of the commission to one of making minimum rates awards only as is contemplated by proposed section 89A(3). Nor can it restrict the commission from settling a dispute regarding the engagement of part&hyphen;time or casual labour by prescribing a particular outcome, as this bill purports to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is also flawed in so far as there is no power in this parliament to legislatively vary or rescind awards. But that is again what is proposed in item 44 of part 2 of schedule 5. That item provides that, other than the 18 core conditions of awards permissible under the new legislation, the remainder of award provisions will become invalid. This is effectively parliament purporting to rescind the provisions of awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1953 the High Court of Australia, in Queen v. Kelly, ex parte Australian Railways Union, considered the power of the then Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to vary awards. While the then court had the power to vary awards to correct or improve upon their provisions in order to give them greater efficacy and to prolong the settlement of the dispute, the court specifically said in terms of section 51(xxxv) of the constitution:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An arbitral tribunal deriving its authority under an exercise of the legislative power given by section 51(xxxv) must confine itself to conciliation and arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes including what is incidental thereto and cannot have in its hands the general control or direction of industrial, social or economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is precisely what this proposed legislation purports to do. Item 44 of part 2 of schedule 5&mdash;which provides that, at the end of 18 months, those non-core conditions of the award cease to have effect&mdash;is unquestionably legislating to dictate the contents of an employment relationship, something Alfred Deakin specifically acknowledged could not be done by federal parliament under the constitution. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2313">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also no power in the constitution to remove rights without appropriate and fair compensation. But, by virtue of proposed clause 44 in schedule 5 of the bill, 18 months after the legislation comes into effect the rights of workers, other than in respect of the 18 core or allowable matters, will evaporate. According to the legislation, they will cease to have any effect whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statutory removal of those award rights will mean the loss of proprietary entitlements&mdash;that is, the loss of a previously enforceable right to a payment from their employer in respect of the performance of their contract of employment and a great number of conditions. The Commonwealth cannot appropriate or remove rights without fair and just compensation. The bill contains no such provision for any compensation. Again, those parts of the bill which would have the effect of removing established rights are clearly invalid. I refer the minister to section 51(xxxi) of the constitution and to the case of Georgiadis v. Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation, a 1994 case of the High Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also no power to prescribe common rule conditions, which again this bill purports to do. Paragraph 51(xxxv) of the constitution does not enable the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to prescribe or make common rule conditions&mdash;that is, conditions which have universal application, irrespective of the parties or the matters in dispute between the parties. There are many statements of the principle, which is perhaps best summarised in another High Court case&mdash;the 1981 case of the Queen v. Alley, ex parte New South Wales Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union&mdash;where the High Court said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament attempted soon after Federation to provide for declaration of common Rules which would be binding upon persons in particular industries. This was declared invalid by this court</PARA>
<PARA>And reference was made by the High Court to the famous Whybrow case of 1910. In so far as the government has attempted in schedule 5&mdash;specifically clauses 44 and 41&mdash;to remove settled rights from all employment relationships, it is purporting to vary the terms <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of settlement of disputes en masse and nationally, contrary to those principles adumbrated in those cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the advisers to the government have seen the problems with constitutionality and have purported to rely on the corporations and related powers in the constitution. The limitations arising from the industrial relations power of the constitution are clearly why the government's advisers have purported to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hence, in the Australian workplace agreements part of the bill, the government has attempted to rely upon the other heads, such as constitutional corporations, the Commonwealth, the territories, waterside workers, maritime employees and flight crew officers. Even though the government has looked to those other heads of power, there is a significant doubt as to whether schedule 11 of the bill, relating to Australian workplace agreements, can be characterised as a law `with respect to', for instance, one of those constitutional corporations rather than one which is in actual fact the reality&mdash;that is, the law is actually a law `with respect to' industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Justice Dawson recently said in Re Dingjan, ex parte Wagner&mdash;a 1995 case of the High Court of Australia concerning section 127C of the Industrial Relations Act&mdash;federal parliament cannot introduce constitutional corporations as a peg upon which to hang legislation, not upon the subject of constitutional corporations but upon an entirely different subject. That is what this government is trying to do. It is trying to put these Australian workplace agreements which affect employment relationships on entirely different pegs to the industrial relations power which quite simply do not fit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in attempting to do so, this government has left a vacuum in respect of non-corporate employers. The fact is that this proposed legislation substantially departs from the industrial relations power and has, of necessity, left a vacuum in respect of non-corporate employers, which includes all sole traders and partnerships together with state government employees. Your local corner store is likely to be a sole trader. This bill <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2314"> will have absolutely nothing to do with the regulation of their employment relationships. Of course, the government's claimed heartland is the small business sector, but this bill will be essentially meaningless to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the unfair dismissal provisions, I have heard with annoyance reference to a number of specific cases. I have experience in the New South Wales jurisdiction where the test is a fair go all&hyphen;round. The cases to which they refer will be little different under that system. This legislation will make little difference to the way the tribunals deliberate. A government should not try to enforce its will on such deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, in respect to unfair dismissal, contains a time bomb. It is likely to be set aside because it is based upon the Australian Industrial Relations Commission exercising judicial power contrary to the well&hyphen;known principle stated by the High Court of Australia in 1956 in the Boilermakers case. Specifically, section 170CI provides that the orders made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission are final and binding between the parties. The Boilermakers case was based on the premise that a dispute about rights and obligations arising from the operation of the law on past events or conduct was an exercise of judicial power and the federal parliament could not bestow or purport to bestow upon an arbitral body such a power. So that part of the legislation is fundamentally flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the registration of enterprise unions, proposed amendments to section 188 of the current act contained in schedule 15 of the bill seek to remove the existing requirement that to be registered a union must be capable of being a party to an interstate industrial dispute. Accordingly, the bill offends the principle that to be registered under the federal act an industrial organisation must be capable of becoming involved in an interstate industrial dispute. It is based on the interstate dispute provisions of section 51 (xxxv) of the constitution. That was first stated in 1908 by the High Court in Jumbunna Coalmines v. Victorian Coalminers Association. So, again, the government's legislation is fundamentally flawed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dislocation that would inevitably occur as a result of the dismantling of sections of trade unions to create the so&hyphen;called enterprise unions, the moving of members into enterprise unions and the subsequent determination that those enterprise unions are invalid would quite simply be catastrophic. Very complicated questions as to who would own property and what industrial instruments would continue to operate would arise. Both employees and employers would literally have to go back to scratch to renegotiate their industrial relations. Employees who pay membership subscriptions to enterprise unions risk losing that money because it will inevitably be found that they are unconstitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this brief period of 20 minutes I have attempted to provide an analysis of where this bill is fundamentally flawed in a number of respects. If ever there was a need for a bill to be considered in detail at the appropriate stage, it is this bill. I hope the government will not attempt to gag the process. If it does, it will certainly do so at its peril. All the bravado, all the Shakespearian acting that occurs at question time, will have no effect at all on the High Court of Australia when it comes to consider these very serious matters in light of reasoned argument&mdash;and I stress reasoned argument&mdash;and in light of long&hyphen;established principles that the court itself has upheld now for over 92 years. If the government tries to steamroll this through, one or two people on the other side of this House will be chronically embarrassed, if not mortally wounded.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to speak tonight on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. Whilst there has been a lot of discussion tonight, I would like to reiterate some of the valid points as to why the government is pursuing this legislation, look at the objectives and, most importantly, the shift and the dynamics in union power which have occurred over the last decade and look at the reasons why industrial relations reform is required to make a more competitive environment in Australia&mdash;particularly at our workplace level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2315">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thrust of the government's policy and its legislation is to reshape the industrial relations system. This naturally means going back to a workplace arrangement where there is a more cooperative spirit between employees and employers rather than having the unwarranted intervention of third parties in many cases. Whether it is the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, union intervention or, indeed, any other third party, the thrust of the legislation is to provide a more flexible arrangement for employees at an enterprise level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways, the last remaining area in the Australian economy which needs reform is industrial relations. We have certainly seen it&mdash;some of the credit must go to the previous government&mdash;in the financial sector and the communications sector. But it is in the labour market area where we have seen a very rigid system. We inherited that system at the turn of the century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another objective of the bill is to provide minimum standards for workers, to provide a safety net for workers, to provide freedom of association and to recognise anti-discrimination in the workplace. This will be provided for through an award system, through AWAs and through certified agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go on I would like to talk about the thrust of this legislation and why there is so much debate by the opposition about our reforms. In many ways, I believe it is to do with the struggle of union participation in the work force and union power. Naturally, when you turn the clock back 100 years to the 1880s&mdash;and also to the early part of the century and even recently&mdash;you can see there are very valid reasons for the existence of a trade union movement. The changing nature of Australia's work force and the changing nature of part&hyphen;time and casual work and of the role of women and subcontractors in the work force has meant that the award system and the current legislative environment do not cater for the new demands on the Australian work force as it moves into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In many ways, as the trade union movement's power base diminishes, this is why it is particularly concerned about this legislation. The whole thrust of the govern ment's plan is to simplify the award structure. The union movement covers only 35 per cent of the work force and, in that respect, only 26 per cent are in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Union power in many ways is broader than that; it is the industrial relations club. It is made up of the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;in its previous guise the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission&mdash;the law courts, union participants and employer structures. That club has been functioning for quite some time and in many ways to the detriment of the deregulation of the labour market. We want to expose the labour market to competition and we want to remove some of the obstacles. We believe that, through economic reforms, that will be in the best interests of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This struggle by the opposition is to do with the union movement's loss of power in the labour market process. I suppose if I were in their shoes I might be struggling the same amount. But the fact is that they are starting to lose their relevance as the union membership declines. There has been a substantial decline in trade union membership over the years. In 1988, 42 per cent of the labour force was in the union movement. That figure has now dropped down to 35 per cent or 2.5 million out of a total work force of nine million. On top of that we have another 750,000 who unfortunately do not have work and are classified as unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many respects the union movement no longer represent the work force, they no longer represent the Australian worker, because they represent only quite a small percentage of the labour market. That is why we have seen quite substantial changes in the union movement over the last five years&mdash;particularly with the amalgamation of unions as they move from craft unions to workplace unions&mdash;as they struggle to remain relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that when you look at the level of strike activity and the level of union membership you find that they have both been diminishing on almost exactly the same graph. In other words, as union membership has been declining so too has the level of strike activity. This just might be a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2316"> passing coincidence, but the test has certainly been over the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So perhaps one of the areas of opposition to this bill, which is designed to provide a more flexible agreement in the workplace, is that there is a struggle now within the ACTU. In many ways this is highlighted because the federal parliament has almost become a retirement club for many of the members in the union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) has joined us. There were other members. There was the previous Prime Minister, the previous Treasurer, the previous members of the ACTU and others in the Senate. You have to ask yourself: if the union movement were so strong and believed that they were providing a valuable contribution to the Australian work force, why is the lure of federal parliament more attractive than perhaps the lure of looking after their work force?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nor like my grandfather, who knocked off a sitting member, if the member for Batman wishes to know the history. But I did note that he was here for my maiden speech, so I appreciate that. Perhaps the union movement is concerned because the level of funding the previous government gave will start to diminish. In the Hawke-Keating period over $92 million went to the union movement. Those contributions, to my knowledge, were tax free and often these funds naturally came back to the ALP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, it is rather ironic that whilst this pump priming was going on the level of industrial disputation was diminishing. In 1984-85 the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees was over 240. In 1995 that figure was down to 75. As union <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> membership has declined we have seen a decline in strike activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government's industrial relations minister, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), pushed us towards non-union bargaining. He pushed towards a decentralisation which in many ways the tenets of this bill are picking up. He was stymied of course; it was rejected by the ACTU. One particular case I would like to mention is Tweed Valley Fruit Processors, an enterprise in the electorate of Richmond. This company embraced Laurie Brereton's industrial relations reforms.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ6">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, I am very glad to see that the member for Watson is here. Tweed Valley Fruit Processors adopted an enterprise flexibility agreement. They were encouraged by the government of the time. They were given a grant of $25,000 to go towards an enterprise bargaining agreement. They were covered by the food preservers interim award. This is a rather archaic award.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it turned out, none of the workers at Tweed Valley Fruit Processors were covered by a union. They entered into the spirit of an agreement, as they were encouraged to do by the previous government. When they reached agreement, at the eleventh hour it was knocked back by the ACTU. They were covered by an award which allowed for working five days from Monday to Friday. The processing of fruit is a cyclical business. Whether it is passionfruit, bananas or whatever that needs processing, the workload varies from time to time throughout the year. Under this award, if employees wanted to work on a weekend, they had to have worked the previous five days. The award was very rigid and it did not suit the cyclical nature of the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2317"> Also in the agreement they negotiated was a trade-off of sick leave, which was the subject of great comment in the national press. Employees were to be paid out for it. It was in relation to this that their agreement was rejected by the ACTU and, as it turned out, the full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission. It is rather ironic that the previ ous minister made special agreements in relation to sick leave with those involved in the construction of the Glebe Island Bridge and also Mascot airport. In both cases sick leave provisions were traded off. The point I am making is that the previous government and the unions have consistently had double standards in enterprise agreements. This has been reflected on more than one occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole purpose of this bill is to provide a much more flexible environment where there is no third party intervention, unless it is invited. This will be done in part by Australian work agreements where minimum conditions will be protected and recognised&mdash;18 minimum conditions&mdash;and certified agreements where union participation is desired. The thrust of this is to provide flexibility in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point the government is focusing on is freedom of choice by removing compulsory unionism. There should be nothing wrong with that in this free democracy we live in. Why should there be special privileges for those unions which have compulsory unionism, where employees do not have a choice if they wish to have that choice? One of the tenets of this bill is to provide for a far more free and flexible environment where employees can choose whether or not they wish to belong to a union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways this also covers secondary boycotts. Under the previous government we saw the removal of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act relating to secondary boycotts. It is the government's intention to reintroduce them so that innocent victims, whether they be employees or employers, will not be dragged into industrial disputes, at a second or third party level, which they have nothing to do with. A secondary boycott was clearly demonstrated in the recent dispute involving CRA in Weipa. Unions in many other parts of the country went on strike when they had nothing to do with the individuals striking in North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Another point is the unfair dismissal legislation. If one piece of draconian legislation was introduced by the previous government&mdash;maybe it was done with the best intent, but it is a debacle&mdash;it is that covering unfair dis missals. I think even the opposition would recognise this has been a major detriment to employment generation in this country in the last three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will explain the unfair dismissal law for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record and then give an example where the employer may be faced with an unfair dismissal. Currently, if you have someone employed in an unsuitable arrangement, naturally you have to give a warning, a second warning and then another in writing. In addition, for unfair dismissal an employer can be dragged through the courts for one or two months. That does not have to be for serious offences. It would be a debacle if it were the other way around, if it were the employer who had to seek approval to dismiss an employee&mdash;the reverse analogy. The government is proposing to remove the unfair dismissal laws to provide an environment where employers are no longer intimidated about putting on staff for fear that if the arrangements do not work out they then cannot come to an amicable separation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to a recent example involving a butcher shop in my electorate. It is not a large enterprise; it has only five employees. It has been involved in three cases of unfair dismissal. I might add that when this legislation was introduced the President of the Industrial Relations Commission, Deirdre O'Connor, highlighted that it would produce a tidal wave of claims for the Industrial Relations Commission. Indeed, that is exactly what has happened. The commission has been bogged down with this ridiculous legislation. The removal of the unfair dismissal legislation and its replacement by a much fairer and equitable piece of legislation will be a major benefit to employers and, I believe, employees as years go by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have tried to point out in my speech tonight that the government is committed to reforming the industrial relations system in Australia and to removing the exclusive club that has existed in this country. I have tried to demonstrate that the role of the union is no longer that which existed years ago. Its power is diminishing. In many ways this opposition to the legislation is a result of a union power struggle. Nevertheless, there are many benefits <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2318"> for Australia, for employees and for employers as we move into the next century. The government is focusing on the last area of Australia that has not been deregulated and where there needs to be greater flexibility as our workplace arrangements change: the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to freedom of choice, which is a critical element of the government's bill, when Quentin Cook, who was and still is a member of the communications, electrical and plumbing union, spoke just recently he described the ballot process of the elections he ran in as an Independent candidate. It makes me wonder how there could have been such an abuse of democracy within many unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In this case, the ballot process of the Electoral Commission, which I would like to explain to the House, is conducted through the mail and run over a month. There is the potential for forgery in some areas. This type of change to the legislation will result in fairer elections, which I believe is in the interests of the unions. There will also be fair representation, irrespective of the political persuasion of the trade unions. This will be a major plus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the government's Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill will help to reshape the Australian industrial relations system. It will remove secondary boycotts and the unfair dismissal system. It will look at greater freedom of association. It will simplify an award system which, in many ways, has become archaic as the structure of the Australian workplace has changed.</PARA></SPEECH>

I am very pleased, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, to be making these submissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's legislation is based on a premise that both parties are equal in an employment contract. This is clearly a false position. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), when he spoke here this afternoon in this debate, made that point very clearly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our present Industrial Relations Act is based on the master and servant relationship whereby the employer, with his bottom line position of being able to hire and fire, has the ultimate advantage over his employees. This is particularly true during periods of high unemployment. This employment advantage has been balanced somewhat over the past 40 years and longer by the trade union movement and the Industrial Relations Commission. However, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is designed to remove this balance by reducing the influence of both the trade union movement and the Industrial Relations Commission. This also obviously and dramatically reduces protection for workers. Both parties are clearly not now equal. Under this proposed legislation, they will be less equal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not defend either the trade union movement or the Industrial Relations Commission simply as institutions in themselves but because I believe they serve a great purpose. Based on my industrial experience over a long period, I believe that it is in the best interests of working people to have a strong organisation such as a trade union, that it is in the best interests of employers to also have strong organisations to protect their interests and that it is best for the Industrial Relations Commission to be an appropriate umpire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The stripping back of awards to 18 core conditions removes many clauses that have been put in awards for the benefit of both parties&mdash;employees and employers. For example, I find it very difficult to separate training from industrial relations. For me, both of them go together. Both issues need to be looked at collectively to deliver an efficient and highly trained work force that in turn leads to higher productivity and internationally competitive Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the metal industry award clause 6C on training, which reads:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2319">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parties to this award recognise that, in order to increase the efficiency, productivity and international competitiveness of industry, a greater commitment to training and skill development is required. Accordingly, the parties commit themselves to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> developing a more highly skilled and flexible work force</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> providing employees with career opportunities through appropriate training to acquire additional skills; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) removing barriers to the utilisation of skills required.</PARA>
<PARA>Who could take objection to that clause? It is a very progressive clause. To have clauses like that stripped from awards will be an extremely backward step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the lack of workplace organisation and representation, people working for small business are likely to be worse off under this legislation, as the conditions they lose are unlikely to be picked up in workplace agreements. Therefore, the government's pre&hyphen;election promise that workers will have an effective choice between awards and workplace agreements and that workers will be no worse off if they choose to remain exclusively within the award system is now sounding extremely hollow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also believe that many employers, particularly in small business, would like to operate under an award which sets standards that can be increased if the financial state of the particular business allows. I do not believe that business, particularly small business, wants to be involved in lengthy negotiations every time an issue arises that may not be covered in a limited award or is not covered by a certified agreement. This would only add to the cost of running small business. The aim of the Howard government is to try to use small business as the cutting edge of its industrial relations policy, thus achieving lower wages, artificially reducing costs and allegedly achieving greater productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot has been said about the unfair dismissal provisions of the arbitration act. Over the time I have been in this House, it seems to be something that the members of the government have had some difficulty with. I believe that some of the difficulties experienced by small business in the area of unfair dismissals have been caused by ill-informed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legal advice, resulting in some employers taking the easy way out by agreeing to financial settlements rather than allowing their employer organisation to argue the merits of the claim and requiring the arbitration commission to settle it on its merits. I listened to the contribution by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price). He made exactly this point. Quite clearly, it is a view that is shared quite a lot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make the point that this applies to people who are not in unions. In many cases they have possibly been ripped off by unscrupulous legal representatives. I did hear of a case where a worker who was not in a union had legal representation and got a settlement for unfair dismissal of $1,600. His representative went to the employer and said, `Make out two cheques: one for $1,000 for me and one for $600 for the worker.' I make the point that, if any legislation is to work successfully, it is very important that the parties involved are represented by their appropriate organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the economy. Those on the other side seem to give little recognition to the recent good economic conditions that have been brought about by the previous government's policy. These good economic conditions include: an increase of 1.8 per cent in gross domestic product for the March quarter and an annual growth of 4.8 per cent; low inflation; controlled wage growth; and, most importantly, a good industrial relations climate and a flexible vocational training system that enabled large and small employers to train their work force either through an apprenticeship system or through a trainee system that allowed training to be more focused on the individual needs of the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not classify small businesses as a whingeing group of people, which seems to be the picture being portrayed&mdash;quite unfairly, I suggest&mdash;by some government speakers who blame all the difficulties on the unfair dismissals of the Industrial Relations Act. The small business people that I come across in the electorate of Greenway through their involvement in a number of Working Nation programs&mdash;and I have complimented them on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2320"> this in other debates&mdash;have been very progressive and very innovative. They have turned many of these programs, such as the new work opportunities program, to their advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point&mdash;and I am sure this point has not been made by any speakers from the government side&mdash;that the new work opportunities program was exempt from the unfair dismissal provisions of the arbitration act. That meant that small business could take a worker on, train him for six months to see whether he was satisfactory and, if he was not satisfactory, the employer could part with that employee without any penalty. We do not hear that side of the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to emphasise that there is a need, however, for strong industrial relations law to protect working people. The people on the government side take some delight in saying they represent working people, but you would not think so if you heard their speeches because they are not saying anything in this debate about working people. I want to give a few examples of why I believe we need strong industrial relations laws to protect working people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example concerns a young person who had worked in the retail industry for over seven years and had worked himself up into a middle management position. This person found a small amount of money on the floor. He confided to another senior employee that he had found the money and put the money in the drawer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The person concerned had no intention of keeping the money but, because he did not immediately hand the money in, he was dismissed for a breach of company regulations. This young man agrees that he was unwise in not handing the money in immediately, but considered, in view of his previous good employment record, that he was harshly dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In time this young man found employment with another firm in the same industry and was employed for over six months when news of his first indiscretion was deliberately&mdash;and I stress deliberately&mdash;passed on to his new employer. He was then dismissed from his second job because of what happened with his <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> first employer. He then languished unemployed and unemployable because of this double dismissal until the matter was drawn to my attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was able to get the appropriate union, the SDA, to take the case to the Industrial Relations Commission. The commissioner, to his credit, was able to negotiate a settlement that cleared this young man of any serious misdemeanour concerning his first employer, which meant the lad was able to go out and seek further employment with a clean slate. If the union and the Industrial Relations Commission had not become involved, this young man would have been unemployed for many years and would have had a black mark against his name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another case that I was involved in concerned a young girl. We do not hear about these cases from the people opposite who claim to represent working people. This young girl worked in a local chemist shop. She was being hassled and accused of stealing. This girl rang her father in tears and her father responded as any father would. He immediately went down to the chemist shop and told the employer what he thought of him. As a result of his action, the father had a court restraining order placed on him and his daughter lost her job at that chemist shop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To back these two examples up I would like to refer to a report carried out by the Griffith University in Brisbane. This study explores the effect of managerial styles on employees' health and wellbeing in organisations undergoing restructuring. The report&mdash;which I doubt anybody on the government side would have read&mdash;is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managerial styles and their effects on employees' health and well-being in organisations undergoing restructuring</EMPHASIS> by Paul McCarthy, Michael Sheehan and Dan Kearns. It was carried out by the School of Organisational Behaviour and Human Resources Management, Faculty of Commerce Administration, Griffith University, Nathan, Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report questioned 373 people in different industries. A total of 222 reported being bullied and, of these, 71 sought counselling or medical advice, and 74 took time off work&mdash;as much as 50 days annually&mdash;as a result of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2321"> being bullied. Those who experienced bullying attributed it to a lack of communication, gaining power, making the management feel good, scapegoating and wanting to teach a lesson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These tactics are also rife in the unorganised legal profession&mdash;that is, unorganised for the workers. In this industry women, in particular, are bullied, threatened and victimised. Often the victimisation appears in such subtle ways that it is difficult for them to pursue any avenues of justice without themselves being accused of being whingers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women are often forced to shorten their maternity leave and, sometimes, in order to become partners they have to sign a no&hyphen;pregnancy clause. According to this report, these types of strongarm tactics may be costing business more than $100 million annually with stress leave, absenteeism, psychological counselling and productivity losses. Strongarm management tactics such as blaming, labelling, verbal abuse, intimidation and threats were experienced by more than 60 per cent of employees questioned in this Griffith University study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have raised these examples to bring some balance into the debate on unfair dismissals and to clearly show that there is a need for strong industrial relations laws to protect working people, particularly those working for small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of the government's legislation that I want to comment on is its intention to restrict the right of union officials to enter a workplace during meal breaks to recruit new members and to contact existing members who may choose to be anonymous.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There you go. This is an arrangement I worked under for over 20 years and I can say with some certainty that the arrangement, in itself, did not result in any industrial problems. The union officials, behaving correctly&mdash;as we always did&mdash;rang the employer in advance and requested permission to visit the factory on a particular day. The agreement was usually reached on a day that suited the employer's requirements. Because of my experience, this was a non&hyphen;issue. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is the government so hell&hyphen;bent on proceeding with it? Who is twisting arms? What is the hidden agenda? I believe the agenda is to reduce the exposure of working people to trade unions and, therefore, to reduce the number of workers that eventually will belong to trade unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) makes great play of the fact that 35 per cent of working people belong to trade unions. No doubt he would like to see a lower figure. The fact is that many working people know they can join a trade union if they get in trouble. Also, in the main, under the accord they have picked up wages and conditions won by the trade union movement. The fact is that the trade union movement continues to represent all working people, whether or not they are members of a trade union. The government should not forget this fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many times when I visited factories I saw from statements on the office wall that the employer was a member of a number of employer organisations such as the MTIA or the Employers Federation. But the same employer occasionally got uptight if his own workers wanted to join the trade union. I am sure that, if an employer organisation wanted to talk to a non&hyphen;union employer, he would have no trouble arranging an interview, at least a one&hyphen;off interview during working hours. So what is his problem about the trade union movement seeking to contact members during the meal break? This is a clear case of double standards. I believe this restriction on the right of trade union officials to the work site puts a lie to the government's claim that it is not anti&hyphen;union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of concern is the government's plan to water down the present powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, stopping it from scrutinising non&hyphen;union wage agreements. It intends to set up an Office of the Employment Advocate in which non&hyphen;union deals, to be called Australian workplace agreements, will be filed. These agreements are to be filed in secret, free from union scrutiny. They are also to be the vehicle for individual employment contracts. This process will lead to a duplication of effort and, in effect, will create two industrial <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2322"> relations commissions: one dealing with non&hyphen;union issues and one with mainstream industrial relations issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resources to be allocated to the Employment Advocate to fund inspectorial and advisory functions will no doubt reduce the resources available to the mainstream industrial relations system. The establishment of an Employment Advocate is designed to provide a government controlled advisory service for non&hyphen;union people at taxpayers' expense, which will obviously promote only the government's view and not the independent service that we presently have. If the government is to be consistent in its user&hyphen;pays policy, services provided by the Employment Advocate should also be chargeable to the non&hyphen;union sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government does not agree to the user&hyphen;pays principle, then the taxpayer funded Employment Advocate should be available to all sections of the work force, union and non&hyphen;union alike. This attack on the industrial relations system is the most serious attack since an earlier member for Flinders, Lord Stanley Melbourne Bruce, attempted to abolish the arbitration system in the early part of this century. Lord Bruce, a member of the Melbourne Establishment, went to the 1929 federal election with a policy of dismantling the arbitration act and allowing the states to enact their own industrial legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bruce government lost that election and Lord Stanley Melbourne Bruce lost his seat of Flinders. No doubt fearing the same fate as the Bruce government, the Howard government is now moving with some caution but with the same intent and, I submit, will have the same result, that is, the loss of the seat of Flinders and the loss of government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pleasure to speak on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. It is a historic piece of legislation which will lead Australia's employment practices into the 21st century. I listened to the former Premier of Western Australia and member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), who opened the debate today, saying that this particular bill will hit women. This is the standard attitude of members opp <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> osite. They like to think that this legislation is aimed at kicking workers while they are down and they like to assume that all employers are ogres. It is a fantasy of theirs that entertains them in their dreams at night but, at the end of the day, it is just pure fantasy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a bit rich for the member for Fremantle to feign concern for women when she was responsible for allowing a member of her own party, the despicable John Halden, under parliamentary privilege, to dredge up false allegations about a woman in a Family Court dispute which led to that woman's suicide. If she were concerned about women, she could have started showing that concern a long time ago. Look at the member for Fremantle as a boss. When she was Minister for Human Services and Health, one of her staff members took the minister to the Industrial Relations Commission for unfair dismissal. She was one of six Labor members taken there for unfair dismissal. When it comes to treating employees badly, the members opposite are the guilty party well and truly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the member for Chifley (Mr Price) admitted that the issue of unfair dismissal was a real problem for the Labor Party at the last election. He had an unfair dismissal case taken against him by a staff member, so he certainly ought to know about this sort of thing. I stand here quite proud of my record as a boss. Since my election in March 1993 I have not lost one employee. I have the same workers in my office today as I had in March 1993 and they are all doing an excellent job.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is a reflection on the work practices within my office. I am pleased to hear that your office runs likewise. Obviously, Madam Deputy Speaker's office runs likewise. I only say that because those opposite think we are industrial relations monsters and that we have it in for employees. Nothing could be further from the truth. I would like to see details of the turnover of staff in the offices of members opposite and see how they compare as employers with the members on this side of the House. I think they would find that interesting read <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2323"> ing. Let us see whether their concern for workers extends to their own offices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some stories that I have heard about some members opposite indicate that what they say and what they do are two completely different things. They certainly do not practise what they preach. Those opposite say we are anti&hyphen;worker. I would like any one of those opposite to compare their record with mine, as far as being from the working class is concerned. I left school at 14 and my first job was scrubbing vats in a cheese factory in the south&hyphen;east of South Australia. I then worked on a fishing team in the west.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 seeks to extend the migration agents registration scheme by another 12 months, to 21 September 1997. The opposition supports the bill and supports its exemption from the Senate cut&hyphen;off rule. The Labor government had before parliament in 1995 an almost identical bill to extend the same scheme by one year, while awaiting a report from the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. The then coalition opposition held up the passage of that bill to a point where the MAR scheme was at risk of collapse. Without wishing to impute any motive at the time, because the bill was part of a package of other measures, I think it was really quite <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2327"> mischievous that that bill was not allowed to go forward, even after the then government proposed that it could be severed from those other measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition participated fully in the standing committee which reviewed the scheme. The then shadow minister, Senator Short, was on the committee and fully endorsed the recommendations in the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable?: the Migration Agents Registration Scheme</EMPHASIS>, which was published in May 1995. Since that time, the government has changed. I would simply make the point that, given that Senator Short and the coalition were part of that review process, there ought to be no significant need for further delay in terms of responding to the report. The coalition ought to be well placed to make a decision in relation to improvements to the scheme and to respond to the recommendations in the standing committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, we think it appropriate that the government be permitted 12 months in which to review its position and to make some judgments as to what courses of action it would regard as most appropriate in this area. But, in terms of some of the recommendations made by the joint standing committee, particularly those that were directed towards protecting the vulnerable, we would hope that it would not wait a full 12 months to respond. It is quite open for the government to respond much more quickly on many of those matters, I believe. I would certainly be happy to have discussions with the minister in relation to cooperating to ensure that we are able to address, without any delay, those practical areas in which we may have agreement. That would be the way in which we would intend to deal with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should perhaps take just a couple of minutes, however, to respond to some comment in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> this morning and the publication of a poll on attitudes to migration. I do so only because I think it is important to realise that polls of this nature have been held frequently over the last couple of decades and results of the kind that have been published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> are not unfamiliar to anybody who has been following the debate in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the conclusions drawn in the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, but what I find particularly reassuring is the strong support amongst the Australian community for the processes of multiculturalism that have been established in this country and also the fact that, where concern is expressed about the level of migration, it is overwhelmingly driven by concern about issues of employment rather than by any sense of racism. I think that is very reassuring for the Australian community, because there are some who would take the crude measures in that poll and seek to divide our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are a society that has made a success of having many people from many different backgrounds settling in this country and making it their home. In truth, we have no option but to continue to make that a success. There are now something like 3&half; million Australians of non&hyphen;English speaking background as part of the postwar settlement of this country. They and their families are here as a fact of life in the Australian landscape. Governments of any persuasion, in truth, have no alternative but to devise policies of access and equity&mdash;policies that are designed to enable this great social change that has occurred in our country to go forward as a success. If we allow it to fail, then we tear our own society apart. That, of course, is not something that anyone could countenance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to make those short comments about the poll in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, to realise that it says nothing that we would not have discerned from polls held over the last 20 years and to reinforce the need for continuing multipartisanship on these issues of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2328"> fundamental importance to our country. I must say that that consensus is fraying a bit around the edges. There are issues which are deeply dividing the parties at the moment regarding some of the policy initiatives of the new government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For my part I would seek to heal those divisions as far as possible and, whilst strongly criticising particular measures that the new government makes, adhere to the view that it is in our interests as a nation that we work together to ensure the success of this great social experiment which Australia embarked on after the end of World War II when it began a process of substantial migration which has continued up until the present day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, contrary to many public understandings, levels of migration into Australia at the moment are at historically very low levels. It is important to realise that. There is a substantial debate amongst many people of academic standing to the effect that migration is a net employment generator, that it is an important source of economic growth and renewal for the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I suppose it is fair to say that, in times when there are relatively high levels of unemployment, that is a hard message to sell. There is an intuitive gut understanding in many Australians who resent people coming into the country when their own children face difficulties in finding employment. These are issues that we need to address seriously and straightforwardly with the Australian community. For my part, as shadow minister for immigration and assistant to the Leader of the Opposition on multicultural affairs, I intend to do that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 is probably one of the simpler bills to come before the House. It seeks to amend part 3 of the Migration Act to extend the migration agents registration scheme for a further year, until 21 September 1997. The scheme was established in September 1992 to replace the regulatory schemes which had proved ineffective in stopping incompetent and unscrupulous migration advisers. The scheme requires the registration of persons providing migration advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions of the scheme basically involve the registration of migration agents and qualifications for such registration. There are also principal components relating to a migration agents registration board, requirements and procedures for registration of migration agents, a code of conduct for migration agents, investigatory and disciplinary procedures, and the sunset clause which planned to terminate the scheme had this legislation not been brought forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another central feature of the scheme is the complaints mechanism. Members will be aware that the May 1995 report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable?: the Migration Agents Registration Scheme</EMPHASIS>, recommended that the scheme be extended. This proposed extension of a year will give the government time to further examine the scheme and consider the recommendations of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps more than any other nation, Australia requires migration agents because of the great appeal of our nation. There are many candidates for migration wishing to see how they could enter our country. Potential migrants are keenly aware that our sandy shores, tolerant people, very stable political environment&mdash;and it is an enhanced political environment after the recent election&mdash;and comparatively high standards of living are something to be longed for. I would suggest they know that to be declined permanent entry into Australia may well stop them from joining friends and colleagues from their communities who have already migrated to this country and perhaps put an end to a dream they have about creating a better life for themselves <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2329"> and their children. The consequences of incorrect and misleading advice are therefore very serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past 40 years in my electorate&mdash;Dunkley&hyphen;by&hyphen;the&hyphen;bay, as I like to refer to it&mdash;we have hosted a wave of immigrants from the United Kingdom and Ireland, as well as people from other nations such as the Netherlands and Greece. And I note for my colleague across the way the importance of the Greek community in our electorate which is also very significant&mdash;as my father&hyphen;in&hyphen;law constantly reminds me, being of Greek descent himself. I hope that I and my colleague across the way, the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), can do some worthwhile work on the Australia&hyphen;Greece interparliamentary group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because most of the migrants coming to my electorate speak English fairly well, some people might think that having advice available through a migration agent is perhaps not as useful as it may be. However, this is changing, and I think that I need to point out that information I have obtained from the two municipalities in my electorate, the Shire of Mornington Peninsula and Frankston City Council, shows that arrivals from non&hyphen;English speaking countries are on the increase. Although in the last 12 months just over 300 of Frankston's 440 new citizens were from the UK and just over 20 were from New Zealand, there were more than 10 new citizens from each of Afghanistan, Ireland, the Philippines and India, and five from Fiji, Italy, Poland and Chile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these people are bilingual but an increasing number may well not be fluent in English. We in the House might think that, while many people wishing to enter the country are fluent in English, we would like to have these migration agents available to ensure that people are getting reliable advice, and that they are able to understand and comprehend the sorts of considerations that our country takes into account, and that they also need to consider, before pursuing a course and becoming part of this great nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in traditional source countries where English is the primary tongue, our discerning migration program, particularly in areas outside the family reunion area, would require some very reliable, informed and comprehensive advice. Potential migrants are paying for that advice under this scheme through agents, in the expectation that the agents' experience with the migration legislation and procedures will, hopefully, improve their prospects for a favourable outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is probably worth putting on record that since the scheme commenced in 1992, 3,407 applications for registration have been received. Of those, 2,580 have been approved and 416 have been refused. I guess the encouraging thing that I take out of that is that there is a clear understanding that people without the capacity to demonstrate a sound knowledge of our migration law and practice are not being given the opportunity to provide advice that could have very significant consequences for the people paying money to receive that advice. This registration process has excluded over 400 unsuitable applicants, and I think that that picks up on the points that the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) was making, and it underlines the title of the report that the joint committee prepared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In March 1996, compared with March 1995, immigration on an Australia&hyphen;wide level was actually up. The biggest jump was from immigrants from north&hyphen;east Asia, arrivals from the Peoples' Republic of China, which rose from 330 to 1,290, almost a fourfold increase. While there has been a decline in Vietnamese immigrants during the month of March, compared with March 1995, both of these countries are heavy users of migration agents.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2330">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the migration agents registration scheme was introduced in 1992, the migration advice industry has developed substantially. I think that all members would probably be able to recount many phone calls that we have had with them looking for advice and assistance. Even if, in its examination of the scheme, the government eventually came to favour partial self&hyphen;regulation, the coalition would remain committed to consumer protection. Industry standards would no doubt be developed, and any changes incorporating new arrangements would be phased in in an orderly fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many migration agents incorporate their business with other activities&mdash;for instance, some are solicitors. Of the registered people under that scheme, that is certainly the group from whom we hear most. Other agents are from voluntary organisations. It is most important that migration agents behave ethically, do not charge unscrupulously and pay strict attention to deadlines imposed by tribunals who review initial decisions about immigration related matters. This further reinforces the need for registered agents to be fully informed and fully au fait with the way the system works and to be very ethical in working with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to stamp out sham marriages and other arrangements that effectively allow some individuals to queue jump ahead of the majority of decent, hardworking potential immigrants who pay a $550 fee to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, as well as paying many hundreds of dollars in their own local currency to migration agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be noted that almost two years have passed since the joint standing committee received submissions on this scheme. By initiating this review, the government was simply speeding up the process of considering possible alternatives to the existing scheme, including a move to self-regulation. This also provided an opportunity to consider what may have occurred in the two years since initial submissions were received to the joint standing committee's work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the government's review, I hope a sensible, long&hyphen;term approach that will benefit potential migrants to Australia will be laid down by my colleague the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, there are other members who are married to Greek Australians. I want to make a couple of points about this legislation. We do not oppose the legislation to extend the requirement by one year, but I want to make two straightforward points. Firstly, we would not be very happy with any attempt to move this scheme towards more self&hyphen;regulation. I understand that the government has to renew the scheme for one year while it looks at it. We have concerns about the operations of the scheme in that we believe that it is not tough enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member mentioned that about 400 to 500 people have been rejected in their applications, and it is true. More than 3,000 people serve this industry. I think that is too many people. Notwithstanding all the propaganda, immigration has been quite low, and many of the cases have been straightforward because the regulations are much tougher and much clearer <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2331"> about which people are admitted or not admitted. There is not as much room for discretion as there used to be once upon a time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that situation, there is the danger that a migration agent, in order to make a living, will do a couple of things which we do not want them to do. Although the bill is supposed to prohibit this, it is very hard to check on. The report from the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable?: the Migration Agents Registration Scheme</EMPHASIS> of May 1995 expresses concern that there has been insufficient monitoring of the activities of the migration agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may have been insufficient monitoring by the department, but some MPs, especially those of us who deal with immigration cases, know about cases where there have been activities which could be called unscrupulous, unethical or unprofessional on the part of migration agents. In some cases people have been charged between $5,000 and $10,000 for a case in which the work that was actually done was not much more than helping people fill in an application form and writing to the local MP to get the local MP to support the case. Of course, the MPs have no stake in this matter in final terms. The situation is that we do not have any systematic evidence but we have significant and total evidence that there are problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it clear that I do not think moving to self&hyphen;regulation or partial self&hyphen;regulation is the answer&mdash;on the contrary. It is certainly not the answer now and will not be until we have seen the scheme operate for a number of years and have weeded out some of those who are misusing the registration. Let me be blunt about that. Good luck to those decent migration agents that are doing a good job and are helping us in the migration system. They can make a living out of that, fine. It is the ones who are misusing the registration that are the difficulty and we still continue to have problems reported to MPs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one thing that I think the government and the department have got to take up. They have got to take up a system in which a letter is sent to every member of parliament from the department saying, `If you have a case of a person reporting a migration agent as behaving in a manner which is not acceptable, then you should contact the following number and we will keep your information confidential.' I repeat that point, `We will keep your information confidential.' Even members of parliament are not going to be too keen to report these things. It may be that there is a dispute between the person who sought the service and the migration agent. We need a system in the department to monitor these things. Unless members of parliament in particular who deal with so many migration cases feel confident that they can report these cases to some departmental official to be dealt with in a professional way and confidentially then this system is going to get into more trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the committee leaves it open. They say that the scheme has benefits and I agree the scheme does have benefits. They also say that there are still continuing reports of abuse of the system, even from some of the agents that are registered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of other matters. Where we have picked up a case where somebody is in contravention of the law, where they have actually acted as an agent and have taken money without being registered, what are we doing? I do not know. Are we doing anything? What is the answer to that question? Has anybody been charged? If somebody has been charged, is the penalty just a couple of hundred dollars? Or is there a significant deterrent to make sure that if somebody is unregistered and is taking money for giving immigration advice then they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2332"> are clearly against the law and they ought to be dealt with. We need to hear from the department and from the government about what is happening in relation to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, the act makes a distinction between those people who actually charge and the non&hyphen;fee charging migration agents, that is, those who are attached to migrant resource centres and other such bodies, and community representatives&mdash;people who are doing this as a service, without any charge. Those people need to be given more support by the department. I am talking particularly about people attached to migrant resource centres, who are actually doing a great job in helping people fill in forms and all the rest of it. These people are individually held quite responsible for what they do under the act and yet they do not get any payment. So we ought to be giving them maximum support through the department in terms of materials, advice and even a kind of training from time to time, to ensure that they are kept up to date about the latest developments in immigration law. In my opinion, these non&hyphen;fee charging migration agents ought to be encouraged and they ought to be supported by additional services from the department, and certainly they ought to be given the most up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), made some important comments about the general immigration issues in this country at the moment. In particular he made some important comments about the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> entitled `Attitudes to Immigration'. He said that although immigration is not at the lowest point that it has been at in the last few years, it is still relatively low compared to previous periods. It is interesting that there is this perception in the community that immigration is high. This is a perception which is based partly on the fact that governments, including, I might say, the former Labor government, have not gone out and publicised the actual situation of immigration sufficiently. There is so much misunderstanding about immigration in terms of its nature and function and in terms of the way it is operating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People still think that people can come into this country without going through a points system. You go into the hotels and other places, and I am sure you have heard of it, Mr Deputy Speaker, and people say, `Oh, you are letting in this group or that group of people without any checks. They can come, but my brother&hyphen;in&hyphen;law can't come.' Every time it affects them, they say, `Oh, this other group can come, but my brother&hyphen;in&hyphen;law can't come.' There is so much misunderstanding. As the honourable member for Dunkley mentioned, the biggest group in his electorate is the migrants from the British Isles and Ireland. That is actually still the fact of the matter, that the biggest single national group is from the British Isles, and yet you would not think so if you heard the prejudices coming out about immigration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important that we have a bipartisan or responsible attitude in this matter and take an approach which is in the national interest. It is also important that we have a reasonable level of immigration continuing without increasing hostility&mdash;created, I might say, by massively irresponsible reporting by the media on this issue and on the other issue mentioned by the shadow minister, the multicultural policy, where I think the Australian media's activities are just outrageous in terms of creating mythology and putting forth not facts but individualised stories that back up prejudices, the kind of prejudices that I referred to before which are not based on fact. But I do not want to go into a general debate on this matter today; I just want to support the general thrust of the comments of the shadow minister in relation to this question.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2333">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that I support the migration scheme and I support the bill, but I urge the government to take up the issues which I have raised. We will be looking more critically at the performance of this program and I think that it is in the interests of all of us&mdash;this is not a partisan political point&mdash;to ensure that the scheme operates well and that it does not rip off people, especially when migration agents are receiving fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of fees, there ought to be more consistency in relation to this matter. There are some recommendations, but I am not sure that there has been sufficient monitoring to show whether people are sticking to recommendations about fee levels. We ought to look at that before we move along any path towards so&hyphen;called self&hyphen;regulation. If in recent times the agents have not been moderate in their fee charging, then perhaps we ought to be considering further forms of regulation, rather than talking about self&hyphen;regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The criteria for becoming a migration agent are not too tough. A wide range of people are able to apply. From that point of view, if people are going to be registered, then they ought to be professional in their attitude and we ought to keep in place the controls we have, and even introduce other controls if the scheme is not operating properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally, we support the idea of the registration of migration agents. We think the program should continue. Whatever faults are in it, we should act, especially in the next year during the period of review, to find what they are and to make sure that we make the scheme better for the Australian people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Deakin)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.29 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) for his endorsement of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. I know that, with his Greek heritage, the issues affecting immigrants to this country are very close to his heart, as they are to all responsible Australians and parliamentarians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the federal member representing an electorate as culturally diverse as Deakin in Melbourne's east, it gives me great pleasure to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. The bill deals directly with the responsibility of any truly civilised government towards the most vulnerable members of our society. It is about protecting future residents and citizens of Australia from the unscrupulous&mdash;people who, under the guise of granting access to a future in our country, feed themselves off the despair of migration applicants. These people know that immigration applicants look to Australia as a place to fulfil their dreams and ambitions&mdash;both their own and those of their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is still an immigrant's dream, a country which is seen as just and democratic. Because of this reputation, it is often assumed that people from this country are trustworthy&mdash;that they will treat immigrants with the same degree of fairness with which they themselves are treated in Australian society. Regrettably, this is not always the case. There is no doubt that we have a responsibility to deal fairly not only with residents of Australia but also with anyone who deals with our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And it is true that the questionable acts of a few should not reflect negatively on the entire society. The harsh reality of international relations is that they often do. A nation that allows those applying for permanent residency to be treated less than fairly must be held responsible. It is up to the parliamentarians of that country to legislate to stamp out such abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, I would expect Deakin's many ethnic communities to hold me personally responsible if I were not to raise my voice in support of the basic human rights of those applying to come to this country. This bill is of particular relevance to the people of my electorate; people who are, in ever increasing numbers, Australians born in non&hyphen;English <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2334"> speaking countries. Of the 24,000 overseas&hyphen;born residents of my electorate, the bulk of the most recent arrivals are from non&hyphen;English speaking countries such as China and Vietnam. In 15 per cent of Deakin homes, a language other than English is spoken. These are people whose limited command of the English language would have left them particularly vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous agents when emigrating to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate we have a number of bodies that have been set up to help our immigrants, bodies such as the community council on ethnic issues, migrant resource centres and migrant settlement committees. These particular bodies are working to help newly arrived immigrants settle into our country and to provide the support and service which they deserve. I support the honourable member for Calwell's comments in regard to some of the work of these bodies and we should continue to keep a close eye on their operations and see that they are helping those that they are meant to help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1995&hyphen;96 migration program provides for over 58,000 places for family migrants, 23,000 places for skilled migrants and 1,200 places for special eligibility migrants. If we consider the prices many migration agents charge for assistance&mdash;and the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable?: the Migration Agents Registration Scheme</EMPHASIS> makes ample mention of this&mdash;we see the emergence of a thriving, migration related industry. This in itself is not a bad thing. Prospective immigrants are free to avail themselves of the services of such agents. It is important, however, that the industry is carefully supervised and I believe that the extension of the migration agents registration scheme for another year provides the industry with a regulatory framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the 1995 report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration reveals, there have been cases of abuse and deception in the past. There have been instances in which people have been led to believe that the migration agent has a degree of influence with immigration officials, or that the agent can in some way guarantee the success of one applicant over another&mdash;something, of course, which is simply misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995 the committee also came to the conclusion that the migration advice industry was still developing. This is understandable. We are certainly not in the business of denying professional and responsible operators providing advice for a fee the opportunity to assist those either unwilling or unable to approach the bureaucratic complexities of the application. However, it is vital that this industry, like all industries of this sort, create a code of conduct, a type of regulatory structure, with which it can safeguard those who ask for their services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To extend the migration agents registration scheme to 21 September 1997 means having the opportunity of examining thoroughly the 1995 recommendations of the committee. We must strive to investigate and review these recommendations in a way that will leave no room for the exploitation of those seeking to migrate to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preference from my perspective is that the government should be taking a close monitoring role on whether or not these groups can self&hyphen;regulate. There are many other groups in our society, professional groups and agencies, that do have good self&hyphen;regulatory schemes in operation. I belong to the Australian Psychological Council which, while it is covered by legislation, also has a code of conduct which regulates the profession. It is preferable to go down this way but the migration agents body must prove itself to be able to have strong control over its agents and members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many could argue that prospective immigrants should know better than to trust unscrupulous agents, but many immigrants come from countries where paying individuals for influence and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2335"> not merely for bureaucratic competence is the usual modus operandi. Language difficulties may lead them to believe that paying migration agents is the only option they have, and once again, that makes them vulnerable to exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is quite direct in its acknowledgment of the shortcomings of the scheme. Unfortunately, the scheme itself has not rid Australia of unscrupulous operators and has not adequately protected many immigrants. However, it seems to me that rather than scrapping the scheme we should develop ways of finetuning it. It can be improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the committee noted, the scheme is still in its infancy and has been subjected to a High Court challenge for a large part of its existence. It is vital that we stand behind the scheme throughout this embryonic stage and that we remain committed to the thrust of the scheme&mdash;the protection of the most vulnerable members of our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make no secret of the fact that when I arrived in Australia as a young child my family would have been easy prey to the most uncaring elements of our society. My parents were fortunate. They were lucky that they came to this country as sponsored immigrants and they received professional and courteous service in their migration to and settlement in this country. One expects the same level of professionalism, courtesy and faith to be given to newly arrived and prospective immigrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These immigrants do not fully comprehend the implications of not being able to speak the language of the country in which they live. It is about vulnerability and about having to trust the untrustworthy, simply because they have a better command of the English language. It has left new arrivals in Australia open to exploitation, with the opportunities to exploit being inversely proportionate to the level of integration in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members would know only too well the emotional frame of mind of those who come to our offices seeking assistance with immigration cases. The honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) rightly pointed out in his speech the amount of work that is required, and the honourable member for Calwell noted that we are beholden to keep a careful and watchful eye over the progress of these immigration cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the electorate of Deakin, such cases often take up a large part of our day's work. People tell us stories of families separated by bureaucratic difficulties; of husbands and wives spending years apart. Any member of parliament dealing with such cases would realise that such depth of despair brings with it the vain search for a miracle cure. If they are told that the antidote to their distress can be found and bought, of course they will do it, no matter what the price, no matter how reputable the people who present themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fully support the extension of the migration agents registration scheme, as does my government. I hope that we will be able to work methodically over the next year to make the scheme as efficient and fair as possible. If we find that self&hyphen;regulation is the answer, so be it. I have nothing against the principle of the government keeping its distance from such industries, but there must be an assurance that self&hyphen;regulation can provide Australian society with an ethical environment in which we all feel comfortable. If such self&hyphen;regulation proves to be premature, let us find other solutions to creating a mature and responsible immigration assistance program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I note the comments of the honourable member for Calwell in regard to the article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. I concur with him that some very disturbing elements of anti&hyphen;immigration attitudes permeate our society. I believe it is up to us as parliamentarians, as communicators within our electorates, to make sure that the lack of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2336"> understanding and the untruths that are peddled out there are countered and to make sure that people in our community realise the benefits that generations of immigrants have given to this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recent contributions&mdash;in regard to customs yesterday by the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), and on gun legislation on the previous day by the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Graeme Campbell)&mdash;have emphasised to the Australian parliament the lack of knowledge of a variety of sitting members with regard to rural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset of this debate it is necessary to indicate to those members, and even to a large number of urban members from outside Sydney and Melbourne, some of the realities that preface the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Atlas of the Australian People</EMPHASIS> makes a number of very important points about one of the major reasons for this legislation. It notes that in New South Wales, of the Arabic speaking background population, 14.8 per cent of males and 21.5 per cent of females do not speak English at all, or do not speak it very well. In the Turkish population, which is very prevalent in my electorate, 23.8 per cent of males and 32 per cent of females do not speak English at all, or not very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting in a number of municipalities in the inner west of Sydney the proportion in the population of non&hyphen;English speaking background people. In Auburn, 14.3 per cent of the population were born overseas. They are not the relatives of people born overseas; they were actually born overseas themselves in non&hyphen;English speaking countries. In Holroyd and Parramatta, the percentage is 4&half; per cent. There are now six municipalities in Sydney where over 10 per cent of the population were born in non&hyphen;English speaking countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, 23&half; per cent of those born overseas do not speak English very well, and 4&half; per cent do not speak it, full stop. It is also interesting to note that in the 1991 census as many as nine per cent of the population had been living in another country five years previously and, of the total population of those born overseas, 33 per cent were born in a non&hyphen;English speaking country. This is part of the background of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to have served on the joint migration committee over the last three years&mdash;I very much regret my inability to play a role in it in the next few years&mdash;and to have had the opportunity to participate in this inquiry. It is fair to say that there were differences of emphasis among the political parties on this matter. At the end of the day, a compromise was reached where the then opposition, despite their doubts about the effectiveness of the current migrant agents legislation, felt that it should be given an opportunity of a further few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I very much associate myself with this legislation and I think that it is very necessary. Its failings rest not with its being too stringent and too inclined to interfere but with a number of other problems. Firstly, it has had start&hyphen;up difficulties in its first few years in dealing with the issue of registration as such, without getting into the actual policing of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Secondly, I will indicate to some of the other members of this parliament the very different nature of representation in this country. Three of the four people in my office&mdash;including me&mdash;deal with migration all the time. One person on our staff does the rest of the work: Austudy, veterans affairs and unemployment benefits. So that is some indication of the kind of push factor in migration problems in a number of electorates in Sydney. I see the member for Fowler (Mr Grace) here; he would be in a similar situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think many of us have been guilty because, as lay people lacking a legal background, we see many cases relating to migration agents which we should perhaps refer to this board. I have referred one case involving a lawyer. But we often find that a case is borderline as to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2337"> whether a complaint would be successful. When it got down to the technicalities of evidence and the issues of fairness, it would be borderline whether at the end of the day you would be successful in getting something done about this person. But the reality out there in society is that there is a need for this kind of board, and that need has many characteristics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, as I have indicated, we have an increasing number of people of non&hyphen;English speaking background who do not speak English. As the previous speaker, the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) alluded to, the problem is that in many other societies there is a concept that you pay people, and you peddle influence, and you have to know a big&hyphen;shot around the place to get somewhere in the political system. In my own case&mdash;and I think other members have experienced this&mdash;I have found considerable difficulty in convincing migrant people that in this country essentially we operate by laws, by queues and by systems. And you can understand that when people go out to people in the private sector, they feel that it is the same system, that they have got to pay this guy to get somewhere in the process. They do not know what the rules are; they do not know what the system is, and they think that is the way it operates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, we have really got to look at the actual processing times in this country; the levels of appeal; the way in which they allow people to flout the system by spending years here getting points on the board to justify a long&hyphen;term stay here. I think that this is a very big problem. I hope that the new government does tackle it, and I think that more effort might have been made during the previous three to six years if there had been a political will in the government. Once again, this is an encouragement for people to use unscrupulous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all had experience of women coming in and saying that they have launched refugee cases on the basis that Tonga is a patriarchal society and so every female from Tonga should be allowed to stay here. We have had people claiming refugee status because they refused to marry the first person that they were sent out here from Syria to marry. I had one case like this last week. Essentially, the claim is on refugee&hyphen;humanitarian grounds&mdash;that if she went back to Syria she would be in such dire circumstances in relation to her family that she should be a refugee in this country. And it goes on and on. People are claiming that their cousin's brother&hyphen;in&hyphen;law's second cousin's mother&hyphen;in&hyphen;law was shot five years ago in Kabul and therefore the whole family has justifiable refugee claims in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the very concrete problems that this system has been set up to combat. There are people out there who lack skills; there are people out there who feel that you must pay to be in the system; there are people out there who very cynically seek to manipulate the system themselves. Let us be honest about it: many of these claimants are just as bad as the people who are operating as agents. They are here basically to exploit Australia's loopholes&mdash;to exploit Australia's adherence to international conventions&mdash;when they have no justifiable claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are reasons why this system operates. If you read the evidence you will see much reference made to a Springvale community group. Quite frankly, the reference made to those people is indicative of the fact that they were perhaps the only group that came before the committee with any vocal, persistent criticism of the way the system was operating, from the point of view of not cleaning it up. Even they, under cross&hyphen;examination, indicated that, whilst they thought there were failures, whilst from their point of view there might have been discouragement of community workers becoming registered, at the end of the day registration, government intervention and assurance were preferable to nothing at all.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2338">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth citing some of the evidence that the committee received. On page 53 of the report, at paragraph 3.53, it noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A common theme in submissions was that regulation of the migration advice industry is necessary to ensure consumer protection and the maintenance of appropriate standards within the industry. IARC, for example commented:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a regulatory scheme is necessary to support the reputable people working in this area as well as to eradicate the unscrupulous and incompetent operators.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, at paragraph 3.54, it noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some submissions, it was argued that regulation of migration advisers is required because of the vulnerability of persons seeking immigration advice.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . immigration is a field which has some unique features which merit special regulation in that the client base is, more often than not, in a particularly vulnerable position and this is the case even with clients who can speak English fluently and are highly educated.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know that up until the Cunliffe case the Law Council of Australia wanted to make themselves special, privileged elements, as usual. The Law Council, at the end of the day, said, `Whilst you should not regulate us&mdash;the law profession&mdash;because we are so legitimate and trustworthy, you should regulate the others.' So, even from that source, we had an admission that there are major problems in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need for government intervention, because people are so vulnerable and because the industry attracts the possibility of making quick bucks from people who have no base on which to compare fees. Further, at page 55, our report noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commenting on the experience of its members since the enactment of the Scheme, the IRT&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Immigration Review Tribunal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the quality of advice provided by applicants remains very poor. Many agents are ignorant of the regulations, including those applying to review. Often the written submissions we get are little more than legal nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA>I can certainly confirm that from many that I have read. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We continue to see applications lodged through agents which are fatally flawed and therefore doomed to fail.</PARA>
<PARA>Essentially, these people do not care whether they are going to fail. They advertise in a particular ethnic publication or series of publications in that community; they have a few people out there pushing their barrow, probably getting a retainer, saying that they are the best person around the place; they win a minority of cases; people talk to their family and friends about the minority of cases; and they are still in business, regardless of their inability to actually function in the system properly and despite the fact that they know that many of their cases are beaten before they start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At page 61, 3.82, it is noted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statistics obtained by the Committee support a finding that the achievements of the Scheme relevant to its objectives have been chequered. On the positive side, around 600 persons either have been denied the right to practise as migration agents or have decided to withdraw from seeking entry to the industry. In addition, the avenues for developing expertise in migration law have increased noticeably, with various courses and seminars now being conducted at a tertiary level and within the industry itself.</PARA>
<PARA>We summed up the situation after speaking to the vast majority of people who make up the industry, including reputable agents, community groups, volunteers, people involved from the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2339"> legal side of migration, the IRT and the registration board itself. The summary of the situation was that, despite problems, the system was essentially doing something. People have been de&hyphen;registered, people have been stopped from entering the field and, more importantly, a large number of people have had second thoughts about trying to get registered when they have seen other people failing. They know that they are probably going to attract attention to themselves by their attempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee made a number of recommendations for the future. It is worth while noting, when we speculate about the possibility that this industry can regulate itself, its abysmal performance in setting up internal training schemes before this board got off the ground. We now can talk about a variety of courses in universities and in colleges. I have to say that that has been a very big advance, but the sad reality is that when these people had the choice themselves, without government intervention and without oversight from this parliament and the joint migration committee, they were not capable of doing anything at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee did say that the board should look towards the development of a training module to assist non fee charging organisations, which do not qualify for organisation based registration. There was a suggestion by the committee that we revisit the schedule of registration fees. It is quite clear that the original intent to help country areas by a scheme of fees which gave leeway to those people who are doing less than five cases a year has been widely abused. There were some statistics saying that there had been a very pronounced tendency for people to seek registration under that lower level of fees. In fact, as of June 1994, 39 per cent of agents had used the concessional option, 33 per cent were paying nothing at all, and only 28 per cent were paying full fees. There was a suggestion by the committee that we look at the fee schedule to overcome that abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, there was also a suggestion that the board be pro&hyphen;active in advertising to the ethnic community the nature of the registration process as to the oversight that is here in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is made&mdash;in recommendation 47&mdash;that the Migration Agents Registration Board, if it has got any failings, lacks power or lacks teeth and that the number of sanctions that it can apply to the industry should be widened.The committee unanimously came forward with 49 recommendations all told. To my mind they essentially are going in the right direction to try and ensure that this industry is policed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I reiterate that this industry, more than most, is not capable of self&hyphen;regulation. It has a sorry history of abuse of the system. It has a sorry history of exploitation. There have been attempts to inaugurate cases that have no chance whatsoever in the system, essentially aimed at delaying people's deportation from the country and at increasing the agent's image in a variety of ethnic communities, thus engendering more business. It is a system that exploits the most vulnerable people who feel that they have no other options. I commend the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill, I say not only that the legislation is very necessary but also that without it it is very difficult to see how we can have an intelligent migration program in this country. I come at the issue from an entirely different viewpoint from those of the big cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra have a lovely little map out which says, `We cover 95 per cent of the population with our mobile telephones.' If you get out a compass and protractor and work out the area of land that is covered, it works out to somewhat less than five per cent of the surface area <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2340"> of this country. In one recent initiative we looked at the seven major federal electorates that cover 82 per cent of the Australian land mass and the population, just shaving off some of the edges. For example, in my own electorate, by shaving off the coastal part of that electorate the land mass is still maintained, with just a tiny narrow strip that, of course, contains half the population of the electorate of Kennedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By just cutting off those narrow coastal strips you come up with a map that looks very much like the map of Australia. It is just shorn of the coastal edges&mdash;and, albeit, a fair proportion of Victoria. But it is 82 per cent of the surface area of this country and it is occupied by some four per cent of the Australian population. But, if you use the Telstra analysis, you end up with 95 per cent of the surface area of the country occupied by 95 per cent of the population. So this is the most congested land on earth&mdash;the population of Australia is in the most congested land on earth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original Australian population did not go to the seas. The original Australian population, the vast bulk of the people now known as Australians&mdash;3&half; million of them, if you like; most certainly two million of them&mdash;came here during the mining boom. They all went to the mining fields of Australia and then tried to make a living contracting, farming and in various other pastoral pursuits. So I think the migration debate is most relevant to the demographic problems of Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go back to the map of Australia, with some 90 per cent of the continent being occupied by only about four per cent of the population. People say that it is all desert. I am sad to say that that is a flagrant lie. If you get in an aeroplane at Ingham or Innisfail in North Queensland and fly in that aeroplane in a westerly direction, for about 30 kilometres you will go through a very intensely populated area. Then it will be very doubtful whether you will see from that aeroplane any sign of human habitation for the next 10,000 kilometres. It is empty; there is nobody living there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who say that it is a wasteland, that it is desert, let me say that you would have just flown over 75 per cent of Australia's entire rainfall run&hyphen;off. In fact, the first river you will fly across is the Mitchell River, which is the second biggest river in Australia&mdash;second to the Murray. Along the Mitchell River it is all flat farming country. It is a very long river, running for some 600&mdash;arguably, 700&mdash;kilometres. I would argue that the vast bulk of it is farming land. And, to my knowledge, there are not even any station properties that water their cattle there. Not only are there no farms, but even the grazing industry does not use that resource because of the prevalence of crocodiles and the dangers that involves and also because of the mud problems that can lead to cattle getting bogged in poor times and dying there. So most of the river is fenced off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, you will have flown over 75 per cent of Australia's entire water resources. I make the point that that is not east of the coastal divide; it is not in the high rainfall areas of North Queensland&mdash;the super wet belt. I am talking about the other side of the Great Divide that contains 75 per cent of Australia's rainfall run&hyphen;off. I think the Ord River in Western Australia is the third or fourth biggest river in Australia. So you would have flown over the second and third biggest rivers in Australia. And in relation to the land itself, in that 90 per cent or so of the continent I am referring to, some 70 per cent of the Australia's arable land is in that part of Australia that is totally unpopulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons that land is unoccupied at the present moment is that we are on a down cycle because the population in western and inland towns in Australia has been declining. Let <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2341"> me take the example of western Queensland. The figures do not encompass the south&hyphen;west&mdash;which has probably been hit worse than the central west and the mid&hyphen;west, which is to outsiders the north&hyphen;west of Queensland. In the north&hyphen;west and central west of the state, our average population losses over the last 25 years are in excess of 38 per cent for all those shires. In other words, 40 per cent of the population of inland Australia has left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rate at which the population is leaving has increased and is increasing. The rate at which we are depopulating all of the land mass of Australia is rapidly increasing. Not only does that impose immense problems in the outback but it also imposes immense strain upon governments which have to provide extra services and facilities in the already overcrowded cities of Australia. If we were able to get people to move back there, the cost of providing infrastructure would be negligible because the infrastructure was put there for populations twice the size of today's population. The cost of putting people on the ground out there is absolutely negligible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to the legislation before us today. Let me take the example of a town like Aramac: it has lost more than half its population. Some 20 years ago, it was twice as big as it is today. It does not have a doctor. For any government to say that it is not allowed to have a doctor is not only improper but also the very antithesis of good government. People will die in the Aramac&hyphen;Muttaburra area because they do not have a resident doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the present moment, we can ring up a migration agent and get the agent to deliver a doctor to us. By the time I make this speech, I hope that has, in fact, happened. If it has not happened, I hope it is in the process of happening. Without the migration agent we would have enormous difficulties. In fact, at one stage in the mid&hyphen;west region of North Queensland, we were down three doctors and the health department blithely told us continually that it could not secure doctors for us. In fairness to it, in those days there were no migration agents; we could not ring anyone and ask them to send us a doctor. Since the migration agents have come into existence, we have someone to ring: we can ask them to send us a doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This marvellous facility of migration agents which now exists is being crippled. I must pay some tribute to Al Grassby because he coined the phrase `demographic immigration'. He put forward a very important concept. Sadly, his actions in government did not meet his rhetoric. There was a huge gulf between what he promised and what he delivered. Unfortunately, he paid the political price for that. Let us remember his good point, his coining of the phrase `demographic immigration'. He said that whilst there are parts of Australia where immigration may be a mixed blessing there are parts of Australia that desperately need those migrants. In fact, in parts of Australia people will die because of the present immigration laws in Australia that prevent us from getting a doctor to come to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst undoubtedly the government has the right to say who can and who cannot come into Australia, we say to the government of Australia that if we ring a migration agent and he says, `We have a doctor who is prepared to go to Aramac', you have no right to say to us that we cannot have that doctor come into this country. If you say that to us then let the death of people be upon your conscience. Let me actually quote the figure. Without a resident doctor, every two years one person will die who would not have died had we had a resident doctor for every 1,000 people in a community. In the Aramac&hyphen;Muttaburra area we still have 1,000 people, so every two years the government can take upon its conscience the death of some person because of laws which are totally inappropriate to the problems that exist today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I have chosen the example of a doctor, in places like Cloncurry the temperature can reach 126 degrees Fahrenheit during summer months: that is indoors. Ground temperatures <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2342"> can reach close to 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In these places, which are some of the hottest places on earth, an airconditioner is not a luxury, it is an absolute necessity. If we have not got a refrigeration mechanic or an airconditioning mechanic to repair our refrigerators or our airconditioners then we are in very desperate trouble. We need plumbers, we need steel fabricators, we need TV repairmen, we need auto&hyphen;electricians and in some towns we need electricians and mechanics for our cars. We have none of these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present rules really prevent us from bringing these people into Australia. If the rules say we have too many electricians in Australia I accept those rules. But if we have advertised in the paper and we cannot get an electrician to go to Julia Creek or to Blackall or Barcaldine or Muttaburra then I say, once again, that the rules must be changed. If we were to modify them so that a person could agree to go to that place for some two or three years and then earn the right to become a permanent Australian citizen and go where he likes I think that they would be very good rules. If a person has lived in a community such as Julia Creek for two years and he has made his home and his friends there he tends to stay there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The immigration department provides us with one of the great answers to one of the saddest occurrences in Australian life today. This country was culturally and economically born in these outback areas. In fact I have the great privilege of representing in the federal parliament Winton, the place where Qantas was founded, and Cloncurry, where our most famous Australian song <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS> was written. The Labor movement, which even for people on my side of the House was one of the greatest contributors to the nation as we know it today, was also founded in the Blackall&hyphen;Barcaldine area. Many good things in this nation today come from outback North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very heartland of this nation's identity is being made bereft of Australians and those that are living there are being forced out at a great and increasingly greater speed. People do not want to stay there because life is so harsh and it is almost impossible to get a refrigerator or a motor car fixed on a station property. Even to get plumbing done on a station property these days is very difficult. Probably 100 towns in my electorate are bereft of all of the services which we take for granted if we live in a city or even in a coastal town. Plumbers, electricians and refrigeration and airconditioning mechanics are normal everyday services without which society cannot continue to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a provision which I applaud where 100 people are allowed into Australia under a trial program called the regional migration scheme. It is an excellent scheme but it badly needs to be changed in a number of ways. The most important way it needs to be changed is that there must be a job for these people to go to. It does not allow them to purchase a business and go to where that business is. It does not allow them to set up a new business in these areas. Let us take the example of an auto&hyphen;electrician in a town like Hughenden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no garage in Hughenden that is big enough to employ an auto&hyphen;electrician. But the two, three or four garages in the area would, between them, greatly appreciate the services of an auto&hyphen;electrician. It may be that Hughenden has secured the services of an auto&hyphen;electrician&mdash;but I know that in years past we had grave difficulty trying to secure an auto&hyphen;electrician for that town. There is no&hyphen;one there big enough to employ him, but collectively there is probably the work for two or three auto&hyphen;electricians in that town. So the scheme is really of very limited value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are so small in so many towns now that nobody employs anyone. There is no such thing as an employee; they do not exist any more. There are only self&hyphen;employed people in these <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2343"> towns and the regional migration scheme does not presently allow for self&hyphen;employed people to come into the country. So the public servants, the ministers and governmental people who have been involved in bringing this scheme forward have done a very great and laudable job for their country. We have tried it out and realise now that it should be extended in certain areas and that self&hyphen;employment is a provision that must be included in modifications to this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The migration agents are vitally important to the scheme because obviously the people in Aramac or Muttaburra or Blackall have not got access to securing people from overseas. It would be hopeless if they had to chase those people overseas themselves. They desperately need the migration agents as an integral part of any program of repopulating our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another point I wish to make about the regional migration scheme. If the government is still worried about whether these people are going to stay there or take off, then if these people buy a business or a house in these towns clearly they are showing a great commitment. It is very difficult to sell a business or a house from these towns. So if people still feel strongly that we should not widen the regional migration scheme, if you put that provision in that surely would guarantee that these people would stay there for a certain period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We allow millions of people to come into this country every year under certain terms and conditions, such as holiday and visa arrangements of various types. If you say to me that we cannot allow these people to come into the country as migrants under this condition because they might just leave Julia Creek and go to Brisbane and then we would not be able to find them, I say that you are letting three, four or five million people into this country every year under conditions which you cannot possibly police. Exactly the same argument applies to the person here on a holiday visa: he can decide to just live permanently in Brisbane and you cannot get rid of him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, surely, it is untenable to use that argument against allowing a thousand or two thousand families into Australia each year under a widened regional migration scheme such as I am putting forward here because you are allowing not two or three thousand but five or six million people into the country every year and taking a risk with them. So why not take the risk where there is great social benefit to Australia via a regional migration scheme?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to say that we need a great widening of the regional migration scheme to allow for self&hyphen;employed people to come in and a lowering of the conditions under which they are allowed into the country at present, vastly freeing up and liberalising those conditions. We need to keep migration agents. The alternative is to watch Australia become less and less populated and the great resources that God has given to all of us not being utilised at all. We have no moral right to hold on to land that we are not using. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my task to sum up the debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, in the absence of the minister, Mr Ruddock, who is otherwise engaged in the cabinet. Whilst I had a reasonably busy diary this morning, I am very glad he did ask me to perform this task on his behalf because, having sat here for the last 40 minutes or so, I have been fascinated to hear the different perspectives on immigration from different members of the House of Representatives. One perspective was that of Mr Ferguson, the member for Reid, who represents, as I do, a very urban part of this country. Another was that of my friend Mr Katter, the member for Kennedy, who represents the opposite end of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2344"> spectrum and perhaps the most regional or rural electorate in the country. It was interesting to hear the different perspectives and the different values that they brought to this debate on behalf of their constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate has also brought out a fundamental difference in philosophies between the two sides of our parliament&mdash;the government and the opposition. When my friend the member for Reid talked about self&hyphen;regulation as it applies to the migration agents registration scheme, MARS, and his doubts about the efficacy of it, it struck me once again that you find distilled in the forums of this parliament this fundamental philosophical difference between the two sides. But, that said, something the government welcomes in particular is the atmosphere of bipartisanship that applies to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Denison (Mr Kerr), the shadow minister, who has been aggressive in his criticism of the government in recent times, has shown a very welcome change of attitude in joining with us in dealing with this bill. It is no surprise to me, as a member representing a Sydney electorate and an habitual reader of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> who has read the details of the survey published there this morning&mdash;parts of which I must admit I found disappointing. But it is worth reflecting for a little while on the history of political debate about immigration in English speaking democracies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first instance I came across, in a history of British politics in the first decade of this century, was in reading of an election campaign that took place in 1905. The Conservative or Unionist Prime Minister Arthur Balfour was opposed by Campbell&hyphen;Bannerman and, more particularly, by David Lloyd George of the British Liberal Party. During that campaign, the issue of Chinese labour being used in the mines of South Africa arose. David Lloyd George went to great lengths in parts of middle&hyphen;England to beat up the notion that some of this Chinese labour might be imported to work in the coal mines and tin mines of Wales and therefore would put good, solid Welsh miners out of a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is sad to note that David Lloyd George and his colleagues won that election, not perhaps specifically on that issue. But that is the first time I can recall the issue being raised of foreign immigration and the doubts in the electorate about its impact on employment&mdash;and, as has been the case lately in Australia, on the environment. Thank God, in this country we have strong bipartisanship on this issue, and I hope that that forever obtains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) raised the issue of whether or not the existing scheme and the complaints and investigatory mechanisms under it were tough enough. He pointed out that, in his view, there had not been enough people excluded from registration or deregistered. I understand that history shows that, of 2,000 registered migration agents in the country at the present time, in the past over 400 unsuitable applicants have been excluded by the board. But this really leads to the fundamental question of whether or not self&hyphen;regulation is the way to go with this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Reid was particularly critical of the approach to the registration of migration agents. I think he quoted from the report of the joint committee, saying that there was something special, something particularly vulnerable, about the client base with which this mechanism of registration deals. That is to say that people who have poor English skills, and who in most cases have very low incomes, fall prey very easily to unscrupulous advisers, registered or not, and that therefore there is some urgent need for government supervision in this area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2345">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This set me thinking about my own electorate, where I have a number of different ethnic communities. The biggest one is the Jewish community, which has seen a lot of immigration from parts of the old Soviet Union in recent years. I have watched how they deal with their community and the needs of their own immigrants, potential and otherwise. They apply severe scrutiny to the immigration advisers to whom the relatives of potential immigrants would apply for help. If they find that there is villainy afoot or that someone is misbehaving they are very quick to make sure that that person is shunned or ostracised and that the word goes around the community that such a person should not be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This struck me as perhaps the most efficacious approach. If we go too far down the road of government supervision, interference and regulation in this area then you diminish the need for personal effort on behalf of these particular ethnic communities who want to see more immigration of their own folk. The government cannot see, for the moment, any reason to give up on the capacity of these ethnic groups to do something about these problems themselves, rather than engage the federal government to do it on their behalf. That gives some idea of the philosophical approach to self&hyphen;regulation that obtains in the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most interesting perspective in the debate, and one that I had not heard before, was that given by the honourable member for Kennedy. He began by describing the geographical reality of his electorate and making the little known point that the second highest area of rainfall run&hyphen;off in Australia is inland from Ingham. When school children in Australia are asked the simple question, `Which town has the highest rainfall in Australia?' most of the well&hyphen;informed ones answer `Tully'. It is Tully, but the consequence of the run&hyphen;off of that rainfall&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FB6">Mr ANDREW THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have more to learn then. Naturally, the consequence of heavy rainfall is heavy run&hyphen;off, and that falls inland. But more especially, he made the point that inland Australia has suffered the depletion of 40 per cent of its population in the postwar period, and that much of the opinion that is distilled and broadcast or printed in our news media is formed in the cities&mdash;the urban areas of Australia. This is something that is overlooked. Many in the news media, and certainly in a malevolent sense&mdash;let me be blunt&mdash;often cast people of inland Australia as somehow xenophobic or instinctively resentful of foreign things, and certainly of foreign immigration.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Grassby's multisyllabic phrase `demographic immigration' is probably best summed up, in the sort of language that a member of the House of Representatives uses in his or her travels, as `what you need is more of a fair go in terms of the immigration program.' The government, in the famous phrase of Sir Humphrey's, is fully seized of that. I will make sure that on the next occasion I have to discuss these matters with the minister, Mr Ruddock, I put that point to him privately, but as forcefully, perhaps, as the member for Kennedy did in his contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum up the essential points, the government welcomes the opposition's contribution to this debate. It welcomes in particular the bipartisanship that has obtained and continues to obtain about immigration matters. We reiterate our desire for an approach of self&hyphen;regulation, or enhanced self&hyphen;regulation, to this type of scheme. But we will not hurry to do this. In most things&mdash;whether it is a decision of the cabinet or whether it is hitting a golf ball&mdash;if it is done too quickly, it is usually done very badly. There are many proverbs, metaphors, whatever you like, to illustrate that important point&mdash;that, if you do something too quickly, you usually muck it up. There is an urgent need, as the gentleman from Kennedy has pointed out, for this to be dealt with efficaciously. As soon as I can find the minister, I will make that point to him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the opposition does not oppose this measure. It arises as a consequence of a decision by the government to change the salary structure for ministers, legislation to achieve which has already been passed. Due to the design of the superannuation arrangements for Commonwealth parliamentarians, cutting the existing salaries of non&hyphen;cabinet ministers would impact on the superannuation pensions of some existing parliamentary superannuants and also on the entitlements of some current members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction would arise for current superannuants with non&hyphen;cabinet ministerial experience because the superannuants are paid with reference to their past service and also to the current salary levels that are applicable to that service. There would, therefore, be a reduction in pension payment from the pre 2 May level, which would continue until such time as, if ever, non&hyphen;cabinet ministers' salary increased back to the pre 2 May level. Similarly, the value of the superannuation entitlements of current members with non&hyphen;cabinet ministerial experience would be reduced should they retire or die prior to the non&hyphen;cabinet ministerial salary again returning to the pre 2 May level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill proposes to insulate existing superannuants from the effects of the salary reduction basically by maintaining current pension payments and maintaining the value of the superannuation entitlements of existing members by ensuring that the formula remains as it previously was. In short, there is a general principle, accepted by all governments, that changes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2347"> to superannuation should `grandfather' existing recipients. Adherence to that principle simply means that the rules should not be changed retrospectively to the detriment of superannuants. This legislation abides by that principle, and for this reason the opposition does not oppose it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation is a matter of equity, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). It precludes a retrospective diminution in benefits already accrued to retired and serving members of parliament. The existing provisions of the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act base retiring allowances&mdash;that is, parliamentary pensions&mdash;on the salaries payable from time to time for parliamentary service and in respect of offices held as ministers of state and other office holders of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction in salary for non&hyphen;cabinet ministers, which came into effect on 11 March this year, would have had two effects. First, it would have reduced some pensions payable to former coalition and opposition members&mdash;or to widows or widowers of former members&mdash;who had been non&hyphen;cabinet ministers. Second, it would have reduced accrued benefits of some coalition and opposition members who previously had had non&hyphen;cabinet ministerial service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will prevent those reductions by freezing the benefit levels at pre&hyphen;reduction levels. Once the salaries of non&hyphen;cabinet ministers increase and overtake pre&hyphen;reduction salaries, benefits will be increased in line with future salary increases. Similarly, the bill would also prevent any reductions in members' accrued superannuation benefits if the salaries on which the accrued benefits are based were to decrease in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prevention of a reduction in accrued superannuation benefits is consistent with the intent of the superannuation regulatory legislation. As I said at the outset, this is a matter of equity for former members of parliament and current members of parliament who have served in ministerial but non&hyphen;cabinet positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the desire of the government to indicate through its principal decision in relation to what may be regarded as two tiers of ministerial salaries that the salaries paid to cabinet ministers be of a higher level than the salaries paid to non&hyphen;cabinet ministers. If this piece of legislation had not been passed it would have had adverse consequences on the financial arrangements with respect to superannuation and pensions for those former members of the ministry who were not members of the cabinet. Therefore, there is a real question of equity so far as this legislation is concerned. It is because of the matter of equity that the legislation has been brought in by my colleague the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), whom I am glad to see here. The government is pleased with the opposition's wholehearted support for this measure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) has explained, the catalyst for this legislation is the government's decision to reduce the salaries of the 13 so&hyphen;called junior ministers by $10,000 each per annum. The consequence of that would have been that the superannuation entitlements of previous ministers, because they are tied to salaries paid to present ministers, would have been reduced commensurately. I support this legislation, if not for any other reason than that if it is not passed it will superimpose, retrospectively, a penalty on previous ministers. I have always been consistent in my very vocal and dedicated opposition to retrospective measures which impose penalties, burdens or other imposts having retrospective effect. The legislation, in my view, is absolutely necessary. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2348">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for our talking about it at all is that it arose out of the decision of the government, very early in its term of office, to announce this salary reduction. It was purely and simply a public relations exercise, one which has failed miserably. There is not one elector out there who remembers and, because no&hyphen;one remembers, I think it can fairly be said to be the thoughtless action of a new and zealous cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than that, it overrides the findings and decisions of the Parliamentary Remuneration Tribunal. The consequence of that for every parliamentarian is that, on the very next occasion that that tribunal ordains that we are entitled to some sort of a salary increase or increment in our allowances, we will be obliged to defend the decision of such a tribunal and thereby be prevented from doing the jobs we were elected to do. We will be put in a position where we have to defend the findings of an independent body established specifically for the purpose of taking the heat out of the question of parliamentary salaries and allowances. It was a foolish decision for that reason as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The actual savings to be obtained by the government involve 13 so&hyphen;called junior ministers at $10,000 per annum&mdash;a gross of $130,000 per annum. If the tax of $63,700 on that at a marginal rate is taken out, plus the Medicare levy of 49 cents in the dollar and the 11 or 12 per cent that the ministers would have had to pay out of the $10,000 had it not been removed from their entitlement, the amount is something in the vicinity of $60,000 or $70,000 per annum. That decision smacks of populism at its worst.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the reasons I have already enunciated, it is hardly worth the candle. It is the decision of a small&hyphen;minded, penny&hyphen;pinching cabinet which has given it no serious thought, other than the fact that it might be a very popular decision. There can be no other reason for it. It is going to make no contribution whatsoever to the $8 billion Beazley black hole that the government likes to claim as justification for&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do, I am afraid. I am sorry to disappoint you, my friend. I do believe it. To suggest that whatever their salary was before the reduction of $10,000 each was too much is absolute rubbish, in the opinion of most people in the community. Most fair&hyphen;minded people in the community do not jib at ministers getting fair remuneration, any more than they jib at members of parliament getting fair and reasonable remuneration. The dedicated few out there will jump on to these decisions and we will be faced with having to defend a decision taken in haste, thoughtlessly, and with a view to garnering some sort of adulation from the masses, adulation which simply is not forthcoming and never was going to be forthcoming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I say to the Minister for Finance that, whilst this legislation is necessary as a consequence of that decision, it was a stupid decision and one that I hope is never repeated. This legislation has a one&hyphen;off effect, as we know, because it only applies to the salaries of those 13 ministers. In the future, if you want to do something along those lines, you are going to have to go through the whole exercise again. But I hope you do not bother. I hope you would give it away, because you have won no medals whatsoever out there. The savings involved are petty, the decision itself was petty and the motivation for it, as far as I can see, was unworthy of a new government setting out to do the difficult things and tackle the difficult areas of spending where big money is involved.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank honourable members for their contributions to this debate. In closing debate on the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Bill, I simply wish to reiterate what I stated earlier <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2349"> in the debate: that the reduction in salary for non&hyphen;cabinet ministers would have had unintended consequences. It would have had an effect of reducing the pensions payable to certain former coalition and ALP members who had been non&hyphen;cabinet ministers, or, where they had died, to their widows. The accrued benefits of some serving members from both sides of politics who previously had non&hyphen;cabinet ministerial service would have been reduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will prevent these reductions by freezing the benefit levels until the actual salary payable to non&hyphen;cabinet ministers overtakes the pre&hyphen;reduction salary. Benefits will then increase in line with future salary increases. Similarly, the bill would also prevent any future reductions in pensions and serving members' accrued benefits if the salaries on which those benefits are based were to decrease in the future. The amendments contained in the bill will maintain the level of expenditure on current pensions payable under the scheme.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1996 sets the scene for a cooperative approach to legislation in this parliament. The legislation before us today was initiated in the last parliament and was supported by the coalition at that time. Today we are honouring that support and invite the now opposition's continuing support of these amendments concerning investigative powers held by the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These powers permit the Health Insurance Commission to obtain information and conduct searches in order to monitor compliance with Medicare guidelines. They also enable the commission to execute search warrants and seize material for the purposes of evidence. The legislation will enable the continuation of these powers following the encouraging report that came from the Australian National Audit Office which was tabled in this place on 22 May. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Impact of sunset clause on investigatory powers follow-up audit</EMPHASIS> will confirm that the safety mechanisms employed by the HIC have ensured that powers have been used correctly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By repealing section 2 of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 and item 68 of schedule 1 of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995, this legislation will enable the Health Insurance Commission to continue to conduct investigations and prepare prosecutions against providers and requesting practitioners who do abuse the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 2 of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 specifically provides that the entire act should cease to have force on and from 1 July 1996. The sunset clause resulted from concerns expressed before the Senate Standing Committee </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2350">
<PARA>on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that the broad ranging powers provided for in the act offered scope for corruption and abuse of delegated authority by officers of the Health Insurance Commission. It allowed for a reasonable period of time, roughly two years, for parliament to make a considered judgment about whether the powers had been abused in any way by the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No evidence of improper activity by the Health Insurance Commission has arisen during this period. Moreover, the conferred powers have improved the commission's ability to effectively detect and deal with Medicare non-compliance and fraud. It is, therefore, important that those powers now be preserved in order to give full effect to the role and function of the Health Insurance Commission as a regulatory body over Medicare practices and fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, item 68 of schedule 1 of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995 provides that item 66 and the amendments made by item 66 of schedule 1 of that act cease to be in force from 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 66 ensures procedural fairness in relation to the seizure of evidential materials for the purposes of investigating Medicare fraud and overservicing. It does so by imposing an obligation on authorised officers or officers assisting the commission to return material seized for the purposes of evidence in the course of conducting searches and investigations when the reason warranting the seizure no longer exists or a decision is made not to use the material in evidence. The item, therefore, aims to protect the interests and privacy of a medical practitioner who may come under investigation for fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill establishes that certain measures should be kept in place to allow the continued control and enforcement of compliance with Medicare benefit guidelines. This bill aims to retain the delegation of powers which have proven, on a trial-like basis, to be efficient, substantive and pertinent to the role of the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of any evidence that the powers delegated by the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 have been or are prone to being abused and distorted, the sunset clause incorporated into that act should be repealed. In order to preserve a follow&hyphen;on provision in the interests of fairness and individuals' rights, the sunset clause incorporated into the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No.3) 1995 relating to item 66 should also be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without these amendments the sunset clause would take effect on 1 July 1996, thus seriously undermining the ability of the HIC to prevent, and prosecute against, Medicare fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to be able to advise you and the minister at the table that the opposition will support this legislation. As the minister has outlined, it is a package that seeks to remove a sunset clause that otherwise would take effect on 1 July l996. Any time sunset clauses are discussed, I am reminded of an incident that took place when the former Lord Mayor of Sydney was a candidate for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. As many of us have had to do when seeking preselection, he had to appear before the members of the Liberal Party in the Manly area, and one of the questions he had from the floor without any warning was whether he was in favour of sunset clauses in legislation. His reply was that he did support daylight saving!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is now a better understanding of what sunset clauses are and this particular clause was inserted in this piece of legislation by the Liberal and National parties. At the time the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2351"> Labor government did not oppose the clause being inserted because we wanted the legislation carried, but we were confident that these extra powers would allow the Health Insurance Commission to ensure that proper investigations into any allegations of fraud or overservicing did take place. Those measures were the result of close consultation with the AMA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government thought that there were difficulties in the previous process of investigation. Before the amendments were introduced by the former health ministers, Senator Richardson and Ms Lawrence, the process was that the Health Insurance Commission would carry out the preliminary investigations. I understand they would be referred to the Australian Federal Police perhaps for search warrants or for other information to be collected. Then, if it got high enough on the AFP's list of priorities, a brief would be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions before, ultimately, action might be taken in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the powers that were given to the Health Insurance Commission that are under threat from the sunset clause, the legislation ensures that the Health Insurance Commission can use search warrants or can use its powers to collect the information that otherwise would have been required by AFP processes. We still believe that these measures are necessary for the Health Insurance Commission to obtain the information it needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand that there is always a bit of controversy when you are talking about giving any government organisation the power to search or to seize documents. We only want them to be used, and we have always argued that they should only be used, where there is a serious risk that evidence may be destroyed. It is understandable that there were concerns about privacy issues and the possible abuse of these powers. That is why we have been reading with interest the Australian National Audit Office's audit of the powers and the way the Health Insurance Commission has used them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The audit's purpose was to ascertain whether the enhanced investigatory powers had improved the commission's ability to investigate and prosecute fraud and other offences under the health legislation and to determine whether the commission had used the powers with integrity in a professional manner and in accordance with the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ANAO concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enhanced powers have improved the commission's ability to conduct investigations and prepare prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without the powers of this kind the ability of the commission to conduct investigations and prepare prosecutions would be impaired.</PARA>
<PARA>And thirdly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission is using the enhanced powers in accordance with the legislation and in a professional manner.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that, first of all, the parliament should be grateful that the ANAO has been able to conduct that audit and provide such a warm endorsement of the Health Insurance Commission in the way that it has used these powers. In some ways, it is perhaps a pat on the back to former health ministers, Senator Richardson and Ms Lawrence, for being prepared to provide these powers to the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to read the other day that the federal president of the AMA, Dr Weedon, was not quite convinced. The 3 June edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Medicine</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2352">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMA federal president Dr David Weedon said that it was too early to form an opinion and that at the very least the sunset period should be extended by another year. `The whole thing should be kept under review, and no decision should be taken for at least another 12 months,' he said.</PARA>
<PARA>Admittedly, he does go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The AMA believes that fraud is fraud and we have no sympathy for anybody who commits fraud.'</PARA>
<PARA>I think that the ANAO audit is sufficient evidence to persuade me, and obviously the government, that we do not need to give the Health Insurance Commission another one-year trial. We think that there is sufficient evidence that the Health Insurance Commission can be trusted with these powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like, at this point, to note that during the election campaign the Liberal&hyphen;National parties in their election policy on health said that they would make the Medicare system work as efficiently as possible and that a coalition government would also direct the Health Insurance Commission to step up its efforts to identify and prosecute overservicing and fraud. Perhaps in the summing up the minister might indicate whether this policy commitment means that the government might be considering introducing further changes to the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Act 1994. Perhaps she and the government might give consideration to undoing some of the amendments to the original bill which, I understand, were moved by the then opposition. Some words, according to the Health Insurance Commission, have emasculated the Health Insurance Commission's capacity to monitor fraud. I would strongly support the government giving some consideration to these issues even if there is no answer today. If they are to meet the commitment that they gave during the election campaign they might have to take more account of the advice that the Health Insurance Commission has given on previous occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of those reasons, it is a pleasure to be in the chamber today, supporting the government's legislation. I wish the minister well with it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have a number of constituencies to represent in a formal and informal sense, you might say, I felt it was important to speak in support of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1996. Prior to the introduction of Medibank during the term of the Whitlam government, the concepts of medical overservicing and fraud were all but unheard of. Whilst the virtues of Australia's universal health insurance scheme have been widely promulgated and are now an entrenched part of Australia's health and political landscape, attempts by successive governments to deal with abuse of the system still remain focused entirely on the supply side of the equation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wildly spectacular and invariably inaccurate claims have been made at different times in the past about the extent of alleged medical overservicing and fraud. The previous government even factored in a figure of $300 million per year in its 1993 budget forward estimates. By the time he retreated from both the health portfolio and the parliament, the former health minister, the then Senator Graham Richardson, was prepared to admit that nobody really knew what figure to place on it but that `it might not be much at all'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his 1992 annual report, the Auditor&hyphen;General called for enhanced legislative powers for the Health Insurance Commission to tackle overservicing and fraud. This bill relates specifically to fraud. Thankfully, it is, as we have just heard from the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), a bipartisan issue. The powers embodied in this legislation allow the Health Insurance Commission to obtain information and conduct searches in order to monitor compliance with Medicare guidelines.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2353">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the latter part of 1993, when I was the President of the Australian Medical Association, we assisted the then minister to develop legislation&mdash;which is something about which I will make a few comments later&mdash;to address inappropriate medical servicing and fraud. The AMA then, as now, supported the transfer to the Health Insurance Commission from the Australian Federal Police of the investigation of alleged fraudulent activity by doctors and patients. Support for such a transfer was based on a frustration shared by both the HIC and the AMA that the Federal Police, having a very broad and difficult range of issues to investigate for prosecution, were often forced to place a low priority on Health Insurance Commission matters, in the context of their arguably more important range of national criminal investigations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the legislation transferred significant and wide ranging powers to the Health Insurance Commission, it was considered prudent by both the medical profession and the then government, on the advice of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, that a sunset clause for a reasonable period of time be inserted, to be used to examine whether the powers had been abused in any way by the Health Insurance Commission. It would seem that, in the two years since it was enacted, neither the Australian National Audit Office nor the AMA has found that the safety mechanisms employed by the HIC, as described in the bill, have been abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the view of the government&mdash;as we have heard from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and from Parliamentary Secretary Woods in the second reading speech in the Senate&mdash;that the mechanisms should now be preserved by repealing section 2 of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment 1994 and item 68 or schedule 1 of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995. Section 2 of the health legislation specifically provided that the entire act should cease to have force on and from 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The powers of investigation which were specifically granted to the HIC in the Health Insurance Amendment Act 1994 are in part IID of the Health Insurance Act 1993. Those powers are summarised as the power to require a person to give information or produce a document; the power to enter and conduct searches of premises without consent of the occupier; the power to search premises, after entry with consent, to take photographs of anything except documents, to inspect and take samples of drugs, substances or ingredients, and to take extracts from any documents but not in relation to clinical details; the power to seize evidential material; the power to apply for a magistrate to issue a search warrant to search premises and seize material; the power to remove things from the premises to determine if they are things that may be seized; the power to seize material not included on the warrant, if reasonably necessary; and the power to return material that is seized.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the significance of these powers, it is important that honourable members appreciate the safeguards that exist on those powers, because they are, as you can see, quite considerable. In order to obtain a warrant, a document called in information must be sworn on oath. The information must set out the grounds for suspecting that there may be particular evidential material at the premises, and the magistrate can refuse to issue the warrant if not satisfied that there are reasonable grounds. The warrant is only valid for seven days and must state the purpose, the time when entry is authorised, a description of the material to be seized and whether this includes records containing clinical details. A warrant may also be obtained by telephone in urgent circumstances.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2354">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The details of the warrant must be given to the occupier. Patients must be informed, unless prejudicial to the investigation, if clinical details are involved. It is an offence punishable by fine or two years imprisonment to make false or misleading statements in an application for a warrant and/or telephone warrant. A section 8P notice is only valid for 14 days and must be issued on reasonable grounds and does not include the power to inspect clinical records, unless it is the patient who is being required to give the information in relation to a claim that has been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The power to issue the 8P notice and the power of entry and seizure by consent or warrant apply to certain offences under the Health Insurance Act 1973, including the making of false or misleading statements in connection with a Medicare claim, knowingly making false statements relating to Medicare benefits, false statements, bribery in relation to the rendering of pathology services, and prohibited practices in relation to pathology services. The penalties for these offences are severe, ranging from fines of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for five years, to both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although there are certain safeguards built into the legislation requiring the exercise of these powers, as I have outlined, a lingering concern exists within the medical profession that there is no mechanism for internal review prior to execution of the powers. A person who receives a section 8P notice is not able to apply to the issuing officer for the review of the decision. One of the proposals that the parliament may wish to consider in due course is the establishment of an office of the Health Insurance Commission Ombudsman, who could oversee the use of these powers so that there is an avenue of appeal. In this regard, amongst numerous others, I will be keeping a watchful eye on the consequences to those under investigation of the issuing of section 8P notices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further concern put to me by the Australian Doctors Fund and its diligent, hardworking chief executive, Mr Stephen Milgate, is the possibility that these powers could be used in relation to `simple billing errors'. Certainly, section 128A&mdash;the making of a false or misleading statement in relation to a claim&mdash;could be used as the `relevant sense' in order to exercise those powers. However, looking at the requirements for a section 8P notice and obtaining authorisation for entry with consent or obtaining a search warrant, I find it difficult to envisage that they, in fact, would be exercised in relation to simple errors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering the repeal of the sunset clause in this legislation, honourable members should be aware that, in its submission to the Australian National Audit Office's review, the Australian Medical Association stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Association is not aware of any complaints from members specifically relating to the HIC's use of investigatory powers granted under the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>To elaborate on that, from speaking to the senior officers of the AMA, I understand that, when the association wrote to all of its branches and subsidiary and kindred medical organisations, there was not one concern expressed by any legitimate or mainstream medical organisation under the umbrella of the AMA about the present powers that the act covers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, the ANAO's report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Impact of sunset clause on investigatory powers: Follow&hyphen;up audit</EMPHASIS>, summarised the functioning of the present legislative provisions as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enhanced powers to investigate fraud and excessive servicing have improved the Commission's ability to conduct investigations and prepare prosecutions. The ANAO considers without powers of this kind, the ability of the Commission to conduct investigations and prepare prosecutions would be impaired. This view has been supported by stakeholders consulted during the audit, and the Commission is using the enhanced powers in accordance with the legislation and in a professional manner. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2355">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One concern that is a reasonable one for the parliament to consider is the level of funding that governments actually make available to the Health Insurance Commission for its genuine and legitimate activities in monitoring and covering surveillance of Medicare benefits. If you consider that the budget available is in the vicinity of $11 million to oversee some $7.6 billion in Medicare benefits and another $2.3 billion in pharmaceutical benefits, I think some consideration could, and perhaps should, be given by government at some stage to increasing, at the very least, the money available for surveillance. That would be in the interests of both patients and the medical profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding, I urge honourable members to refrain from cheap and unwarranted attacks on the integrity of the medical profession, fuelled in some instances by the politics of envy and mediocrity. Alleged medical overservicing is a term that is almost impossible to define, except by a group of the doctor's own peers. The previous government, to its great credit, passed legislation which enables processes of peer review to determine what excessive servicing may or may not be. In fact, I recall at the time we were working with the government on this legislation and trying to bring our membership along with us&mdash;which is not an easy task, I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;that defining overservicing is a bit like pornography: you cannot define it, but you know it when you see it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fraud is quite a different matter&mdash;and the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has just alluded to this in quoting comments from the immediate past president of the AMA. When governments fund medical services and patients accept government funding, the powers of investigation of alleged fraudulent behaviour are necessarily substantial. Apart from repealing the sunset clause in this act, it is long past time that this parliament considered, in a bipartisan way, mechanisms for addressing the unsustainable growth in demand for publicly funded medical services which endangers the present Medicare arrangements far more than the improper behaviour of a very small number of doctors who nonetheless need to be brought to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the benefit of the member for Dobell, I would also remind the House that the Health Insurance Commission indeed did want far more power than was finally given to them in the legislation. They wanted the power to be the policemen; they wanted the power to be the jury and the judge; they wanted to do everything in&hyphen;house. They wanted their own people to determine what unnecessary services were and they wanted power unto themselves to investigate and prosecute for fraud. Correctly, in the opinion of the AMA and also of the previous government, that was quite unacceptable. Whilst I am very happy to support this piece of legislation and the removing of the sunset clause, I would not under any circumstances like to see the HIC have more power than it already has. I would, however, like to see them have more resources to do what they are supposed to be doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is also a very good illustration of what can be achieved when governments put aside what I call the class war; when they start to realise that a lot more can be achieved by working with professional organisations in the medical area than working against them. Sometimes some of the language which has been used by some representatives of the previous government in particular in describing doctors is, I can only say, not helpful to developing this kind of cooperative approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to pay tribute to one of my constituents&mdash;the former health minister, Mr Graham Richardson. In paying tribute to him I know I will not attract his vote, because he is always a very truthful man and he said that he would go to the grave voting Labor. I am sure he will do that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I just want to respond to the question put by the shadow minister. As I am sure the shadow minister will realise, it was really important that we brought this amending legislation before the House at this time and expedited it as quickly as possible so that the work of the Health Insurance Commission can proceed without interruption. I think you will agree that that is the most appropriate course of action at this time. However, I am sure that my colleague the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) will be keeping a close watching brief on the operation of this act and that, if necessary, it will come under parliamentary scrutiny at a later date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted also to say that I heard the shadow minister's comment that he was satisfied with the audit report. It was a very thorough report, as one would expect from an audit report. I think it is heartening to know that there was good and close consultation with the stakeholders in this area and that no stakeholder consulted expressed any concern about the inappropriate use of the enhanced powers by the commission. The AMA was one of those consulted and it responded that the association had not been made aware of any complaints from members specifically relating to the HIC's use of the investigatory powers granted under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can be certain that it has been thoroughly gone into and that we can confidently pass this piece of legislation through the House today and allow the Health Insurance Commission to get on with the task that it has to do in ensuring that it puts a stop to fraud and to Medicare practices that the public has a right to expect will not continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have a duty to the public. The public has a right to expect that we will ensure adequate powers are available to the Health Insurance Commission so that it can carry out all the investigations that need to be carried out and, as I said, put a stop to abuse of practices and to any Medicare fraud that might be taking place. It is of great cost to the community and it is unfair to those providers in the community who are doing the right thing.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill amends the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. It will enhance the international leadership role Australia has established in the fight against the use of prohibited drugs in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2357"> sport. It will allow the Australian Sports Drug Agency to work more cooperatively with international sports organisations to conduct drug tests, both at major sporting events and out of competition, on an annual basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also ensure that this country's successful anti-doping program operates even more efficiently and effectively. Drug testing programs will continue to deter athletes from using drugs while at the same time ensuring the rights of athletes who undergo drug testing will not be compromised. Most importantly, this bill will reduce the likelihood of legal challenges which may result from an athlete returning a positive drug test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Sports Drug Agency, by way of background, was established in response to the recommendations of the then Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I acknowledge the considerable efforts of several of my colleagues on that committee in successfully advocating the need for such an agency, which has always had strong bipartisan support. The coalition sport and recreation policy, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encouraging players&mdash;developing champions</EMPHASIS>, demonstrates the continuing support of this side of the parliament to the eradication of drugs in sport and the work of the agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that since the establishment of the Australian Sports Drug Agency this country has positioned itself as a leader in the international fight against doping, a fact recognised throughout the world. Since its establishment, the Australian Sports Drug Agency has conducted more than 15,000 drug tests and has implemented comprehensive education programs throughout schools and sports in this country. It has also developed guidelines for drug education for use by the international sports community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These programs have been remarkably successful. During the past year, for example, more than 3,000 drug tests have been undertaken by ASDA and more than 99 per cent of tests were `drug free'. The Australian Sports Drug Agency has also been successful in working with professional sports leagues to conduct testing programs on a fee for service basis. All these drug tests are analysed by the internationally accredited Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory in Sydney. This laboratory will analyse about 2,000 drug tests during the two to three weeks of the Sydney Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years the Australian Sports Drug Agency has played an increasingly successful role in working internationally so that our athletes can compete on a more level playing field. Drug testing programs have been implemented cooperatively in the international sports of athletics, cycling, rowing, weight&hyphen;lifting, swimming and gymnastics. During the past 12 months the number of out-of-competition drug tests conducted by international sports has increased by almost 50 per cent. In its relatively brief history the Australian Sports Drug Agency has carried out the drug testing programs for the world swimming championships, the South&hyphen;East Asian Games, the world weight&hyphen;lifting championships and a host of other major international sporting events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also entered into anti-doping agreements with other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, France, New Zealand and Norway. This multilateral agreement will lead to the establishment of an international benchmark for testing programs utilising an internationally recognised system of accreditation and certification. Australia was also the first non-European country to accede to the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, which aims to harmonise anti-doping programs between countries. Most significantly, following a request from the Chinese anti-doping authorities, the Australian Sports Drug Agency is assisting China to establish its own sports drug agency.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2358">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These substantial international achievements are only possible because of our strong and successful national anti-doping programs. The Australian Sports Drug Agency, in concert with the Australian Sports Commission and all state and territory departments responsible for sport and recreation, has coordinated the development of a national drugs in sport framework. The framework was endorsed by all Commonwealth, state and territory ministers for sport in November 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was common recognition across all states and territories that achieving the objectives of this anti-doping initiative will lead to the following matters: athletes around Australia being exposed to consistent drug testing programs; opportunities for all elite athletes to receive sport drug education; an emphasis on promoting the ethos that the use of drugs to enhance sports performance is cheating; and improvements in the expertise of government and sport to develop effective drugs in sport policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government fully endorses those objectives and commits itself to strengthening Australia's strong anti-doping programs through the coordinated action of all governments in the drugs in sport area. The framework recognises the principle of natural justice and the need to respect the rights of individuals. Effective anti-doping programs which deter athletes and their associates from cheating need to recognise that everyone must be treated in a fair and just way. In particular, the framework recognises the rights of young athletes. The development of this framework involved all key players in the sport industry in both the government and non-government sector. It was pleasing to see the Confederation of Australian Sport, which represents more than 100 national sporting organisations, acknowledge the success of this important anti-doping initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This national initiative will be critical in achieving this government's goal of a drug free Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Australia's strong and committed anti-doping stance was considered a significant factor in winning the right to host the 2000 Olympic Games. However, the Australian sports community remains concerned about the lack of an international level playing field in respect to doping. The success of Sydney in winning the right to host the 2000 Games provides us with a unique opportunity to further the international fight against doping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of its leadership status and with the spotlight on Sydney 2000, the government is well placed to demonstrate the effectiveness of its domestic anti-doping programs and in so doing advocate to the international sports community the need for a similar stringent and effective effort. This will not only be critical to the sporting and financial success of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games but will reduce the harm to Australian athletes by ensuring that they are able to compete on equal terms. It also has the potential to re-establish the credibility of international sport and provide a launching pad for a drug-free sporting ethos into the 21st century. The bill will help achieve this goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government supports a comprehensive package of measures aimed at pursuing a drug free 2000 Olympic Games. These measures include:</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a drug testing program that targets international athletes competing and training in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> advocating out&hyphen;of&hyphen;competition testing programs by international sports federations which target their top athletes on an annual basis;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> drug testing programs by SOCOG at the 2000 Olympics and the test events leading up to the 2000 Games;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2359">
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the maintenance of an internationally accredited drug testing laboratory in Australia and continuing research to ensure new doping practices can be detected;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> education programs throughout school and sporting communities;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> anti-doping agreements between Australia and other governments; and</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> measures to reduce both the prescribing and illicit supply of performance enhancing drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package of measures will be implemented by key organisations from the sport, health, education and law enforcement agencies in the government and non-government sectors. The Australian Olympic Committee and the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games&mdash;SOCOG&mdash;will play a critical role. It is encouraging to see SOCOG has already established its drug testing expert committee with a very strong ASDA involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A drug free Sydney 2000 will require cooperation from international sport. The government is committed to working with the International Olympic Committee, the Australian Olympic Committee, and the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games to achieve this important goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill and our anti-doping policies are about sportsmen and sportswomen and their right to compete in drug free sport. For this reason, the Australian Sports Drug Agency has made a great effort to understand the concerns of our athletes and to ask them if they think Australia's anti-doping initiatives are achieving success. The Agency's 1995 survey of elite Australian athletes showed that:</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the majority of athletes think it is likely that they will be tested out-of-competition within the next 12 months. Compared to results from previous years these figures show an increased awareness by athletes of their likelihood of being tested;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> there remains a high degree of accord with all aspects of the ASDA testing program, particularly with the sample collection process and the conduct of ASDA personnel;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia's elite athletes are making use of the information services provided by ASDA. Over 80 per cent of these athletes were satisfied with this service which reflects the growing awareness of athletes about drugs in sport issues;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> thirty-two percent of all athletes are aware of international out&hyphen;of-competition testing in their sport. This is almost double the percentage reported in 1994. Despite this, athletes still express concern over the effectiveness of testing programs outside Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> athletes recognise the need for effective sanctions and believe this is critical if athletes are to be deterred from the use of performance enhancing drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The findings from the survey indicate that, while Australia's approach to the drugs in sport issue has been successful, the international drugs in sport situation is still of concern to athletes. In the core areas of drug testing, education and policy work, the indicators that have been collected for four years all confirm the positive impact that has been made and sustained by ASDA in the sporting environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly ASDA is making progress towards its mission to ensure that Australian athletes are able to compete in sport which is free from banned doping practices. In pursuit of this goal ASDA will continue to focus on the international drugs in sport situation in the lead&hyphen;up to the Sydney Olympics and beyond. These views are supported by the results of the 1993 Mugford Report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Value of Sport, Ethics and the Control of Performance Enhancing Drugs: A Study in the Australian Sports Community</EMPHASIS>. It noted that:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2360">
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> athletes perceive the use of drugs for performance enhancement primarily as cheating;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> ASDA is succeeding in creating a climate where athletes are committed to the rules rather than simply obeying them because of the fear of detection, that is, conformity rather than compliance;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> this climate makes use of performance enhancing drugs much harder for athletes to justify; and</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> sports people identified sport as having a definite value to society, and clearly drug testing and educational programs undertaken by ASDA protect that value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Australia's anti-doping policy is successful we must not become complacent. The amendments in this bill will ensure that our anti-doping programs can operate at an optimum level. The major features of the amendment bill clearly define the objectives of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. These are:</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to deter the use of scheduled drugs or doping methods in sport;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to encourage the development of programs to educate the sporting community about matters relating to drugs in sport;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to advocate the international adoption of consistent and effective anti-doping programs; and</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to coordinate the development of a consistent and effective national response to matters relating to drugs in sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The functions of the agency as outlined in the bill include:</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> development and implementation of drug testing programs;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> advocating the international development and implementation of consistent and effective anti-doping programs; and</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to encourage Australian national sporting organisations, state and territory sporting organisations and professional sporting organisations:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">to develop and implement comprehensive and consistent anti&hyphen;doping initiatives (including initiatives relating to testing for the use of drugs and education about matters relating to drugs in sport); and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">to use the services of the agency and accredited laboratories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agency will also:</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> develop and implement initiatives that increase the skills and knowledge of people involved in sporting activities about matters relating to drugs in sport;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> advocate and support research inside and outside Australia about drugs in sport;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> implement anti-doping arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> encourage the establishment of means for the carrying out by departments and authorities of the states and territories, of initiatives relating to drugs in sport; and</PARA>
<PARA>*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> co-operate with those Departments and authorities and with non&hyphen;government sporting organisations to implement those initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been framed following widespread consultation throughout the sporting and legal communities and other interested parties. This includes the Australian Olympic Committee, the Confederation of Australian Sport, national sporting organisations, the Australia and New Zealand Sports Law Association, and the Privacy Commission.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2361">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation reflects the privacy and human rights principles laid down in other Commonwealth legislation. In particular only those who need to have access to information will be informed. The government has also been concerned to protect the rights of athletes and has built into the legislation certain appeal rights to ensure athletes are protected.</PARA>
<PARA>FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The administrative and operational expenses related to staff and program costs will be determined annually in the budget. The appropriation to the Australian Sports Drug Agency for 1995&hyphen;96 is $3.528 million. This includes an allocation to undertake 2400 `public interest' drug tests on Australian athletes and international athletes who train or compete in this country. It is anticipated that the Australian Sports Drug Agency will generate additional income approaching $500,000 each year from `user pays' education and testing services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is clear evidence of this government's commitment to drug free sport. This bill sends a clear message to the sports community in this country and throughout the world that Australia intends to `beat the cheats'. It also sends an important message to our drug free athletes that this government intends to do everything possible to ensure that Australian sportsmen and sportswomen are able to compete in sport which is free from banned doping practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue which has a record of bipartisan support in this parliament, and I am confident that such support will continue with the prompt passage of this important piece of legislation. I am sure that all members want to ensure that our sporting tradition for fair play remains an integral part of our sporting success and that our children can inherit sport free from the use of drugs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Department does not store data by Federal electoral divisions, local government areas or major towns. Geographical information about labour market program activity is based around the Department's Areas and Regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) The electoral division of Newcastle is covered by the Mayfield and Newcastle Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) offices and the Hamilton Regional Office. As at 8 May 1996 these offices had spent $21.9m on labour market programs. It should be noted that while these offices are within the electoral division of Newcastle, they cover a geographical area wider than the electorate and therefore not all of their expenditure would have been for people living within the electorate or activities within the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Hunter region is covered by the Hamilton, Upper Hunter and Lake Macquarie CES regions. In addition payments are made directly from Hunter Northern Area office to New Work Opportunities, JobSkills and Landcare and Environment Action Program (LEAP) providers in the Hunter region. As at 8 May 1996, $45.9m had been spent on labour market programs in the Hunter region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Higher education funding is allocated on a calendar year basis. As a result, figures have been provided for calendar years rather than financial years and are in Estimated Average 1996 prices. In 1995, the University received $140,999,480. Funds totalling $139,406,274 have been allocated to the University for 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an apparent drop in funds between 1995 and 1996. This is due to the University receiving <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2364"> $4.6 million from the Capital Development Pool in 1995, but no allocations from this source in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Department does not yet have access to final enrolment data for 1996. Figures will not be available until later this year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Department does not have data about the amount of recurrent funding provided to individual TAFE colleges. Commonwealth recurrent funding is provided by the Australian National Training Authority to the State and Territory Training Authorities, who distribute it to TAFE Colleges.</PARA>
