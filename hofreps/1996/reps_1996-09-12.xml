<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the question of the budget, can I say that, while it might take <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4116"> some time for people to realise it, this budget marks the end of an era&mdash;and a very important era. It marks the end of an era in which Australian governments have tried to achieve full employment for their citizens: the concept of all Australians being entitled to a job and to a real job opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clearest indicator of this is the decision in the budget to abolish the Commonwealth Employment Service. The CES was set up in 1946, exactly half a century ago. It was an integral part of the postwar consensus shaped by the Labor Party and which has survived up until now to strive for full employment. So important was the idea of a Commonwealth Employment Service, of a free employment exchange, in the project of postwar reconstruction that it was enshrined in an international convention. In 1949, member nations of the ILO, following the declaration of Philadelphia that established the ILO and set up in bright lights the question of full employment as an objective for all nations, resolved to phase out fee&hyphen;charging employment agencies. They did this so that all nations would maintain or ensure the maintenance of a free employment service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was to be an employment service available to all workers. The concept of one nation was for all Australians to have access to a free employment service irrespective of where you lived&mdash;be it metropolitan Australia or country and regional Australia. It is interesting to note that, following the establishment of the Commonwealth Employment Service in 1946, a network of Commonwealth Employment Service offices all around Australia was established as a result of that decision, the decision of this parliament. It was important because this was to be an employment service available to all workers&mdash;not just those who could pass a mean&hyphen;spirited government's `capacity to benefit' test, as is the Howard government's approach of today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other components of that great postwar consensus included the 1944 White Paper on Full Employment and a bold program of public works such as the Snowy Mountains scheme&mdash;a scheme which I think we all believe was of the utmost importance to the future of Australia. That scheme also, as part <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of postwar reconstruction, gave the opportunity to many people to come to Australia from a range of countries around the world and to contribute to the development of this great nation. These creations came about because of the vision of people like Ben Chifley, the then Labor Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that the then opposition supported the establishment of the Commonwealth Employment Service. The reason the then Labor government brought these schemes in and supported not only decent national infrastructure projects but also the Commonwealth Employment Service was that people who had experienced the scourge of mass unemployment in the Depression of the 1930s decided that they had an obligation to ensure that it would never be repeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who benefited were people like my own father, who was given the opportunity for trade training and work as a bricklayer by the policies of putting jobs first pursued by the postwar Labor government. It is interesting to note that those very people were offered a six-month training course not dissimilar to those opportunities provided under Working Nation. The objective was to ensure that, having been given access to some basic training and to the opportunity of getting some basic skills, they were then given the very experience in industry which would ensure that they were not only job ready but also capable of accessing ongoing, meaningful employment. A generation of Australians was appreciative of the programs pursued by the likes of Ben Chifley, just as I say that a generation of Australians would have benefited by the current government pursuing the type of Working Nation initiatives put in place by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> All governments, Labor and Liberal, to varying degrees have stuck to the goal of full employment since that time. Social changes and changes in the world economy, particularly since 1973, have naturally made that goal much harder to attain than in the long years of postwar post economic boom. The goal itself, I am pleased to say, has always been upheld until now. But not now&mdash;no, not any more&mdash;not after the first Howard budget.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4117">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget marks the first time since the Second World War that a new government has failed to even try to reduce unemployment in its first budget. That is what it has failed to do: it has failed to even suggest that its primary objective at the moment&mdash;in its first budget, in its first term of government&mdash;is to reduce unemployment. This budget is the first time since the Great Depression of the 1930s that an Australian government has wilfully ignored the curse of unemployment and, more importantly, deliberately withdrawn services from those disadvantaged people in many areas of Australia, especially in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has effectively, through the budget, thrown the towel in and stated publicly that unemployment is now no longer a priority. What a disgrace to think that in 1996 the number one challenge confronting Australia&mdash;the question of reducing unemployment&mdash;is not a priority in the Howard government's agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many challenges confronting Australia. If you go out into mainstream Australia, into the suburbs and the regions of Australia, all they want to talk about at the moment is the ongoing responsibility of both sides of the Australian parliament to put their heads together and do something about the question of unemployment because those people do not want to see a generation lost without opportunity and without a capacity to pursue a meaningful opportunity in life. That is why I say that, without a doubt, the Howard government&mdash;and, yes, they ought to hang their heads in shame&mdash;have thrown the towel in and stated publicly that unemployment is not a priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Employment Service is staffed&mdash;and I am pleased to say this&mdash;by thousands of dedicated men and women around Australia. Unlike some on the other side of the House would suggest, those men and women who staff the CES take on the difficult task day in and day out of matching job seekers with available job vacancies. To their credit they help steer the long-term unemployed into suitable case management, training and support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 1.8 million Australians who use the Commonwealth Employment Service each year. I tell you why they use it&mdash;because they know that the staff of the Commonwealth Employment Service are dedicated men and women in the suburbs of metropolitan Australia, in the suburbs of regional centres of Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="DONDAS" NAMEID="5M6">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LS4">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even in the Northern Territory, for the information of the member for the Northern Territory. Those men and women are totally consumed with their desire to assist in matching job seekers with available job vacancies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently had an opportunity to speak to some of those dedicated people at Casuarina CES in the Northern Territory. I can tell this House that they are totally concerned with the need to maintain that local CES office, to maintain the opportunity to ensure that they have ongoing resources and support from government to do something about matching job seekers with available job vacancies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real problem is that they question whether or not the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) was prepared to stand up and fight for a network of CES offices throughout the Northern Territory rather than throw the towel in, just as he threw it in with respect to the Office of Northern Development when this government said that it was no longer a priority for the Howard government to assist with regional development in Australia. Just as he was not prepared to stand up for the Office of Northern Development, he is not prepared to stand up for a network of CES offices throughout the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The local CES is part of our community around Australia. It is a vital part of our sadly fraying community infrastructure. It is an integral part of the balanced set of approaches we started under Working Nation to improve service delivery. If it goes, it will be sorely missed by thousands upon thousands of Australians. It will weaken the very delivery of the active labour market program support that we introduced in government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4118">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">High fees, I suggest, will be charged by the new competing employment placing enterprises&mdash;the so-called EPEs&mdash;in most cases, enabling significant profits to be made by those favoured in the process. The quality of the new job finding services will be diminished&mdash;yes, diminished&mdash;because of the cuts in resources for their regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The long-term unemployed and people living in remote areas, such as in Cairns, Townsville or Rockhampton, and in regions of high unemployment will particularly feel the cut in services as the profit&hyphen;driven EPEs will not be interested in helping the long-term unemployed&mdash;the most difficult cases&mdash;because it is all too hard and the profit margin is not large enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is walking away from the unemployed, just like Margaret Thatcher did in Great Britain. No-one should be fooled by the idea that their CES is going to be adequately replaced by the so-called one-stop shop&mdash;the as yet unnamed service delivery agency. It will be a one-stop shop for the long-term unemployed&mdash;no services, no opportunity in life and condemned to benefits for the rest of their lives, be it in seats such as Lowe, the Northern Territory, Capricornia or Leichhardt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it clear. There is nothing wrong in principle with combining the resources of the current social security offices with the resources of the CES offices. This is a direction in which the previous Labor government was moving. Its objective was to make it simpler for unemployed people to obtain both jobsearch assistance and benefit payments at one location. But that is not what is going to happen now. Mark my words, what is going to happen now is entirely different from what was a fair and practical objective with respect to the establishment of a one-stop shop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going to happen under the Howard government's budget initiatives is that the Commonwealth Employment Service is going to be abolished. Its essential services are going to be sold off to the private sector providers for profit. We are going back to the era of fee-charging employment agencies&mdash;the very thing we sought to outlaw in 1946 when <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we established right throughout Australia a network of CES offices on the basis that it is one nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are plans afoot to have a massive 5,000 fewer staff in the new network of offices than in the old. Yes, another 5,000 jobs going and you can imagine the impact that is going to have on regional Australia in places such as Launceston, where we have already seen the closure of the local CES office; Newcastle, where we have already seen the closure of the Belmont office; Cairns, where we have already seen the closure of the Mareeba CES office since the election; Mowbray; North Melbourne; South Melbourne; and Granville in western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are places that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) might be naturally concerned with in respect of unemployment; places where those citizens of Australia depend on the CES office, respect it and support the dedicated staff who go out of their way to assist them. I suggest that the Prime Minister go and ask the people in these suburbs and towns what they think about losing their CES and its associated jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of the CES represents a huge reduction in service for job seekers. The one-stop shop is just a public relations gloss to divert attention from this violent crime, this violent change which is to be inflicted on the jobless. There is no advantage in having a one-stop shop if there are only half as many shops and if the queues there are twice as long. There is even less advantage if the office's doors are permanently closed to many thousands of job seekers whom the government cannot even be bothered to help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cuts in employment assistance are taking place at John Howard's personal insistence&mdash;mark it: at John Howard's personal insistence. I wonder whether John Howard has any idea of how badly the morale and commitment of CES offices has been hit by his decision to destroy their service. When people see and feel the difference in their lives that the absence of a CES makes, we are going to remind them endlessly of who took it away&mdash;the Howard coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People always want unemployment to improve when they change their government. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4119"> Even the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) understands that. Last night on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> Minister Vanstone stated not once but twice that, if the government did not reduce unemployment, it would not be re&hyphen;elected. By this action she has set the jobs target that John Howard has been running away from as the Prime Minister.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LS4">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By this action she has set the jobs target that the Prime Minister has been running away from time and time again. I can understand why the coalition is so sensitive about this concept. If a party promises to do something about unemployment, the electorate expects it to do something about unemployment. It is not going to be conned by the failure of the Prime Minister and the government to face up to their responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this government have suddenly stopped talking about reducing unemployment. They have stopped talking about it as part of a political strategy. They think that they can portray the unemployed as being on the edges of society, away from the mainstream of Australia. Yes, push them over the cliff and pretend that they do not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the problem is that they do exist. They exist in the suburbs of metropolitan Australia and they exist in regional Australia. They are not going to go away because unemployment today is an issue which concerns all Australians. Whether you have a job or not, you regard unemployment as the number one issue that we as a nation have to continue to make progress on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment is an issue which concerns all of us, not just those who are currently out of work but also those who fear being out of work, such as the 30,000 public servants who will lose their jobs in the first 18 months of the new government&mdash;in fact, all those people who have a sense of insecurity about their lives and the lives of their families at the moment. That will not instil a sense of confidence in the economy and ensure that it achieves adequate growth rates to achieve the five per cent jobs target that we established in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the previous government&mdash;a target that would have been achieved as the economic and social strategy that we had put in place was maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian community knows that it is wrong to chop over 200,000 places from labour market programs this year because that will sell their futures and their kids' futures short. It will sell the community short and create a series of little ghettos all around Australia. That in turn will impact on mainstream Australia&mdash;the mainstream Australia that the Prime Minister likes to wrap himself around. The Prime Minister cannot accept that we as a nation will not tolerate a series of little ghettos all around Australia, and the situation will be worse by a reduction over the next four years of labour market expenditure of $1.8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that unemployment is something that the Prime Minister claimed to be concerned about during the election. He has now walked away from his responsibilities. The Australian community knows that, above all, we need a new set of policies to create more jobs&mdash;policies which expand our nation's growth, not contract it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surveys of employment vacancies since this government was elected show that vacancies have already slumped to their lowest level in years. The burst of confidence normally associated with a new government is glaringly absent. Little wonder, given that in the six months since this government took office it has moved to axe some 30,000 jobs in the public sector, up to another 30,000 in Telstra and countless more in higher education. Now, with this no jobs budget&mdash;that is what it is&mdash;another $8 billion is to be taken out of the economy over the next two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will that do for economic confidence and the capacity of the economy to grow? According to the outlays in the budget papers, for the employment creation activities and labour market programs, a massive $1.8 billion was taken out. But only $160 million was put into the modern Australian apprenticeship and training scheme for the young unemployed. And they say that MAATS is the panacea for resolving unemployment in Australia! </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4120">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the member for the Northern Territory is listening because I know that local communities in towns in the Northern Territory very much supported the Working Nation initiatives and the putting in place of infrastructure developments that the Northern Territory government denied them. What is their expense from MAATS over four years? It is only another $160 million, a pretty miserable amount. The token amount of money put in by the new government will have no effect in reducing youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support Labor's amendments to the second reading motion. Labor will never give up striving for full employment as this government has given up. We will revive this great ideal. We will devise the means to attain it just as the Australian people expect their governments to do. The issue of the day is unemployment. I contend that it is about time that the new government lived up to its responsibilities. It should set a jobs target because anyone who wants to achieve anything in life should be prepared to set targets. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join this debate on the Appropriation Bill, but before I go into the main part of what I wish to say, I would like to make passing reference to some matters raised by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). He did raise some interesting points. In his almost 20&hyphen;minute address, he spent nearly all of his time <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4121"> talking about two specific matters: unemployment and the CES. He said that the Howard government is sensitive about the issue of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the Howard coalition government is very sensitive about the issue of unemployment. One of the reasons we were elected with such an overwhelming majority is that people were telling us that they were feeling sensitive about the issue of unemployment. It is an indictment on Labor&mdash;a party that purports to stand for working class Australia&mdash;that, after 13 years in government, there are one million Australians who are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Batman mentioned the scourge of mass unemployment, and that is absolutely right. After 13 years, we do have a scourge of unemployment. He said that everywhere he goes in Australia, he is told by average Australians that the government and the opposition should put their heads together to reduce unemployment. I think that is absolutely right. The people I speak to are saying to me, `Why doesn't the Labor Party join the government in attacking the question of unemployment, in doing something specific and something concrete about unemployment?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The feigned concern that the Labor Party have for the unemployed was brought home to me when, at the request of former New South Wales Premier Greiner, I represented New South Wales at a meeting of state treasurers here in Canberra. The then Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, was sitting only a couple of seats away from me in the cabinet room. He asked the Treasury officials, `What is the situation regarding the LTUs?' I had never heard of such a phrase. I felt a bit uneasy because I thought that if I were to ask the New South Wales Treasury officials what LTUs were, they might tell me that I should know what they were. I did not know, so I thought I had better find out. I turned to the Treasury officials and asked, `What are the LTUs that the Prime Minister is referring to?' They replied, `Long-term unemployed.' For a Labor Prime Minister of Australia to refer to the one million Australians&mdash;half a million of whom are long-term unemployed&mdash;by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> using the acronym LTU is indicative that those opposite have lost their commitment to the people who are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that was raised by the member for Batman was the question of the CES. He kept saying repeatedly that the new government is going to abolish the CES. I put it to the honourable member for Batman that there is a very big difference between abolishing and re-organising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CES is well intentioned, but it has not delivered. With one million Australians out of work and with no hope for a reduction in long-term unemployment, the CES has to adopt a different attitude and a different way of doing things. As I have said, there is no doubt that the staff of the CES are committed. They all work hard and no-one should decry their involvement and their commitment. However, it has not been working and something must be done. There is no doubt that the CES will find that, once they get re-organised and they merge with the Department of Social Security in a one-stop shop, costs will come down and a better service will be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the budget. If there is anything that defined the attitude of the previous Keating Labor government to budgets it is deficit and debt. When we came into government we found that the underlying deficit for 1995 was $10.3 billion. We face a starting point deficit for 1996-97 of $9.6 billion. The emphasis in this budget is on reducing the deficit. In my opinion, the best outcome is a return of confidence in the economy. There will be a $3.9 billion reduction in the deficit this year and a further $3.3 billion reduction in the deficit next year&mdash;that is, a reduction in the deficit of $7.2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was scandalous with regard to the attitude of the former government was its own purpose spending. During the  past five years, own purpose spending for the federal Labor government grew by an astounding 45 per cent. I have rarely seen growth to that extent and the former Labor government should be ashamed of itself for allowing its own purpose spending to grow by 45 per cent in a three&hyphen;year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all the tough but fair and responsible financial measures taken by the Howard <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4122"> government to reduce spending, we still face a deficit of $5.6 billion in 1996-97 and a deficit of $1.5 billion the year after. If the Keating government had been re-elected, there is no doubt that Australia's credit rating would have been further eroded with all the consequential results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to note that in the mid&hyphen;1980s Australia enjoyed a AAA credit rating. In the mid&hyphen;1980s, after only a few years of Labor government, Moody's decided to downgrade Australia's credit rating from AAA to AA1 and at the same time Standard and Poor's downgraded Australia's credit rating to AA plus. In 1989, for the second time, Standard and Poor's downgraded Australia's credit rating from AA plus down to AA. In 1989, Moody's reduced Australia's credit rating from AA1 to AA2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means a great deal on the international economic front. There is no doubt that a risk premium is added to Australia's borrowings with any downgrading of our credit rating. The result of the addition of a risk premium means that Australians have to pay more to borrow money. That is an impost on Australia and Australians&mdash;an impost that has to be paid. As a result, the cost of living goes up, the cost of borrowing goes up and the cost of running businesses goes up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to note that, as a result of this budget, Standard and Poor's has announced only very recently that Australia could, after 13 years, have its credit rating upgraded. That is a very positive thing for Australia and all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the question of promises kept. First of all, I want to refer to self&hyphen;funded retirees. The tax rebate for all self&hyphen;funded retirees, costing up to $80 million, has been instituted. Child&hyphen;care cash rebates costing in the vicinity of $120 million per year have been retained more or less in general terms. The subsidy for private health insurance has been delivered at $450.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a tough but fair budget which shares the burden. That is another way to describe it&mdash;tough but fair. There is to be a higher Medicare levy for high income earners&mdash;something the former government did not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have the courage to tackle. The seniors card, costing about $160 million, has been retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter I believe is very important and needs to be addressed in this parliament is that of rich tax avoiders. It is very interesting that the former Labor government waited until three weeks, or maybe even two weeks, before the election to say that, if they are returned, they will address the issue of rich tax avoiders. Why did they wait for 13 years to say something about this rort, which is costing the average Australian a lot of money? This situation is unnecessary and should have been tackled. I was very glad to see that rich tax avoiders will have to pay a fair amount of money to consolidated revenue. It is expected that some $100 million will be collected. Labor failed to act, and the Howard government has now addressed this very important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the Beazley black hole, the $8 billion, the August 1995 budget papers showed Treasury's forward estimates of government spending and revenue. They indicated to us that that would be in the vicinity of $2 billion or $3 billion. In February 1996, just prior to the election, Treasury made available to the government the estimates, which were secreted away by a drowning Keating Labor government and not shown to the coalition until after the election win. They showed the forward estimates for 1995&mdash;that is, for the 1996-97 year, with outlays at $135 billion and income at $134 billion. This was the situation prior to the information being made available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Upon coming to government, we found an increase in outlays of $2 billion, bringing that up to $137 billion&mdash;this information was not passed on to the Howard&hyphen;Fischer coalition&mdash;and that income was reduced by $4 billion. So there was $137 billion in outlays and $129 billion in income. We should have known about all this prior to the election. In all honesty the former government should have made that information available, but they chose not to and are now screaming when we talk about the Beazley black hole. No wonder they are screaming. They are saying we should have known. How could we have known when they had that information and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4123"> kept it from the opposition? This will not happen again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Costello budget is deflationary. Last year&mdash;that is, 1995-96&mdash;spending grew at 3.9 per cent, which is reasonable. This year there will be a zero growth rate as a result of the Keating government's policies. Following the forward estimates coming into effect, the growth rate this year is zero, and that is an indictment of the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget has an emphasis on small business. The labour market programs, which the honourable member for Batman referred to at great length, have cost the Australian taxpayer billions of dollars and have failed miserably. The former government threw money at all these problems with no long-term planning and put people into a job for a while and then threw them out of it when the money ran out. Look at all the programs the former government put in place: One Nation, Investing in the Nation, Working Nation, Creative Nation&mdash;and so the list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian public, the Australian electorate, were very patient with the former government. They gave the former government a good go and they just did not deliver. The most effective way any government can genuinely assist the unemployed is by getting the economy right. Governments borrowing money to provide short-term jobs are only putting the inevitable off as they will ultimately have to face up to the fact that borrowings have to be repaid and the losers are again the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed. A healthy small business sector is the quickest and only way to take up employment. This budget, within present constraints, goes a long way towards achieving that goal&mdash;for example, by providing relief in relation to capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to jobs growth, because the honourable member for Batman spent all of his 20&hyphen;minute contribution on jobs and I think it is vitally important we set the record straight. At the beginning of the year, jobs growth was about three per cent. We need five per cent jobs growth to bring unemployment down to a reasonable level&mdash;if any unemployment is reasonable. More recently, because of the former government's policies, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> jobs growth has dwindled to about one per cent. So how can the honourable member for Batman or the opposition say that they should not have been kicked out of government when the growth rate has been reduced to the vicinity of one per cent? Very large numbers of Australians will have no future unless jobs growth is increased substantially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know some commentators have said that a reduction in spending and the tightening of fiscal measures will mean an even slower jobs growth. However, that assertion has to be seen in the context of the $4 billion reduction in spending in 1996-97 compared with Australia's GDP, which is in the vicinity of $460 billion. That is a one per cent reduction. As I mentioned previously, the renewed confidence in small and medium business will bring about the uplift of the economy. This budget provides the necessary framework and, in conjunction with industrial relations changes&mdash;especially the changes to the unfair dismissal laws to make them fair dismissal laws by protecting the rights of employers and the employees&mdash;will go a long way towards that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say a lot more about industrial relations changes because they are needed to increase the work force substantially and are one of the cornerstones of this budget. However, time is running out&mdash;I have only three or four minutes left&mdash;so in my concluding remarks I want to refer to the very important issue of fiscal transparency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, one of the most underrated achievements in the presentation of these budget papers is on the table demonstration; that is, the above&hyphen;the&hyphen;board demonstration to the electorate of the true operating situation. In other words, there are to be no more mirrors and smokescreens. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) must be commended for showing leadership, the likes of which has not been demonstrated by other Treasurers in the last decade or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of words such as `headline balance', which is technical jargon used to describe the budget balance and is virtually useless in trying to determine the exact position, is now going to be a thing of the past. These headline balances in the past used <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4124"> asset sales and other such items as income to cloud the issue. Whilst it is technically correct to say that an asset sale is income and therefore should be included as part of the budget process and shown as a plus, we all know that the sale of an asset is a once only item. Therefore it is irresponsible to show it as income for the purpose of balancing the budget, because you cannot keep selling an asset that has already been sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget and future budgets will show the underlying budget position, which is the only fair and just process to follow, so that the electorate obtains an accurate position of what the government is doing with the moneys that, after all, belong to the people. The measures taken in this budget will do what the former Labor government has failed to do, and that is, encourage domestic savings which will result in more domestic investment in the public spheres. The huge external debt will fall exponentially, aided by the $6 billion the government will apply to reduce that debt as a result of the partial sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that these long overdue measures will result in the short-term stabilisation of interest rates and in fact could well mean a modest reduction in the rates early next year. Unless grave and unforeseen circumstances occur, what is absolutely certain is that in the long run interest rates will fall and that will mean that business will begin to again invest in stock and capital equipment, resulting in a lift in productivity and a reduction in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that the Treasurer has set the benchmark in this budget for future budgets and he must be commended, as I said earlier. Perhaps the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 21 August 1996 put it best when it said about the Treasurer and the budget `A job well done'.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.25 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This budget is a mean and nasty budget. It is a budget in the true John Howard tradition from his days as Treasurer. It is a budget which is contractionary. It is a budget which will reduce the degree of growth that has been left by the former government. It is a budget for high unemployment. It is a budget which attacks the living standards of low income <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> earners and the battlers that this government so hypocritically purports to represent. Particularly, it is a budget that fails to address the nation's transport problems. I will devote the early part of my remarks to the areas that specifically relate to my shadow ministry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first and most significant area with respect to the budget in the transport area is the issue of roads. It is an issue that the National Party in particular has long tried to make its own. It is an issue that Labor governments have often been criticised for in relation to the amounts they have devoted to road development in public expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lo and behold: what have we seen after the promises that have been made by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, and the coalition to maintain Labor's commitments to national highway funding, to maintain Labor's commitments to payments to the states and local government with respect to roads and, in addition, to spend $65 million per year over 10 years on the Pacific Highway and $36 million a year over four years on the black spots program? What have we seen delivered?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the specific promises with respect to the Pacific Highway and black spots; yes, they have been delivered. Funding to local government and the states is virtually identical over the four&hyphen;year period of the forward estimates to that which was proposed by Labor. But where the big cut occurs and where the big damage occurs is in the national highway program. Six hundred and twenty-two million dollars over four years is to be taken out of the national highway program. Even if you ignore the promise to make the new commitments to the Pacific Highway and black spots additional to existing commitments and factor in the amounts there, you still end up with funding that is more than $50 million per year over the four years&mdash;over $200 million over the four years&mdash;less than what the former Labor government was going to commit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4125"> Of course, the minister has tried to fudge this by saying, `We're actually spending a little bit more than was spent last year.' But that is not what was promised. What was promised was maintenance of existing com mitments and additional funding for specific programs. That promise has been explicitly broken, and broken to the tune of $620-odd million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in Townsville are now asking, `What is happening to the Woolcock Street extension?' People in western Sydney are wondering what is going to happen to the western orbital, so vital for infrastructure development and employment in western Sydney. In many other parts of Australia, areas that depend on national highway funding are now asking, `What is John Sharp doing for us?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area that is suffering, and is going to suffer further as a result of the release yesterday of the Brew report with respect to the Australian National Railways Commission, is rail funding. The former government was committed to $370 million over five years to develop Australia's interstate rail infrastructure under the guise of Track Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current government says that it is committed to something similar; but it has actually taken out $133 million over the next four years from the forward estimates&mdash;a $133 million cut from the forward estimates for funding for this program. It has committed no funding at all in the current budget, the excuse of course being the Brew inquiry into Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We actually got the executive summary of that report yesterday. Interestingly enough, the first recommendation of substance is that the government should proceed with the Track Australia proposal. So why it is that this inquiry and the complications with respect to the future of the various components of Australian National is in some way a barrier to proceeding with Track Australia is a bit hard to determine. Surely that is one recommendation that the minister can proceed with, irrespective of the outcome on the other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course he has been done over. He has been done over by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), he has been done over by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and he has been done over by others in his own party who are more interested in the diesel fuel rebate. So the development of vital infrastructure which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> affects rural and regional Australia has not proceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the maritime industry we see stage 3 of the attack on Australia's shipping industry: the announced abolition of section 57AM of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This provides accelerated depreciation for Australian ships over five years&mdash;20 per cent. Almost all substantial items of capital equipment of an equivalent nature&mdash;such as trucks, crop&hyphen;dusting aircraft, bulldozers and a whole list of agricultural equipment&mdash;enjoy accelerated depreciation under the Income Tax Assessment Act as good as or better than this provision that provides for such depreciation for shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was part of the reform process introduced in the mid-1980s under the former Labor government. It was designed to ensure that labour efficiency was improved&mdash;and it has improved substantially, with crewing numbers improving dramatically on Australian ships from above 30 per ship to now about 18. It was also designed to improve capital efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also in maritime, there were great promises to the people of Tasmania about the Bass Strait freight equalisation scheme: `We will maintain that scheme and we will add in another $49 million over three years to assist with a program that will reduce the fares for passengers and cars travelling across Bass Strait, matching a promise by the former government to provide $44 million for the equivalent purpose.' What has been delivered? A cut of $32.2 million over four years in the freight equalisation scheme, which will effectively flow through to higher prices for Tasmanians on a range of products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The promise with respect to the vehicle equalisation scheme has been only half delivered: only about $24 million over three years is to be provided, which is slightly less than half of what was promised. Tasmanians have been conned by the Howard government, which promised but not delivered. As with issues like cabotage and the waterfront, they talk big, they promise lots of things, but when it comes to action and delivering they are nowhere to be found. The people who supported them and thought they might deliver <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4126"> are very quickly starting to get very disillusioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In aviation there is the question of Western Sydney Airport. When the bizarre proposal for Holsworthy as an alternative site for Sydney's second airport was first raised the very first issue&mdash;along with the specifics relating to the site&mdash;that the Labor Party raised was that this was a device to allow the government to put off expenditure on developing a second airport for Sydney into the never&hyphen;never; to delay, defer and obfuscate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the minister denied that: `No, we are still going full steam ahead. Labor was slow and was mucking around. We are going to do it straightaway; we are going to get to it.' What has happened in the budget? Some $73 million that had been in the forward estimates for this coming financial year for the development of the second airport for Sydney has gone and it does not appear in the out years. That gives us an indication of what the Holsworthy proposal is really about. It is about saving money for the government and allowing it to defer and obfuscate on the issue of a second airport for Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we move to safety and look at what has happened to the Federal Office of Road Safety&mdash;$2 million has been taken out of the public education program of the Federal Office of Road Safety. Half its budget has been obliterated. Why? It is the old conservative line that this is a function for the states. It takes you back to Malcolm Fraser's days when there was a long list of things that were functions of the states. When they were cut out of the federal arena, did they surface in the state arena? No. The end result, for all John Sharp's posturing with respect to road safety, is that all that has been achieved in this budget is cutting public education, a critical part of our road safety program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we look at where the money has gone. He has managed to achieve for people who own planes a significant cut in the price of avgas. This is the government of the battlers that is changing the Australian tax system and the provision of social welfare to make sure they look after battlers. What we have is, on the one hand, people who own planes being able to pay slightly less for their avgas and, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at the same time, the amount of money spent on road safety education is being reduced significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The backdrop to all that is the scandalous fiasco with the minister and the Board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. He is meddling daily in the behaviour and activity of Australia's aviation safety regulator&mdash;at great risk, I hasten to add, to his future position as minister. The meddling continues. In the latest aviation report we see stories of his attempt to stack the committees and to determine who will chair the committees that have been established for industry consultation on the review of civil aviation safety regulations. So the minister is continuing to meddle in these things and is not tackling the real issues that face transport in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally&mdash;the ultimate irony&mdash;we have a situation where he has presided over the abolition of the regional development part of his department. This is a senior National Party minister saying that the federal government has no role in regional development. I suggest that Sir John McEwen must be doing a few handstands in his grave as a result of that. Not only is he presiding over the abolition of regional development but the cost of redundancies in his department as a result of that decision is going to be taken out of the transport department's own administration budget. So up to 10 per cent of the total administration budget for the transport department&mdash;it is not a large administration budget; it is roughly about $100 million&mdash;is going to be paid to abolish the other part of the department. It is a disgrace and a joke. It illustrates how weak this minister has been and how much he has been done over by Finance and Treasury in this budget process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now turn to the question of the broad macro-economic picture of the budget. The critical thing about this budget is that it is a high unemployment budget. That is the overriding issue when you look at the budget. The first thing is that unemployment is not expected to alter&mdash;so they give up straightaway. It is expected to be 8.25 per cent&mdash;and that is an optimistic assessment, for reasons I will get to in a second. No targets are set and there are no targets even for the out <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4127"> years; there are no estimates for the out years in the forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labour market programs are slashed by $1.8 billion over four years, so the long&hyphen;term unemployed who can benefit by having their employability and their skills improved by that program are being condemned to the scrap heap and told, `You can stay long&hyphen;term unemployed forever.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry assistance has been slashed by an enormous amount: over $2.4 billion over four years. But that is job creating and export creating assistance. So jobs we are developing in areas such as the shipbuilding industry in Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia are now under threat as a result of those decisions. Regional development has been slashed. So the freight centre, for example, that would have gone ahead at Cairns airport and which would have created substantial numbers of jobs in the Cairns region, including in the primary industry sector, will probably not be able to go ahead as a result of that decision. The end result is more jobs lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been 30,000 public servants sacked and another 24,000 people to be cut out of Telstra; and an overall contractionary budget which will take money out of the economy at the bottom end of a soft landing at a time when we need to have a steady&hyphen;as&hyphen;it&hyphen;goes policy and when we need to make sure that the fragile degree of growth that we have as a result of that soft landing should not be shattered. The minister is admitting that the long&hyphen;term unemployed rate may rise. The latest ANZ job vacancy figures indicate that in the August period we had the lowest job vacancies since March 1994. Saul Eslake, their chief economist, who is a former member of the Liberal Party&mdash;and may still be a member&mdash;says that the government's prediction of 8.25 per cent is optimistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is just a softening up for the reality that we face in the future with respect to this government&mdash;that is, John Howard unemployment, John Howard 1982 unemployment, John Howard unemployment of 10 to 11 per cent, no improvement and long-term unemployed people, ordinary working people, the battlers that he says he represents, having no <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hope, no opportunities and no ability to look after themselves in a decent way with reasonable living standards and to look after their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to look at the macro-economic position to illustrate this point. In March the Treasurer said&mdash;he got all hairy chested; he tore open his shirt and the buttons popped off and there was the big hairy chest&mdash;`I'm going to cut $8 billion off outlays. There will be no soft options: $8 billion out of outlays.' What has happened? He has cut $5.2 billion out of outlays and taken $2 billion from the revenue side. Who has noticed this? Have any of the ultra right&hyphen;wing columnists&mdash;your Alan Mitchells and your Alan Woods&mdash;been dancing around and complaining about this? No, they have not. But that is what has happened. He has wimped his own test. He said he would cut $8 billion, but he cut only $5.2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Revenue is up by 7.5 per cent, or 4.6 per cent in real terms&mdash;a great achievement for a cutting Treasurer, isn't it? Outlays for this year are down by 0.5 per cent in real terms and 2.1 per cent in the next year. But what happens in the year after that? Forward estimates show that they are up by 5.7 per cent and a further 2.7 per cent after that. It is pretty obvious that the Treasurer understands the real impact of what he is doing&mdash;that is, that the contractionary impact will be such that growth will reduce, we will go into or close to recession and he will have to inflate the budget and he will have to increase outlays in a couple of years time to correct the damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997&hyphen;98 forecast of a surplus of $6.6 billion and an underlying surplus of $1.5 billion assumes steady growth of 3.5 per cent, but that is a very brave and optimistic assumption when you have a very clearly contractionary budget. There is no question that we need a degree of fiscal constraint. There is no question that we need to improve the fiscal position. But that involves a tight balancing act to make sure that we do not throttle growth, which in itself damages our fiscal position more than just about anything else. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4128">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can get four per cent plus growth, which would wipe out over a period of two or three years most of the deficit. We can, at the same time, reduce outlays by small amounts&mdash;by $1 billion a year or a bit over $1 billion a year&mdash;over that time and reach balance within a couple of years. What we have is a re&hyphen;run of the twin deficits theory. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister do not admit it any more because it is so totally discredited, but in reality that is what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasury is still pushing the line that savings is the cause of the current account deficit. It is not a trade problem. It is not because we do not export enough and we import too much. It is not because we do not have any decent industry policy that assists Australian exporters and high-tech manufacturers and services exporters. It is because we do not save enough. We had that theory around in the past, and it is obviously discredited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at our own history, and if you look at what is happening in countries like Malaysia and New Zealand at the moment, budget cuts might increase public saving but they will diminish private saving, which will mean that people will lose jobs and, therefore, not save anywhere near as much, if at all, and that people will have to pay more for things like prescriptions, child care, HECS and the like. Are they going to save all that? So the consequences will be negative for savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can now have a look at the actual cuts to see what in reality this budget is about&mdash;and it is a direct continuation of John Howard's track record as Treasurer in the Fraser government. The actual initiatives in the budget&mdash;and these are all over a four&hyphen;year period&mdash;are that HECS is to be increased, with a lower threshold, by $1.136 billion; university funding is down 4.9 per to $839 million; Austudy is hit and is down by $470 million; public hospitals, $800 million; child care down by $490 million; disability services, $113 million; the dental scheme, $400 million; the PBS, $402 million; Medicare changes receiving $411 million; nursing home cuts and aged care cuts, $478 million; the environment, $450 million; Murray-Darling <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Basin assistance, $93 million; legal aid, $101 million; and the ABC, ATSIC, labour market programs, road funding, as I have mentioned, and industry and regional development are all cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who gets helped by all of these things&mdash;the dental scheme, PBS and Medicare? It is the battlers that they supposedly represent, the battlers that they say we are now the representatives of, and Peter Costello's blue&hyphen;collar workers. There are not many out there waving flags for him at the moment. It is an absolute joke that the Liberal Party should ever purport to represent blue&hyphen;collar workers because it hurts blue&hyphen;collar workers and it hurts battlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can have a look at what they have not done. They have not touched the diesel fuel rebate and they have not actually addressed tax avoidance issues. The government knocked out a measly $100 million. Labor was going to knock $800 million out of the schemes that had been uncovered by the Taxation Office and Peter Costello has wimped that and said, `Oh, no, I've got too many friends involved in all of that sort of stuff, the big end of town, the people that I represent. So we'll give them a little bit of a touch&hyphen;up just to make it look good, but basically we are going to leave them alone.' Why should we be surprised? Because this is the party at the bottom of the harbour, this is John Howard, who sat on the worst tax avoidance schemes for years as Treasurer and watched the public revenue erode and who was not prepared to tackle the issue then, and they will not be prepared to tackle it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to compare this budget with the government's list of promises. They promised to maintain real labour market expenditure; to maintain all of the Commonwealth safety net concessions, such as the dental schemes and the PBS; to maintain hospital funding; to maintain Medicare; to maintain the rules with respect to HECS; to not cut child&hyphen;care funding; to maintain road commitments and spend more on other specific programs; to maintain ABC funding in real terms; to maintain Austudy&mdash;and so the list goes on. Those were the promises, those were the commitments, made by the Howard government in its period in opposition, in its period leading up to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4129"> last election. Those are all the commitments that have been broken by Honest John and his supporters. This is, as I said at the outset, a mean and nasty budget. It is&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks certainly are going to obstruction of the business of the House. On that point, let me say that there is provision in the standing orders to move motions and to call divisions. If they are to be considered disruptive, it occurs to me that there would be many occasions in this House where divisions are called without any hope of them succeeding and so could be interpreted as obstructive. Of course, that is plainly not the intention of standing orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the situation we are in which leads the chair to believe we might be disruptive or in some way impeding the normal course of business of the House arises out of a failure of the standing orders to deal with the presence of Independent members. All the speaking arrangements are predicated, it seems to me, on the issue of a speakers list. That list is merely issued for the guidance of the chair, as I am sure you are aware, Madam Deputy Speaker. It has no standing in the standing orders. It is not mentioned; nor should it be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, in other parliaments, including the state parliament in Western Australia, there is no such thing as a speakers list. People rise, in accordance with what is provided similarly in our standing orders, to seek the call of the person in the chair at the time. So this House is peculiar in that speakers lists are issued, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they are arranged by government and opposition whips, but they have no standing or credibility in the sense that they are relevant to any standing order whereas the motion I moved does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is under these circumstances that I, as do others amongst my Independent colleagues, find myself in the position where we cannot get, on any reasonable basis, on to a speakers list which the chair uses for its guidance only. So we have this really outrageous situation where up to five elected members in this chamber cannot in any formal way obtain the call of the chair if the chair adheres rigidly to the speakers list, which has no standing or force under standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I submit that on each of the four or five occasions I have tried to speak under these circumstances I was the first on my feet. I know it is difficult, if there is someone on the other side to me, for the chair to necessarily notice me in the first place, but I suspect that that is not the case on every occasion. Knowing the problem that I was confronted with, you can rest assured that I was first out of the blocks on every occasion, including this morning. The chair might not necessarily have been able to see that, particularly if it was being guided by this speakers list, which has no standing, and was looking in the direction of the member whose name appears next to speak on the list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the situation now, Madam Deputy Speaker, where the advice I obtained and was given is not to be applied on some motion that a member who rises to be heard before or at the start of the speaking time of another member is being disruptive. In itself, that cannot be disruptive, I put to you, because it is open to anyone to get up and to move that motion. I chose particularly the occasions when the previous speaker had finished to take the opportunity to seek the call in the way that I did. That is not disruptive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I submit to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that it cannot be disruptive then to call for a division on the motion. It is clearly provided for and anticipated in standing orders, but it is inherent in everything we do in this place that, if we disagree and if it is within the rules that apply to debate in this chamber, we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4131"> follow that course. It is as simple as that. That cannot be disruptive. In any legalistic sense it cannot be disruptive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I find myself in the very awkward position of having to dissent from your ruling, Madam Deputy Speaker. I believe it is quite unnecessary&mdash;in fact, I believe the circumstances that have led to this are quite unnecessary. If the Speaker had chosen, at an appropriate time when this parliament first sat, to react to the enjoiners of some of my Independent colleagues and me, a formula would have been created where we got our opportunities in accordance perhaps with the relative numbers. That is what applies in the granting of questions without notice to Independent members. It happens with allocation of speaking time on various private members debates such as the grievance debate. In fact, it is quite a normal arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you went to the extreme, Madam Deputy Speaker, and said that, by taking my full speaking time in addressing this motion, it was disruptive, we would have another set of circumstances. Yet standing orders provide for what I did in moving that I be now heard and in what I am doing now. There is no basic difference. I have acted in accordance with the standing orders. Clearly, standing order 61 has not been breached, nor indeed have you suggested that it has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By any stretch of the imagination, it cannot be considered obstructionist or disruptive to exercise a right clearly given to a member. If that right, as is the House's equal right to disagree, shapes up in the form of a division, that is how it goes. But it is not disruptive; it is not obstructionist; it is acting in accordance with a set of rules by which we are all required to abide. I will not run the risk of being further disruptive or obstructionist in the eyes of the chair because I do not intend to take my full speaking time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will effectively support the Deputy Speaker's ruling, although in this case it is technically a statement of opinion in regard to standing order 86. Madam Deputy Speaker, we appreciate the consideration that you have provided those dissentients in as much as you have allowed for them to have an opportunity to be heard on this issue, although, as you say, technically once you have formed an opinion then under this standing order that is the end of the matter. It is not technically by way of indulgence that you do so, but you have facilitated their being heard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the expression of opinion which you have articulated, the government supports the thrust of your ruling. We do so for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is quite clear that you are able to so act because standing order 86 specifically includes reference to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question that a Member "be now heard" or "do now speak".</PARA>
<PARA>So there is no question that the words of the motion that a member `be now heard' may be the subject of the words at the end of standing order 86, which allows you to come to the opinion that the motion in itself is an abuse of the processes of the House. That is the first point. It was argued the other way by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) but, on any fair interpretation of this standing order, it specifically includes those procedural motions where a member is moving that they be now heard. You are therefore entitled to form the opinion that you have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The second question is whether or not the evidence would be before the chair to allow you to form that opinion. I think that is also quite clear. The facts are really revealed in the speech of the member for Curtin. Before referring to his remarks a moment ago expressed, the chair would be aware, as an active member of the House, that this is not an isolated occasion. In fact, the member has attempted such motions&mdash;</PARA>

I know politics descends to trivia from time to time, but I must say it is not a good reflection on any member to say that they have been denied the right to speak when they have denied themselves that right because of the rather absurd propositions that they have been putting about.</PARA></TALK.START>

I sometimes wonder what the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) means when he talks about these meetings, agreements or arrangements. He mentioned in his speech the word `trivia'. I have formulated the opinion that the Leader of the House probably considers most of the activities in this House are trivial because they get in the way of the orderly running of government business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are about today is the fact that the Leader of the House has had six months&mdash;six long months&mdash;in order to resolve a matter that I, along with the other Independents, brought to the attention of the government immediately after the election. We knew this was going to happen because I, in my past service as a whip, understood the workings of the arrangements for speaking in this chamber. I knew that at some stage we were going to come to this point and, in effect, this point is merely <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4134"> the expression of members wanting to speak in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not speak specifically about the standing orders. Madam Deputy Speaker, I know that you have long studied the standing orders and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>. As you know, the speakers list is a convention that was arrived at in this place in the 1950s. Speaker Cameron, who was the Speaker at the time the speakers list became a convention, made a number of observations about the introduction of speakers lists. I refer you to page 475 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, where he observed in the first instance that it was a perfectly logical and convenient method of conducting debate. But he added that, if they were not adhered to, or members objected to the practice, the House would revert to a system under which there was no list whatsoever and the chair would call the member he thought had first risen in his place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings us then to standing order 61, the very standing order that gives any member of this chamber the right to move that he or she be now heard. It is quite clear in the standing orders, it is quite clear in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> at page 474:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When two or more Members rise together to speak, the Speaker shall call upon the Member who, in the Speaker's opinion, first rose in his or her place. The decision of the Chair may be challenged by a motion that any Member who rose `be now heard' or `do now speak' and that question must be put forthwith and determined without amendment or debate.</PARA>
<PARA>It also goes on to say&mdash;and this is a critical point because it gives some guidance to an occupant of the chair in relation to the call:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the allocation of the call is a matter for the discretion of the Chair, it is usual, as a principle, to call Members from each side of the House, Government and Opposition, alternatively. Within this principle minor parties and any independents are given reasonable opportunities to express their views.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the nub of the problem which the Leader of the House has brought on the House himself. Time and time again we have endeavoured to reconcile this dilemma by arriving at some formula that would be accommodated within this convention; but, as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such, none exists and none has been arrived at because we cannot get an agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, the only guide that a member wanting to express the views of his constituents in this place has on when to speak or to obtain the call is from the standing orders. My colleague the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) exercised his rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House may as well do as Oliver Cromwell did and call for the removal of this bauble and close the place down. In fact, he displays some of the tendencies of that authoritarian period in Oliver Cromwell's administration of the then Commonwealth of Britain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well for the government of the day to use its numbers to crush the expressions of opinion from individual members, in particular Independent members. But, at the end of the day, the community will view this place as becoming more and more irrelevant to their views and to the things they want to talk about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that the now laughing Leader of the House views all of these activities within the chambers as merely some unnecessary inconvenience in the orderly conduct of government business. I can recall the very same person in this place on the opposition benches making similar observations to mine&mdash;similar in the sense that at times the previous Labor administration mercilessly used its numbers and the forms of the House to prevent expression by members on behalf of their constituents, and we are seeing the very same process occurring here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House made the point that we have been disruptive in the processes and, in particular, he mentioned the Main Committee. I think two bills have been referred back to this chamber from the Main Committee&mdash;a right, I might say, that is inherent in the standing orders. It was quite clearly put in there, as you and I know, Madam Deputy Speaker, when the Main Committee evolved in the discussions within the Procedure Committee and then in the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In both of those cases, the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4135"> Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill, there were good grounds for bringing those bills back into this chamber because they were certainly controversial or would require amendment or divisions.

If we are considered disruptive in trying to obtain our rights under the standing orders, then there is, in my view, a very serious problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The serious problem is this: where do we go? We cannot make our representations in this chamber because&mdash;after the comments made by the Leader of the House&mdash;we are being forced to comply with a process that is not in the standing orders. Standing orders do not mention it at all. Speaker Cameron did not mention it when the list was introduced into the processes of the House.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is it written in standing orders? What does the Leader of the House use as a guide for this? Is it some sort of arrangement that he has concocted? That is not in the standing orders. The standing orders do not even mention the Chief Government Whip or Chief Opposition Whip in relation to the speaking rights of members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how could it be disruptive if a member tries to exercise his or her rights to speak in this place? If it is disruptive, you might as well close this place down because, in essence, any debate is a token debate; you can debate only as long as the government allows you to do so, throwing you crumbs of government time to put a point of view across. Mind you, even having made your point in this place, often it is ignored anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, if this place is to be relevant to the operation of the business of government and relevant to the interests of the community at large, our interests must be taken seriously. We are not debating some trivial point here. If the Leader considers it to be trivial, in my view he deserves to be consigned to the ranks of those who have anti&hyphen;parliamentarian sentiments&mdash;because this is an anti&hyphen;parliamentarian act. This is not an act of parliamentary democracy; at the end of the day, this is an attempt to prevent us from exercising our rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, you have chosen to make a ruling on this matter. Under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> a Speaker's ruling is not required. Obviously, since the debate has commenced, I have studied that point. In essence, we are objecting to a ruling which, in our view, regards any member's attempt to exercise their right to speak&mdash;having been made once and then a second time&mdash;as being disruptive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But where does the disruption line end up being drawn? Is it at once, twice, three times? Is it at once a day, twice a day, three times a day, once a week, twice a week, once a month, once a sitting, once a parliament, twice a parliament? Where do you draw the line?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By what right does the chair of this place exercise that particular judgment? If that ruling were right, any member, whether <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4136"> Independent, Labor Party, National Party or Liberal Party, could be considered disruptive purely and simply because they wanted to exercise their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that standing orders provide for the opportunity for members to rise in their places to seek the call of the Speaker. A member who has not obtained the call and who believes they were first on their feet is entitled, under standing orders, to move that they be now heard. That is entitled to be dealt with without debate or comment or amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, in making your ruling that the member for Curtin was being disruptive under the provisions of standing order 86, in essence you have provided a greater opportunity for executive government to prevent the voice of the people being expressed in this chamber. In essence, you have contributed to the overweening, overbalanced power of the executive vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis the parliament. We all know that, because of the tyranny of numbers in this place, in essence the executive runs this chamber. It runs it mercilessly, as it did under the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told at the beginning of this parliament that we would see reforms that would raise the standing of this chamber and raise the standing of the contributions of individual members on behalf of their constituents. We were told that we would see reforms that would raise the independence of the Speaker. We all sat here and said that we would wait and see what happens, that we would wait and make our judgments based on our experience. Six months have passed and I cannot see any difference between this administration's conduct of the business of this House and the previous one's.</PARA>

After all, with the weight of numbers, surely it is not beyond the wit of the Leader of the House to come to some arrangement that could have prevented this occurrence where the member for Curtin has done what is within his perfect right to do, and that is to move that he be now heard under the standing orders of this House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to support your action in allowing the dissent motion, although I have to say that I think you had the option of not doing so. We have supported you in that ruling because, obviously, the dissidents to this debate should be allowed to have their say. However, I have to say that they cannot be allowed to have their say too often; otherwise, by definition, it is a disruption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's get to the essence of this debate. As I understand it, a proposition was put to the Independents that they submit their names to the opposition whip so that they would go on a speaking list in a proportional way. Up until now at least, they have refused to submit their names for such a list.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is rubbish, I am sure you will come forward and submit your names again this afternoon. Perhaps, as the opposition whip said, some have delivered their names and some have refused. So I am half right and you are half right on that subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that is put is quite right; that is, if the House wants not to have a list, it should have the right to that expression. But you saw from the vote earlier that the great majority of the House wanted to go on a list. Why do they want to go on a list? It is because there are 148 members of the House and they each want their proportionate turn in which to speak.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, but it will soon come back to the even number that it was only a few days ago, in the same proportion that it was a few days ago. If you are not prepared to put your names on a list to get that sort of proportion right, then I have no doubt that you will be sitting where you are sitting for a long time to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as that, it was by convention the turn to speak of a member on this side of the House. When the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) rose this time, it was the turn to speak of a member on this side of the House. Therefore, if there are any conventions in this House, that is one which, on this occasion, you should have observed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to speak for the whole time that has been allotted. This debate is perfectly clear: either you are going to submit yourselves to a proportionate right to speak with everybody on this side of the House and everybody on the other side of the House, or you are not. If you do not submit yourselves to that then, no doubt, you will continue to use the tactics that you are now using&mdash;the tactics of disruption&mdash;to get your way. That will not be allowed. You may as well understand that from the beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, we support what you have done on this occasion. We hope that those Independent members who have been heard this time will now go away and think about whether they should, like everybody else, be able to speak in this House on some sort of proportionate basis&mdash;not on a disproportionate basis, every time they feel they should jump up.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy Speaker, as the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business, I would like to say that we on this side of the House support your ruling. While there probably are some points in the matters raised by the member for Moore (Mr Filing), I think your ruling was a reasonable one. Members of the House had made a decision, about 40 minutes prior to the Independents disputing your ruling, that they wished to, in effect, stay with the speakers list which the House had before it. Standing order 86 is fairly clear. It provides that a number of matters have to be put <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the House without debate. The first of those is 86(a), which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that a Member "be now heard" or "do now speak" . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The paragraph at the end of standing order 86 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should any of these questions be negatived, no similar proposal shall be received if the Speaker or the Chair is of the opinion that it is an abuse of the orders or forms of the House, or is moved for the purpose of obstructing business.</PARA>
<PARA>You, Madam Deputy Speaker, have come to the decision that this motion was moved, I think in your words, `to disrupt the proceedings of the House'. It would seem a reasonable thing to say, as it was such a short time after members of the House, by a very large margin of about 130 to four, decided that they did not want to hear the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The day that the member for Curtin gives me a vote is the day that I will give up. Madam Deputy Speaker, the opposition would think that your ruling was a reasonable ruling. Of course, if the chair continually refused to allow members to speak&mdash;I do not believe that you would do that, Madam Deputy Speaker&mdash;then the opposition would have a different view. At this stage, our position is that we think you were correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) injected my name into this debate earlier, I point out to the House that the opposition is more than willing to produce a speakers list which includes all shades of opinion for the non-government members in this House. Indeed, a number of the non&hyphen;government members avail themselves of that procedure. The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) regularly avails himself of that procedure. The member for Calare (Mr Andren) has done so, as has the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A former member for Wills, who was not very sympathetic to the Liberal Party when the previous government was in office&mdash;he was probably less sympathetic to the Liberal Party on many issues than many other members in the House&mdash;used to regularly avail <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4138"> himself of the option of having his name put on the speakers list by the previous chief opposition whip, Mr Halverson, who is now the Speaker. That worked well. Mr Halverson gave Mr Cleary and his colleague Mr Mack a go. The opposition is more than willing to give the other non-government members in this House a go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I put to the member for Moore the other day, we have got a lot of heat and not much light in this debate. The simple task is to try it. Let's try it. All members in the non-government parties who have put their names down on the list have got on the list at a time that allowed them to speak. The member for Oxley and the member for Calare have been able to speak. The member for Kalgoorlie regularly gets to speak. I say to the member for Moore: let's try this system that has been proposed. It worked in the last parliament for Mr Mack and Mr Cleary, and I am sure it will work in this parliament for the five Independents. Putting that aside, Madam Deputy Speaker, your ruling was a reasonable one, and the opposition will vote to uphold your ruling.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been good to have the opposition members voting on the same side as the government on the last two divisions. I hope they have got used to the idea and use their vote constructively to also support the 1996 budget. This is an important budget for Australia. It represents a turning point in the financial history of our country. At long last a government has taken our budget deficit seriously and has put in place a program to eliminate that deficit over the years ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most widely acclaimed feature of the 1996 federal budget has been its financial responsibility. The budget clearly indicated, for the first time in more than a decade, that a federal government was serious about living within its means. The first Howard government budget included a firm strategy to eliminate the budget deficit over the next three years and to start paying off some of the legacy of debt bequeathed by the former Labor regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an answer to a question without notice this week from me, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) confirmed that the federal government's debt is now over $96 billion and, without radical changes in policy, would have reached $120 billion by the year 2000. The federal government's debt will have risen by 600 per cent in just 10 years, including a $69 billion increase in the last five years. Labor has left this nation an appalling legacy of debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Fahey told the parliament that the $10 billion included in this budget to pay interest on Labor's debt is equivalent to half the entire health budget and all the education budget. To put it in other language: every man, woman and child in Australia will be paying around $5,000 extra in taxes every year to pay off the legacy of 13 years of ALP government.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, what shame Labor members must feel about the mess they left <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4140"> their country in after their uninterrupted term of government. Labor, of course, have been the debt kings always. It is interesting to note, if we trace the history of our country since Federation, that Labor governments have been in office for less than a third of the 95&hyphen;year history of our country but they have been responsible for accumulating over 90 per cent of the government's foreign debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have always adopted this attitude that they can spend as if there were no tomorrow and that the bankcard will never be called up. It might be pleasant in government to be going out spending money, favouring all of the groups that have supported the government parties during election times; it may be popular to give your electorate the extra goodies they so often want to receive. It is popular to raise social security benefits and to spend more on government programs, to raise Public Service salaries, to build new buildings and to ensure that the processes of government are well heeled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That may well be popular but it all has to be paid for. The bills come in. The interesting thing about our current economic crisis as a nation is that it has arisen because never before in history have we had such an extended period of Labor government. Normally, we have had three or four years of Labor spending sprees, then they were turfed out of office and a government with better management skills has been able to come along and balance the budget before our nation's debt gets out of control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this time we have had more than a decade of uninterrupted Labor rule, more than a decade of uninterrupted mismanagement. So these debts have really accumulated. The government debt is now $96 billion and the interest on that debt is one of the major items of our expenditure. Indeed, the $10.3 billion budget deficit that this government confronted on coming to office would not really have existed if we did not have to pay interest and redemption on the debts of the previous regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is paying the bills of its predecessors. In this budget we have to pick up the accounts for the spending sprees of the past. Many of the things we would like to do <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in government have got to be put on hold as we pay the bills of a previous era. Balanced federal budgets are essential to keep down interest rates and to boost investment. Already, market confidence in the government's budget strategy has produced an interest rate drop&mdash;and more are possible. The half a per cent reduction in interest rates means something like $70 a month on the average household mortgage loan. Those are very real benefits that can be built upon by continuing to balance the budget and for our Commonwealth to be seen as financially responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was impressed by the comments of Standard and Poor's, which are looking again at the possibility of upgrading Australia's credit rating. Our credit rating was reduced three times under the Labor regime&mdash;at considerable cost to all borrowers in this nation. At last the international credit rating agencies are starting to look favourably upon our country. It is important, therefore, that the strategy of this budget be carried through and that the program to balance the budget be honoured, maintained and delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, it is clear that Labor have learned nothing from their federal election defeat. Their declared intention to oppose $7 billion of budget deficit reduction measures would, if successful, destroy the prospects for restoring Australia's credit rating and destroy the prospects for continuing lower interest charges. If the government is unable to deliver on its budget deficit strategy, the repercussions for our country will be continuing high interest rates, a continuing lack of confidence in our nation's financial capability and a continual lowering of our international credit rating. It is essential that the strategy of the budget be honoured. I call upon the Labor opposition to demonstrate how important it is to maintain fiscal responsibility by supporting the key elements of our budget strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats, of course, are even worse. They propose even more wholesale hacking away at the strategy of the budget and propose even greater levels of expenditure. The Democrats are becoming something of an enigma. They promised at the election to keep the parties honest. But now they are seemingly opposing every attempt by the government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4141"> to implement its election promises. When we seek to honour our promises they vote against it. How is that keeping the major parties honest? The Democrats need to look thoroughly at their level of honesty, they need to look thoroughly at the way they portray themselves and they need to be responsible. They are elected as senators by a small percentage of the people of Australia. They have a role and they must use that role constructively to ensure that the best interests of our country are always honoured and maintained. To do that, they must also support the fundamental structure of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget is a major turning point. As the government makes a smaller call on the nation's savings, more money is available to invest in Australian industry and to prevent the sale of Australian companies overseas. This is a very important element of this budget strategy. There is widespread national concern about the level of foreign investment in our country and about the sale of Australian companies to overseas interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the gross foreign debt of our country, which currently stands at about $220 billion, there is something over $180 billion of foreign equity in Australian companies, bringing total foreign investment in our nation to around $400 billion. That is a lot of debt, a lot of allegiance we owe to masters in other parts of the world who are affecting our capacity to manage our country as we see fit. It is important for our country to get control of its own agenda again. To do that, we must rely less on borrowings from overseas and be able to demonstrate that we are able to balance our own budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming direction of the budget has been to benefit the people of Australia. It is true that in cutting expenditure there will be some pain. One of the aspects of this budget that has been appreciated by Australians has been the commendable way in which the government has at least endeavoured to share the pain evenly. Almost everyone has found that there is some little area where they will be adversely affected. But most Australians are accepting that there needs to be a little pain in our national interest, that we cannot continue to go on living beyond our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> means. Most Australians are prepared to say, `I will do my little piece so long as others are seen to also be fairly bearing the burden.' That has been one of the successes of this budget: it is seen to be fair; it is seen to be inflicting the burden of our national load evenly on all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those on high incomes are being asked to contribute more than those on low incomes&mdash;and that is fair. Business is being asked to bear some of the burden&mdash;and that is fair. Even pensioners are being asked to bear a very small part of that burden&mdash;and that is fair, too, and they recognise that  fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many benefits in the budget. There are no increases in income tax, sales tax, company tax or fuel excise. When did we last have a budget, particularly a budget after an election, where that claim could be made? Prior to the election almost every Labor government said that there would be no increases in taxes, but immediately after the election, even though they had access to the books before the election, they knew what the bottom line was going to be: almost invariably the Labor government's first budget after the election was a sorry litany of increased taxes and higher charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has not happened here. Even though the new government was ambushed by a $10.3 billion deficit, we have been able to bring down a budget without increases in income tax, sales tax, company tax or fuel excise. The billion dollar family tax package, the capital gains tax relief for small business, the private health insurance rebates, the increased tax free threshold for self-funded retirees, the retention of the diesel fuel rebate scheme and a host of other tax measures will help provide incentive and security for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not just all about tax increases, tax reductions and deficit reductions. There is a lot of good news in the budget on the expenditure side as well. There is increased expenditure on roads in this budget. It is not as much as I would like, but it is the second biggest road budget in Australian history. The task of providing a satisfactory road system for our nation is essential for our export trade and our economic future. We need to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4142"> devoting more expenditure to upgrading the road system. Sadly, over recent years, Labor has allowed our national asset, our road system, to deteriorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Programs such as the black spots program had been axed altogether. Even though fuel excise had grown almost sevenfold under the life of the Labor government&mdash;fuel's proportion of the tax receipts was growing and Tax's share of the cost of fuel was growing, in spite of that $10 billion revenue from fuel excise&mdash;Labor was actually spending less and less on roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that this budget turns that around, reinstates the black spots program and spends more money on local and regional roads. We can, at last, start addressing the enormous task of repairing our damaged national road system. But, as I said, more still needs to be done. I hope that in subsequent budgets the government can build upon its commitment to our road system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also welcome the increased funding in areas such as relationships counselling. Our country pays a very high price for failed relationships. We spend billions of dollars each year on the effects of relationship breakdowns, but the cost is not only economic; perhaps the greater cost is to our society. It is always a sad day for me when I get a call about someone with problems with the Family Court system or with the Child Support Agency&mdash;and there are of course scores of problems with the way in which those particular agencies operate. But the saddest part about those calls is that, more often than not, there is little I can do to help them, and there is little I can do to help them because there is such an absence of goodwill, the broken relationship is bitter and there is often an intense desire to get even.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real losers in all of that dispute and bitterness are not the couple themselves but, more often than not, their children, their families, their parents, their grandparents and everyone associated with them. Many lives are destroyed permanently when a relationship breaks down, so I welcome the government's initiative to provide additional funds in this area. Again, it is not enough but it is a start and a positive indication that this government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is serious about doing something to keep relationships together rather than having to always bear the cost of the failure of a marriage or family. There is so much that needs to be done in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's initiative in targeting families in this budget is especially good news. The $1 billion tax breaks through higher tax free thresholds for families with children are a very positive initiative and will be warmly welcomed. That initiative is available not just to families with high taxable incomes, not just to families with taxable incomes at all; the benefits are available to all families. So there will be real cash benefits to help families with the extra expenses they have in raising children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome especially also the boost in funding for education and for schools. The abolition of Labor's new schools policy is warmly welcomed in the community. Of course it was generally referred to as a no new schools policy because it made it very difficult for new schools to open up and to receive Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that many parents these days are exercising the option of a private education for their children. They are choosing to pay the fees to go to a school with often far inferior facilities to what is available in the state schools and where they have to work twice as hard to mow the lawn and provide the basic facilities for the school that they would never have to at a state school. They are making that decision, they are making that choice because they believe that the quality of that education is superior or because it particularly meets the needs of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is high time a government acknowledged that freedom of choice and provided appropriate support to families who choose that option. We are not neglecting the state school system. There are additional funds available also in this budget to assist state schools with their capital works and to ensure that there are appropriate programs to support the schooling system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a budget which offers hope to Australians. It is a budget that without doubt carries some pain, but it is a pain that needs to be borne in our national interest as we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4143"> work towards building a more secure and progressive future for our nation. Balancing budgets is a vital national objective. Previous Treasurers have given lip service to the importance of achieving that objective but they have rarely been prepared to make the tough decisions that are necessary to achieve that goal. This government has been prepared to make those decisions, and we are bearing that pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of that pain has been inflicted upon us by our predecessors, and they should hang their heads in shame and acclaim the fact that we are taking the tough decisions that they were not prepared to take. I commend this budget. It naturally does not include everything I would wish it to include but I hope that, as our government moves along into future budgets and into future terms in office, it will be able to deliver everything we have promised to the Australian people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer. The first Howard budget fails in the job because it does not create jobs. It cuts expenditure, regardless of the consequences. It retards economic growth and it is a budget of betrayal. It betrays the unemployed, it betrays Australian industry, it betrays families and it betrays regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on our side do not argue against getting the budget into surplus. In fact, Labor has produced the only surplus budgets in the history of this country. But creating jobs through sustained high economic growth must be the first priority. Helping those who need it, particularly the long&hyphen;term unemployed, requires an investment by the nation, as does developing the skills of the work force. Government cannot simply be about cutting costs. It has to be about investing in our most valuable asset: our people. To achieve sustained economic growth we also need a partnership between government and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of these objectives there is a vital role for government, but this budget takes the opposite path: it abrogates a role for government. In doing so it consigns Australia to lower growth and higher unemployment. If anyone needs any evidence of that today, look <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at the labour force figures just produced, where we see unemployment having shot up to 8.8 per cent, 0.3 per cent in one month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In office, Labor did pursue an active government role for government. While in office we fostered the partnership between government and industry and, in our last three years of office, the economy grew on average at 4.2 per cent each year. Compare this with the first Howard budget which forecasts economic growth of 3&half; per cent. We are going backwards. And there are the same forecasts for all the years up to the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This figure is not enough to create the conditions necessary for employment growth. The budget sees revenue rising this year by $8&half; billion and outlays by just under $4 billion. But with economic growth as per what Labor delivered, the increase in revenue would have been about $1 billion higher and outlays about $400 million less. A net contribution to the underlying budget deficit would come in at over $1 billion less than that which is budgeted for, $5.6 billion. Our scenario would also see the budget return to surplus by 1999&hyphen;2000&mdash;a longer path to surplus than the coalition's, but with stronger economic growth and better job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is not a budget for jobs. It hits the unemployed in two ways, and we are seeing the first signs of that today with the disgraceful 8.8 per cent unemployment figure. It not only retards economic growth which leads to job creation; it also slashes by $2 billion labour market programs which are vital for helping the long&hyphen;term unemployed get back to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government argues that the programs were a failure. They were not a failure. Look at skillshare. Skillshare had a success rate of 50 to 60 per cent according to Access Economics&mdash;which advised the Liberal Party before it came to power&mdash;demonstrating that skillshare contributes net savings to the budget of $80 million over three years. It has been successful on two fronts, but it is cut by 33 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NEIS program, the new enterprise incentive scheme for getting small businesses started, had a success rate of 83 per cent but its funds have been cut by 17 per cent. Even <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4144"> the good ones go; even the things that stimulated economic development and got the long&hyphen;term unemployed back into work, are to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to traineeships, the wage subsidy which is provided to employers to take on trainees has been cut. Now there will be no subsidy to companies which employ more than 100 people. This is a ridiculous distinction, and it should be removed. The decision to cut the subsidies on traineeships will retard the huge growth in the number of traineeships seen under Labor's Working Nation program. In the last year, traineeships doubled to 35,000 trainees on the basis of the massive commitment which Working Nation put in. This commitment has now been dramatically slashed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) refuses to commit to an unemployment target. But there is worse: the cuts to the labour market programs abandon the long&hyphen;term unemployed. They are to be consigned to the scrap heap, and the programs which gave them hope and a measure of self&hyphen;esteem have gone. I find it incredible that the Prime Minister is prepared to set targets for inflation and for cutting red tape for small businesses, but is not prepared to set a target for the unemployed. Is paper more important than people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister should come clean and indicate what his unemployment target is. But he knows&mdash;because Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, let the cat out of the bag&mdash;that under the coalition&hyphen;Howard budget policies unemployment will still be over eight per cent by the end of this century. That is not our conclusion but is in a report commissioned by Minister Vanstone&mdash;which the government has refused to table in this parliament, I might add; they have been running away from it all week. That report confirms an unemployment rate of 8.1 per cent by the year 2000&mdash;based on coalition policies, not on Labor policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is the reason that the Victorian budget that was handed down yesterday, for the first time in the Kennett government's term, projects no fall in unemployment. Under Labor, they got successive falls in unemploy ment, but the Victorian budget handed down yesterday says there will be no change. And why is that? Because they have a budget policy in place that retards growth and retards employment opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister not only got that report showing that they would be locked in to 8.1 per cent, but she also received advice from her own department that Labor was on track to achieve its target of five per cent. Today we have the Governor of the Reserve Bank giving evidence before a parliamentary committee confirming that the five to six per cent target for unemployment is achievable. We believe it could have been achieved. We were prepared to put policies in place to achieve it. We had made progress. We said it would take time, but we were making progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the government that promised to do more for unemployment, but it has done less. It has turned the record back, and we have seen the result today in the jump to 8.8 per cent unemployment. The report which was handed to the minister says that the coalition is on track for 8.1 per cent unemployment by the end of this decade, whereas we were on track for five per cent unemployment. There is a 300,000 job difference between what our policies would have produced and what you are putting in place. And you say you are concerned about jobs! This budget gives the lie to that argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the industry area of the budget, the reason the unemployed will suffer is not just because of cuts to labour market programs and the scrapping of Working Nation programs but also because the budget cuts support for investment in this country&mdash;the very means by which you get growth in production and jobs. The government has cut the programs. It has gutted industry assistance by almost $4 billion in this budget. This not only breaks many election promises but also ignores the significant returns to the economy from these programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to research and development, for example, are massive, but the government's own reports demonstrate the net benefit to the economy. The expenditures produce those net benefits. The Industry Commission and the Bureau of Industry Economics have found <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4145"> that the R&amp;D concessions have contributed net benefits to the economy of a substantial size. These things should not be seen as costs; they should be seen as investments in the future of the nation&mdash;a role that governments should be prepared to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One example of the programs that will go is the research and development being carried out at the Mount Lyell mine in Tasmania. This is a mine that was closed some years ago and has now reopened. They have world leading technology, which they want to develop, aimed at finding a more efficient method of extracting copper. It could work not only for copper but also for extracting other minerals as well. It would add value to our natural resources; it would mean not exporting the waste, but doing something with it here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this will not happen unless the research and development goes on. If we do not support it, other countries will. They will be the ones to get the benefit. This is not a cost to the budget; this is an investment in the future of the nation, in the future of Tasmania. If I had the time, I could go through a litany of examples of the programs that this government is cutting through cuts to research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is also scrapping the shipbuilding bounty. This is a program that Labor introduced back in the late 1980s. It has seen ships exported from this country, mostly the wave&hyphen;piercing catamarans, such as people who have been overseas would have travelled on. These are all built in Australia with support from this program. But the bounty took the industry production up by close to 200 per cent. It saw export growth of 150 per cent and jobs growth of 50 per cent. For what? An investment of about $9 million a year. Again, I say to you: isn't this what Australia should be encouraging?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Yet we had the ridiculous position the other day where the government reversed the decision in relation to the ships capital grants. It means that companies like Shell and BHP can now get a subsidy to buy ships built overseas, but they will not reverse the decision that enables ships to be built in this country and exported overseas. What sort of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lunacy is such a policy? That is why we are calling on the government in our second reading amendment to reverse this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not stop just with ships; it also goes to the book industry&mdash;the publishing industry&mdash;which is, again, somewhere where we introduced a bounty scheme, a support assistance scheme. We saw the export of books from this country grow by 200 per cent in the last 12 years. We have seen businesses grow up in many rural and regional centres. In the Victorian country town of Maryborough, for example, 25 per cent of the local work force is directly dependent upon this growth in the book industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cut the program and production goes overseas. Is this what we mean by exporting to Asia&mdash;exporting the jobs over there so that they do not occur here? That is not my view of it; it is not Labor's view of it. But production is not going to happen here unless the government is prepared to support industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget also terminates the computer bounty and the machine tools and robotics bounty. Both of those industries have trebled exports in the last five years. It abolishes the DIFF scheme, the one that Alexander Downer has come to grief over. Again, the DIFF scheme is not a cost to the budget. For every dollar spent, it returns $3.50 to the nation. The budget cuts the export market development grants scheme. For every dollar spent there, through a multiplier effect, up to $25 returns to the nation. These are not costs. They are investments in Australia. They are investments in Australia's future and investments in Australia's jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are part of the reason why Labor was able to sustain economic growth at better than four per cent. For these reasons, we will oppose the budget cuts to research and development and the abolition of the bounties. We are prepared to go out and support Australia's manufacturing industry, to support Australia's export industries and to be the champions of the clever country. All of those things have been betrayed in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The budget also amounts to a massive betrayal of regional Australia. This budget is a litany of promises made to regional Australia and broken, including $150 million cut to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4146"> regional road funding and $66 million cut to the ABC. You know they are the regions which are going to be hit hardest, because they have nothing else to rely upon. There are the cuts to regional university places&mdash;16,000 of them. How are kids in the bush going to be able to travel to the city? How can they afford it? Labor made sure the places went to where they were, and these are the places that have now been cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cut to the labour market programs will impact most heavily in regional Australia. The cuts to services&mdash;the closure of the Medicare offices, of the Department of Social Security offices, of the tax offices and of the employment offices&mdash;mean that these offices are closing up all over Australia under this government's program of reducing services to the bush. We also have the abolition of the regional development program&mdash;$150 million&mdash;which supported infrastructure programs and initiatives in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the cuts and the broken promises that impact on regional Australia; it is the philosophy. Because in announcing the abolition of the regional development program, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) said, `There is no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development.' A straight quote, I might say, out of the audit commission. But what a joke! Here is a man&mdash;the pretender to the National Party leadership&mdash;claiming that the Australian government has no role in regional economic development. If the National Party does not stand for regional Australia, what does it stand for? The minister himself is such a champion for regional Australia, he abolished the department. But the fact is that with the commitment that Labor made to regional Australia we saw important developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) admitted the other day that the cut to the 150 per cent research and development program was to ensure the retention of the diesel fuel rebate to the bush. We all know how the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) placed great reliance on winning the diesel fuel rebate. So what has happened? The budget <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has propped up Tim Fischer's leadership of the National Party by ripping a billion dollars out of smart companies and researchers. Not a very clever investment, I would suggest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is nonsense to say that the Australian government has no role in regional development. Through the regional development program we ensured an active role for the Commonwealth. Our approach, which was endorsed by the McKinsey report just after the budget but which the government has decided to scrap, was that the program should continue. It is a report that cost $700,000&mdash;that is $7,000 a day. It found that the regional development program had made a significant start in rejuvenating leadership in Australia's regions and that it had the potential to make a significant impact on the growth of regions. It recommended the continuation of funding: $50 million over five years to support the structures and $25 million over five years for `seed' funding and infrastructure funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor says that there is a role for the Commonwealth government in regional economic development. There must be a role for all governments. We have to pull together as a team, not pass the responsibility to some other level of government. All levels of government have to work together with the regions, giving them ownership. Under our strategy for regional development, we will reinstate the support for REDOs. We will provide program funding for infrastructure redevelopment. We will give regions more say in the way in which programs are delivered, and we will, in partnership, work with them to get them to identify and develop a regional agenda. We intend to win back the confidence of the regions, but unlike the coalition we will not betray them. We are prepared to back them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4147"> This is a budget deserving of the highest condemnation. It destroys the prospects for economic growth and with it the prospects for job growth. It fails to tackle the difficult problems, such as long-term unemployment. It sees the government walking away from effective involvement in industry policy in this country, and it represents the betrayal of regional Australia by a coalition government. The unemployed, Australian industries, fami lies and regions are all part of mainstream Australia, but this is not a budget for them. Accordingly, we will be supporting the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer and will be seeking to oppose those aspects of legislation that come before the House to try to reverse the ridiculous decisions; the most graphic evidence of the failure being the increase in unemployment this month. We are now seeing what the John Howard coalition government produces: high unemployment, low wages and no commitment to the future. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Contrary to what has been stated by the previous speaker, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), this is a budget for regional Australians. I should know; I represent the regional seat of Murray. I can assure the honourable member for Hotham that my regional constituents are very pleased with the way this government has not simply spoken platitudes but has directly addressed the problems. Rural people like my constituents have been working very hard with incredibly low returns and seeing their product on international markets penalised because of the industrial relations environment in this country. We are forever competing head on with countries which can produce their meat products onto markets at a fraction of the cost that we can, even though when the bullock carcass leaves the farmer it is many dollars below what their counterparts produce elsewhere in the world. So this budget is for regional Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people in my electorate and my colleagues who also represent regional Australia, such as the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), are overwhelmingly supportive of this budget. I want to add that we are not a divisive coalition. We believe in all Australians proceeding forward together. So it is no wonder that, when they had a good hard look at the budget, all of Australia has been congratulatory and relieved. This is the budget they have been hoping for over the last decade. This is the budget which will build Australia up to take its place among the world's strongest nations, beholden to no-one, with its debt pared back, with domestic <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> savings providing the funds needed to build our industry and keep it in the hands of hardworking Australians for generations to come&mdash;my children and the children of all of the others that we represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget does not make extravagant claims about reducing unemployment. The previous speaker, the member for Hotham, seemed to have a problem with that, but we are not going to mention figures because it is more complicated and more complex than that. It is much more important for us to look at a multifaceted strategy than to simply pluck a figure out of the air and then produce mickey mouse training programs so that we can show by a sleight of hand that the numbers of unemployed have miraculously been reduced. What we are going to do is create real work, not for the sake of that real work in itself but so we have an environment where business can thrive and create the jobs which give dignity and fulfilment in the lives of individuals. We will create the wealth of the nation by working hard together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget focuses on the creation of this new economic environment, where families can be more secure, where education is more accessible, where research and development will be more productive and where business can thrive. Free of unfair dismissal laws that make employing a newcomer high risk and in a flexible work environment, owners and employees will be able to work together in a workplace that is cooperative, respectful and anchored in mutual interest. No more should we look with envy at countries like Japan, where the bosses and the workers regard themselves as on the same side. We can create that environment in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $150 million per annum reduction in capital gains tax for small business is a long awaited relief and should help organisations and businesses to invest so they can compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent survey of dry&hyphen;land farmers in my electorate, over 80 per cent were using tractors and equipment over 20 years old. Too much of our other primary industry has to upgrade equipment and invest in training and product development. But they needed some hope, some sense of a future where they could compete as a result of their hard work <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4148"> and not be hamstrung by red tape and IR problems. This budget helps them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Supermarket to Asia strategy announced only an hour or so ago by our own Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is a key plank in the budget which will help regional Australia. Our Prime Minister recognises that the potential of food and fibre production in this country means that next to no&hyphen;one else in the world is able to feed the growing populations who have growing income and who are becoming more health conscious. We are close to the Asian markets. We can serve them. We are a nation that can produce clean green food. We have skilled farmer operators and skilled manufacturers. But we have to have the infrastructure, the research and development and, most of all, hope. This budget is all about hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the previous Prime Minister, Paul Keating, liked to remind us of the nearness of the burgeoning Asian markets, over the last 10 years, despite all of those statements to that effect, we actually saw the growth of Australia's market share in those food markets fall well behind our competitors, particularly our neighbours, New Zealand. We know that, even as we speak, we are battling to keep market share for our beef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will keep the export market development grants to assist businesses making their first ventures into exporting. And we recognise that tourism is a valuable and growing business in the economy and it should also be eligible for such assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget recognises the essential cooperative industry and university post&hyphen;graduate research that must go on. The restoration of CSIRO funding comes not a moment too soon. How can we talk about wanting to be a clever nation when in the last decade or so the CSIRO has been battling to survive. Our nation's research capacity was slipping away under the last government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agribusiness cannot become more competitive without adequate infrastructure and in particular it is dependent upon roads. The previous government&mdash;of which the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) was an important member&mdash;saw no need for black spot road <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> safety funding to help fix up parts of the road system which were a major danger to life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget recognises that rural roads in particular have to be adequate to sustain both regional development and to keep members of our community safe as they travel. The $149 million for road safety black spot funding will make an enormous difference, and half of this is to be allocated to rural roads. I remind the House that Labor took this funding away. So how can the member for Hotham suggest that we are not totally focused on regional development?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year in Victoria alone we have seen death from road accidents exceed last year's figures. In an electorate like Murray, where hundreds of huge milk tankers ply narrow country roads twice a day, criss&hyphen;crossing major arteries, we must have good quality road surfaces and safe intersections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only several days ago we saw three killed and seven injured in a single horrific road smash on the Goulburn Valley Highway. The duplication of this national highway is urgently required, and we look forward to federal funds from this budget to start this work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a lot of promises under the previous government but, unfortunately, very little action. This budget recognises the infrastructure needs of the entire nation, but also cuts to the core of the problems which have kept our current account deficient at levels which sapped the savings of the nation&mdash;and certainly ate away at its heart. This budget is fair and just, while it takes the hard decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a compassionate budget. In the true liberal tradition it provides a safety net for those who cannot survive unaided, because the education system has failed them, because they are too old and without savings, or too sick without savings, or disabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After years of confused regulation and rigid bureaucracy, our care of the aged in hostels and nursing homes was in no way keeping pace with an ageing population, a population with  the lives of the most frail extending well beyond the lifespans of previous generations. This budget provides for a six per cent increase in funding for the home and community care program. This will help rural <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4149"> people in particular live out their days in their small local communities&mdash;one of their priorities as they end their days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Flexibility will be introduced in the system so the distinction between an aged person's hostel and nursing home blurs&mdash;what a sensible idea, long looked for. Now the needs of the elderly person will be critically assessed and the funding will follow the individual. There will be over $130 million per year additional funds to help in the refurbishment and development of nursing home facilities. In my electorate of Murray where many small hostels need to upgrade their facilities there is a special fund that they may tap into for the facilities needed to provide nursing home accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget also recognises that most people prefer to live out their days at home. The strain placed upon carers who dedicate so much of their lives to providing for others' needs is to be taken on board and is recognised in this budget. These are the carers of the frail elderly, the chronically sick as well as those who care for the disabled. These carers are a very important part of our community and we could not do without them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Murray there are men and women in their seventies who dedicate their lives to the care of their adult disabled sons and daughters. They live in fear of the future when they may not be able to continue that full&hyphen;time care that they so willingly give. This government is compassionate and understanding. It has provided an extra $36.7 million above 1995&hyphen;96 expenditure over the next four years for a national carers action plan which will in particular extend and improve respite care in emergencies; increase the number of days a carer can temporarily cease caring in a year without affecting their qualification for the carer payment so it will be more flexible; and double the time that carers can spend in employment, voluntary work and educational training from 10 to 20 hours per week. In other words, we recognise that the carer needs also to be able to maintain their links in the community and to have some time away to re&hyphen;educate for a time when they may want to re&hyphen;enter the work force themselves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only those who have worked with the disabled truly understand how significant these changes are. In Murray, there has been up to a two&hyphen;year wait to get school holiday respite care so that the family of a disabled person can take a break with their other sons and daughters. That might not seem so much, but to a family it is essential. Marriage breakdown is an all too frequent outcome when one of the parents, usually the mother, has to devote so much of her time and emotional energy to a severely disabled child. Yet there is a two&hyphen;year wait for respite care for the family of a severely disabled child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been the case in the past that a single night's emergency respite care for a profoundly intellectually disabled child has been reflected immediately in a reduced carer's payment to the parent. We are going to be more humane, compassionate and flexible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A week ago, I briefed the Numurkah Association for the Intellectually Disabled on the new carers initiatives in the budget. This group of parents and other concerned community members have built up excellent education, training and residential services for the disabled over a period of 30 years. They know just how hard it is to provide the opportunities and support for the disabled in their care&mdash;in particular, to find them employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were very welcoming of this budget, especially the fact that it provides 1,000 new employment places for people with a disability, as well as better access to advocacy services. Open, sheltered and supported employment organisations will be eligible to apply for growth funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our government, a caring government, recognises that disabled people have a range of employment needs and interests and should not be straight&hyphen;jacketed into some department's preferred employment or supervisory model. We are not about political correctness; we are about maximum opportunities for people who have a range of capacities and interests. This budget, through its employment place creation, will see that flexibility and diversity of employment is there for the disabled.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4150">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite that very good news, the Australian Democrats have deliberately tried to alarm the public by claiming in a media release that some 34,000 people should expect to see their disability support pensions cancelled. This is a cruel tactic aimed at causing maximum distress to the most vulnerable in our community. Yes, those who were transferred from an invalid to a disability support pension in 1991, five years ago, will be reviewed&mdash;for the first time&mdash;to see if their condition has changed. Those over 55 should not be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is found that the individual is able to return to work&mdash;in other words, their health is better&mdash;they will not be left high and dry, as the Democrats have suggested. They will not be left without any means of support. They will be transferred, if they do not have any work, to an unemployment benefit; or, if they need training or other relevant support, such as the age pension, that is what will occur. To talk about 34,000 people out on the streets tomorrow is cruel and not right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A Labor Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, once promised that under his policies no Australian child would live in poverty. He even had a target year&mdash;1990. Our budget does not deal in slogans. Instead, we recognise the causes of child poverty. We are committed to ensuring that families have access to affordable child care; have assistance to buy private health insurance; and, most importantly, will benefit from the family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise that child poverty is a multi&hyphen;faceted problem and needs to be tackled from many dimensions. We are tackling the potential or real inequality at its heart. We recognise that up to 20 per cent of children leave school functionally illiterate. Their futures are blighted as they are left behind in an information driven society. There are now and will be in the future fewer jobs for the unskilled and the non&hyphen;literate. It is a cruelty to have a school system that has 20 per cent of children leaving functionally illiterate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this government's promise that every child leaving primary school will be able to read, write, spell and communicate at an appropriate level. To achieve this, funding for literacy and numeracy programs in schools <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will increase by 50 per cent to $45 million over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also recognise that many students fail to reach their potential because they simply are not aware of all the career options. This budget will tackle vocational education. It will counter disadvantage through an $80 million package for vocational education in schools, $40 million for workplace training opportunities for students, $38 million for work placement coordinators, and $23 million to implement vocational education in schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of the mickey mouse training packages offered under the previous government that did little for the long-term unemployed, this budget has provided for school based apprenticeships and traineeships to allow students to combine paid work with their secondary school certificate. Already, in our electorate, the Northern Industry Education Board has tested this model and established food technology courses which combine the final years of secondary school with industry mentoring, work experience and TAFE training. We see this type of vocation focused education and training as the hope for the future in our region where we have a shortage of skilled workers for the food manufacturing and engineering sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, many students will want to go on to university. This budget recognises the significance of that sector and, through the introduction of HECS exemption scholarships, it will help. A more streamlined Austudy program, and the potential for Australian and international students to purchase some 25 per cent of places&mdash;all of those things bring the university closer and make it more accessible to all people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By helping to establish these linkages between schools, universities and the workplace, we will be giving more hope and a better future to our children. We will be helping to create a clever country based on the sustainable growth of business and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4151"> This is a budget that Australia has welcomed. People know it is tough but we have to start paying our way as a nation. The debt burden we were building year after year was a legacy that our children would have inherit ed. This is a budget that looks to a better future and I support it wholeheartedly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the amendments to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1996&hyphen;97 moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gareth Evans. In doing so I wish to draw to the attention of the House the effects of this Liberal budget in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) made a very big deal about how his government would have the interests of Mr and Mrs Namadgi&mdash;as he referred to them&mdash;at heart when he courted my electorate during the election campaign. Despite those smug claims, Prime Minister Howard's first budget offers nothing to the residents of Namadgi. The budget offers nothing to the unemployed, it inflicts a great deal of unnecessary pain on thousands of ordinary Australians in my electorate and proves beyond any doubt that Prime Minister Howard's promises can never again be believed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The greatest failure of this budget is that it does nothing to solve Australia's greatest economic problem&mdash;unemployment. In fact, it only makes it worse. The effect of this budget can only be to take growth and therefore jobs out of the economy. Despite the deluded rantings of the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), no-one on this side of the House is arguing that the budget deficit should be ignored, but we firmly believe that it should be dealt with in a way that does not reduce growth and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Higher growth is good because it means that more jobs will be created, incomes will be higher and business conditions improved. Increased growth means less spending on unemployment benefits and more taxation revenue because more people have jobs. Put simply, the higher the level of growth, the smaller the level of cuts needed to balance the budget. But, instead of striving for higher growth, the government has miserably opted for lower growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this budget on the residents of Namadgi is dramatic. The Howard Liberal government has continued its arrogant disregard for the Canberra community by savaging the public service, starving the construction <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry and gutting higher education. During the recent election campaign the former Liberal member for Canberra went around this town promising a 2,500 limit on the number of public sector job cuts. However, thousands of jobs have already been lost directly through cuts to public programs and services. Many more jobs will be lost indirectly from the effects of lower government spending on private businesses and local communities and because the budget reduces growth, tens of thousands of new jobs that could have been created over the next two years will not now be created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has shown a punitive, short-sighted attitude towards the public service over many years. This budget is no different. The Community and Public Sector Union reports that over 27,000 public service jobs have been targeted for cutting, or have already been cut, with more to be targeted as the year goes on. The government's own budget papers state that 10,500 public service jobs will be cut from June 1996 to June 1997. This is over and above the job cuts already announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public service jobs are not the only ones being destroyed by the Prime Minister's cuts. The simple fact is that when you cut public service jobs, you also destroy job opportunities for other workers out in the private sector. In Canberra, the strength and the viability of the private sector is more dependent on the public sector and government decisions than in any other city in the nation. The growth of small and medium business in this town is reliant on certainty and stability in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inter&hyphen;relationship between the two sectors is vital. For example, the relocation of staff and eventual closure of the Tuggeranong CES office will cause local private businesses to suffer. Already, small and medium businesses in my electorate, places like clothing retailers and cafes, have had to lay off workers because of the cuts. In fact, a small business operator said to me only last weekend in the Hyperdome, `Johnny Howard said things would be better with him. Well, they're not.' </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4152">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further blow to the local economy comes from the government's decision to abandon the construction of new buildings for the Department of the Environment, the National Film and Sound Archive and the Australian Federal Police. This decision was taken despite the justified need for these buildings and the obvious positive effects the construction would have on the local economy, employment and business confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By failing to meet the accommodation needs of the environment department alone the government has incurred additional property operating costs of $1.5 million over the next three years. This is not the only example of false economy. The Australian Federal Police Association has criticised the government's decision not to go ahead with construction of the national headquarters for the AFP because the age and condition of the existing accommodation makes necessary computer and technology upgrades difficult and expensive to install.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's disregard for the ACT community is overwhelming. It seems that they want to see our national capital a true bush capital, not just in name but in reality&mdash;with no people, no buildings, just trees and a return to the limestone plains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's pre&hyphen;budget announcement of significant cuts to higher education was a pathetic attempt to con parents and students that not much had changed, that the higher education budget had only been `given a little nick', to quote a minister. This is an outrageous claim, particularly given that the coalition promised before the election to `at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants'. There can be no doubt that the proposed changes to HECS and university funding will have a big effect on current students and an even bigger effect on young Australians who hope to gain a university education. Cuts to the universities will mean a reduction in the number of government funded places. As a result, young Australians from ordinary families will miss out on places while those from wealthier families will be able to buy a place if they miss out on a government funded place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fear that Mr and Mrs Namadgi will find that paying full up&hyphen;front fees is the only way to get a university place for their child in institutions where the Howard government has cut gross funding. A crucial aspect of the proposed changes to HECS is the decision to make existing students start paying their HECS debt at a much lower income, $20,700 instead of $28,500. The lowering of the repayment threshold from average weekly earnings removes one of the key measures of fairness in the system. Make no mistake, it will lead to continued reductions in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the recent election campaign the Prime Minister promised Mr and Mrs Namadgi additional places in family day care and retention of the non&hyphen;means tested child&hyphen;care cash rebate and of the system of child&hyphen;care assistance. These commitments have not been kept either. Despite the Prime Minister's claims, many Namadgi families will find that the Liberals' family tax initiative will not cover increased costs they will have to bear as a result of the budget. For example, Mr and Mrs Namadgi on a combined income of $47,000 a year with two children in child care for 50 hours a week will have to pay $14.93 a week more, and extra if their children go to community based long day care. The Howard government's family tax initiative gives Mr and Mrs Namadgi just $7.70 a week, leaving them $7.23 a week worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point: Ms Namadgi, a sole parent earning $28,000 a year and studying one night a week, with two kids in child care for 55 hours, will have to pay $41.69 a week more, extra if the children go to community based long day care. The Howard government gives Ms Namadgi only $17.30 a week extra. She is therefore $24.39 a week worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously Mr and Mrs Namadgi had a threshold of $30 per week of income per child that the government exempted when calculating child&hyphen;care assistance. That does not count any more and will result in lower levels of assistance. If Mr and Mrs Namadgi work long hours, the Howard government is now saying they have to pay full costs once child care goes over 50 hours a week. In addition, the government has frozen the amount of child&hyphen;care payments families can receive for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4153"> next two years. At the same time they are allowing the minimum fee which Mr and Mrs Namadgi have to pay to rise. This will increase the gap between government assistance and the rate actually charged by the centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In marked contrast to these pathetic efforts of the government, the former Labor government had a long history of achievement in child care: the introduction of child&hyphen;care assistance, the child&hyphen;care cash rebate and operational subsidies for community based child&hyphen;care centres. Most importantly, child care was made much more affordable and available. The difference between Labor and the conservatives is that we actually believe in families having a choice to access flexible, affordable, high quality child care. This budget represents the first step towards undoing all those achievements. The increased child&hyphen;care costs will almost certainly make many women think twice about re&hyphen;entering or remaining in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now let us look at the government's planned creation of a new statutory authority to be known, I understand, as `the Agency'. This agency will be formed out of the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and will take on the current responsibilities of the Department of Social Security in addition to the registration, assessment and referral of the unemployed. It is intended that the agency will be established in July of 1997 and the transformation completed by December of that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal raises serious questions for jobseekers in my electorate. What will the agency actually be doing? Will the unemployed clients still be able to deal personally with case managers? How will the touch screen referral service operate? Will all referrals be given centrally from the agency or will the client have to travel to each EPE or PEPE to get their referral? It appears that the new all&hyphen;singing, all&hyphen;dancing agency will do little to actually improve services to the unemployed. Unfortunately in the case of my electorate all of the indications are that the agency will be located outside the electorate, leaving a population of nearly 100,000 people without any local service at all. I guess it is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> just tough luck for Mr Howard's Mr and Mrs Namadgi and their kids should they happen to be unemployed. We have not even talked about the elderly, the disabled and others who travel to access Department of Social Security type services in that new regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In yet another blow to Mr and Mrs Namadgi, the government has announced cuts to public hospital funding of around $1 billion over four years, which will impact on the quality of health services they can expect to receive. We already know that hospital funding grants to the states will be cut by a total of $313 million over the next four years. This reduction in funding must mean a reduction in public hospital standards and longer waiting lists. If Mr Howard's Mr and Mrs Namadgi were to take out private health insurance as the Prime Minister wants them to, it is true that they would get a rebate of up to $450 per annum. However, they are only entitled to this rebate if they fork out around $2,000, leaving them $1,500 per year worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has increased the price of pharmaceuticals covered by the PBS system by up to 20 per cent. Concession card holders, including pensioners, will pay an extra 50c per prescription, but that is not all. Concession card holders will now have to pay an extra $26 a year before becoming eligible for the PBS safety net. General patients will now have to pay an extra $2.60 for prescriptions charged at the maximum rate. This means that Mr and Mrs Namadgi, who have a child with chronic asthma, for example, will have to pay an extra $52 a year for the child's 20 PBS prescriptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Low income Australians will suffer greatly from the scrapping of the Commonwealth dental program. The program provides quality care for concession holders who are unable to afford private dental health care. The scrapping of this program will cause great hardship for thousands of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has also decided to reduce funding and introduce or increase user charges for home and community services. A pensioner who uses three hours a week of these services for home help, nursing and home meals may have to pay up to $18.90 a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4154"> week or $980 a year. Older Australians will also be hit by the introduction of up&hyphen;front entry fees to nursing homes. The average nursing home entry is estimated to be around $30,000 but there is no limit on what nursing homes will in fact be able to charge. Only part of this entry payment will be refunded when a resident leaves the nursing home. The government has failed to give a guarantee that nursing home residents or their spouses will not have to sell their homes to pay that new up&hyphen;front fee. Pensioners who do not own their own home and do not have significant financial assets may not have to pay the up&hyphen;front fee, but I ask how the government will guarantee that these people will not be discriminated against by nursing home operators who would prefer people who can pay the up&hyphen;front fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the new entry fees, nursing home patients will also have to pay a new means tested daily fee of up to $34. I understand that pensioners with private incomes as low as $50 a week will have to face that fee. How do I console the lady who came to see me after the budget in my electorate, a self&hyphen;funded retiree whose husband is in a nursing home suffering from dementia? She is losing sleep worrying about how she can maintain his existence in that nursing home should she be faced with a fee increase of something like $34 a day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, even after the undoubted joy of being courted and condoled by the Prime Minister, Mr and Mrs Namadgi have come out of this budget much worse off. They face increased costs for health, education and child care. Even after paying this huge price the budget will not solve our most pressing economic problem&mdash;unemployment. It is all very well for the government and the Treasurer to boast that their budget has been well received but as a young person said to me last week in my electorate office, `The money market, the economists, they may like the budget, but they don't happen to live in a mortgaged family house in a street somewhere in Tuggeranong'.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to make some comment on a contribution made earlier in this debate by the mem <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ber for Oxley (Ms Hanson). The member made a number of assertions and statements were made which have received wide publicity outside of this place since that speech. It seems to me that it is incumbent on members in this place to challenge some of those statements and, particularly, to put some of the facts on the record. I believe that many of the statements made by the member for Oxley were not supported or substantiated by facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am disappointed that many of our spokesmen on both sides of the chamber have chosen not to challenge some of the statements made by the member in her statement. I think it is important that somebody in this place is seen to be prepared to stand up and point out what I believe is the error of many of her statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it is not possible to deal with every single aspect of what the member for Oxley said, I want to comment on three or four or five&mdash;if I have time&mdash;in some detail. First of all, and I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, I take issue with the statement made by the member for Oxley where she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I am fed up to the back teeth with the inequalities that are being promoted by the government and paid for by the taxpayer under the assumption that Aboriginals are the most disadvantaged people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that there is any assumption about the situation of Aboriginal people in this country. There are certainly other disadvantaged people, Aboriginal people are not the only disadvantaged people, but as a group there is no question that the facts demonstrate quite clearly that Aboriginal people are the most disadvantaged people in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first fact that you can look at is life expectancy. Life expectancy is conditioned by a number of factors whether it is infrastructure, housing, health, employment or whatever. If you are a non-Aboriginal male child born in Australia this year&mdash;and I have grandchildren who have been born in this country and I had another grandchild born this year&mdash;then compared with an Aboriginal male child born in this country in 1996 you have an 18-year better life expectancy. An Aboriginal female child born today compared with a non&hyphen;Aboriginal female child born today in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4155"> country has a 15-year less life expectancy. That is the first, hard, crushing fact of life for the indigenous population of this country, and it is a factual piece of information. There is no assumption about Aboriginal groups being disadvantaged, it is very factual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the health statistics such as the rate of diabetes in Aboriginal women. If we look at the rate of middle ear infection, in many Aboriginal primary schools up to 50 per cent of the children in those schools have middle ear infections. That means that they not only have a health problem, it means that they have an education problem as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no other school outside of the Aboriginal community in this country that has got health statistics of that type. It is not uncommon, because of a lack of infrastructure&mdash;clean water, clean housing, sanitation and so on&mdash;to find that all the health statistics in many Aboriginal communities are quite appallingly below those of other areas of our community. When we look at education, at the number of children in the Aboriginal community who get a good education, we find that the numbers are appallingly behind those of the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at housing: you travel to many of the Aboriginal and indigenous communities in this country and you will find that the overcrowding in housing is really quite disgraceful and is in fact only comparable often with the most appalling conditions in the Third World countries of this globe. I have said in this place before, for example, on trips that I have made to Aboriginal communities, it is not uncommon to find 20 or 30 people living in a house. In fact, in one community I went to in the Northern Territory, there were 38 people on average living in a three&hyphen;bedroom house in the 200 houses in that community. Can you imagine 38 people living in a three&hyphen;bedroom house, with one toilet and one shower, in a hot climate. It is appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nowhere else in this community or in this country where those sorts of housing numbers in fact apply. Three years ago the Industry Commission did a study on Aboriginal housing and they came to the conclusion that we required to spend over $2 billion just to bring Aboriginal housing up to the standard <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the rest of the community. So how could anybody possibly say that the Aboriginal community is not disadvantaged in terms of housing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at employment&mdash;and we talk in this place about employment regularly&mdash;we talk about the appalling state of the unemployment rate, which is stuck at about eight per cent. We would all like to see that improved. We may argue between the two sides of politics about how we should go about that. But the reality is that in Aboriginal communities in the length and breadth of the country, even in good times, unemployment rates are usually stuck at about 80 per cent. In many Aboriginal communities, we actually say to that community, `Don't just accept the dole, go on to the CDEP scheme', which is a scheme that I support, but it is a work for the dole scheme. I think that has many advantages, but we do not require that of non&hyphen;Aboriginal people in this country. It seems to me that, there again in employment, they are a specifically identifiable group that, in fact, are disadvantaged compared with the rest of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then of course we can get on to looking at the legal system and the representation in gaol. The truth of the matter is that if you are a 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Aboriginal youth and you come from Western Australia, you are going to be more than 50 times&mdash;five zero times&mdash;more likely to be in custody in one form or another than if you are a non&hyphen;Aboriginal youth in the same age band. I am not saying that if an Aboriginal youth commits a crime, they should not be locked up. But what I am saying is that, when you get into the areas of criminal activity or substance abuse and so on and so forth, those are usually products of the environment in which you have been brought up and the socioeconomic deprivation that you have suffered. Because Aboriginal kids suffer greater socioeconomic deprivation than the rest of our community, they tend to be overrepresented in our legal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then of course you can get into the whole area of substance abuse. Again, it is not a racial thing. Across the world, in eastern Europe, in particular when the Berlin Wall came down, they found in eastern Germany&mdash;and since the USSR crumbled, they found in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4156"> Russia&mdash;that, because of socioeconomic factors, crime is rife and substance abuse is rife in many of those countries. Amongst the areas of our community in Australia where substance abuse is most rife is the indigenous community because of the socioeconomic disadvantage that they suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality of life is that in this country over the last 10 years, certainly over the last 50 years and probably over the last 200, we have tried a number of measures to deal with the disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal people. We have tried full integration, we have tried full assimilation, and the reality is that it did not work. Therefore, we have to say that, as for any disadvantaged group in our community, whether it be the handicapped, whether it be the mentally ill, or any other identifiable group, special measures are needed. The evidence is there that special measures are needed for the indigenous community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have criticised the former government for its failures in this area. I have acknowledged publicly its good intent but I believe that it did not make much difference, in the 13 years it was in government, to the situation of Aboriginal people. So we need to look for new ways. Just abolishing special programs and saying that these people have to be treated the same as everybody else has been demonstrated to be a failure in the past. If it is tried again in the future it will be a failure again. We have to recognise the cultural differences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley, in her speech, complained that the Aboriginal people say, `This is our land.' To this she said&mdash;and again I quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, where the hell do I go?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is that she does not go anywhere. She sits pat. Freehold, leasehold, whatever land you and I, Mr Deputy Speaker live on, or the member for Oxley, or anybody else in this chamber, is totally unaffected. We have a legal basis on which we stay on the land we are on and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous. Nobody is going to move any non&hyphen;Aboriginal person off their land as a result of the native title legislation or as a result of the land acquisition fund or any of those things.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about native title&mdash;and this is the context in which the member for Oxley raised the matter&mdash;we are talking about land that was originally owned by Aboriginal people and has been recognised by the courts as still vacant crown land to which they may have a claim, providing they can prove continuing association over the last 200 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again the other side of the chamber and our side of the chamber may have differences of views as to how that legislation is being implemented and whether it is effective. There is no doubt that so far the only people to have benefited since the legislation was passed have been the lawyers. Not a single Aboriginal person has got a piece of native title land. But to suggest that because of things like native title we are all going to be kicked on, frankly, is scaremongering of the base kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley said also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I draw the line when told I must pay and continue paying for something that happened over 200 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a popular line in some quarters of our community, that we are paying for the damage that was done 200 years ago. Anything that this parliament does, and any money and programs that this parliament may decide to put in place in respect of disadvantaged people in our community, has nothing to do directly with what happened 200 years ago. It may be somewhat of an inheritance but what we are talking about is trying to fix the problems that are here today. I recounted earlier a number of the disadvantage factors for the indigenous community. We are trying to address some of those factors, as we should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting, on a more minor mundane matter perhaps, but one which I think needs to be challenged, that the member for Oxley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those who feed off the Aboriginal industry do not want to see things changed. Look at the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. Members receive $290 a day sitting allowance and $320 a day travelling allowance and most of these people also hold other very well paid positions. No wonder they did not want to resign recently!</PARA>
<PARA>Let me inform the member for Oxley that I am a member of the Council for Aboriginal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4157"> Reconciliation. I am the government nominee and I have been the coalition nominee for the last five years. The fact of the matter in terms of how the council functions is that the rates that are applied are the standard rates for any government body of this type. I have not heard the member for Oxley come in here and complain about the rates in respect of any other body, only the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She might be interested to know that members like me, who are on the government payroll in other respects, do not get sitting fees. She might be interested to know also that many members of the council from outside of the government payroll choose not to take their fees or their TA, or donate it to their employer organisations or back to the process. In fact, very few take their sitting fees and/or their TA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that the 25 people who are involved in that council meet four times a year as a formal council, plus other committee meetings and other activities on behalf of the council on a regular basis, and we meet at weekends. I have to say that I do not regard the fact that I have to go and stay in a hotel and I get a bit of TA which might give me an extra $50, perhaps, over my hotel bill as recompense for having to spend four of my weekends a year away from home. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as the other members in here would know, we spend enough time away from home. We do that because we believe in what we are doing, not because we think we are on the gravy train.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley went on to say that reconciliation is everyone recognising and treating each other as equals and everyone must be responsible for their own actions. Exactly. When we treat indigenous people in this country like that, we will not have a need for organisations like the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, but the reality is, of course, that we do not treat them like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having talked about Aboriginal people, I want to raise another issue. The lady from Oxley said, `I believe we're in danger of being swamped by Asians. They have their own culture and religion and form ghettos and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do not assimilate.' I say that is factually untrue and I challenge her to produce any substantive evidence. Of course there are migrants of all shapes, sizes, colours and hues that come to this country who may not be successful in our community, but there are thousands upon thousands upon thousands of immigrants that come to this country, including Asian immigrants, who do extremely well and make major contributions for the benefit of our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at some of the doctors, the heart doctors who are Chinese. Look at some of the Asians that we have in engineering and science. Look at some of the Asians who do so well in business or in sports. And what is wrong with coming here with your own religion? Do we say to the non&hyphen;Asians in our community that they cannot choose their religion? The very basis of our democracy is that we have freedom of choice of religion. How can you criticise people coming here from whatever their background about having their own religion? How can you criticise people, saying they all live in ghettos, when in my electorate alone people who are immigrants, including Asians, are spread right throughout the community and they are integrated into the community outstandingly?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government introduced and we have continued a system whereby we give scholarships to the 500 highest achievers in the academic system at the end of the school year. In the last couple of years most of those people tend to have been Asians in my electorate. Those people are contributing, they are involved and they are doing an outstanding job. To make the sorts of comments the member for Oxley made is, quite frankly, nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley also talked about overseas aid. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this financial year we will be spending at least $1.5 billion on foreign aid and we cannot be sure that this money will be properly spent, as corruption and mismanagement in many of the recipient countries are legend.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no question that corruption and mismanagement in many of the recipient countries is absolutely appalling, but the reality is that the amount of money we spend <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4158"> is something like 0.2 per cent of our gross domestic product&mdash;a minute amount of the overall budget. When you go to some of the other countries around the world and you see the conditions that millions of people are living in, for a country like Australia not to have the charity in its heart and the goodwill to actually try to get out there and help some of those people&mdash;if we cannot do that, I frankly think we should pack up and go home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just came back from a delegation to India and Pakistan and some of the conditions in those countries are quite appalling. It is not the individual's fault. I went to a slum in one of those countries where people live in the most appalling conditions, conditions that we cannot even conceive of in this country. If we cannot afford to spend a small fraction of our wealth, which is still considerable in spite of all of our many economic difficulties, on helping those people, I think it is quite appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Pakistan, I went to a project where we were helping young children and where in fact this government has just cut back on our aid, as all members of this place will know. I would have to say that it was one of the elements of the budget that I would personally probably have wished to see turn out differently. However, I am not going to argue about that at the moment. But the reality is that we cut back on our aid and one of the projects that I went to see is not going to get its funding next year. There were children in this project that we are directly funding&mdash;not channelling through some government official so that it is all being syphoned off&mdash;where we have people on the ground, where we are supervising the project, where we are making sure that we pick the people who work in there and where every single dollar that we are donating in aid is actually having a direct benefit on the poor of this world. It seems to me that if we cannot do that, frankly, I would not want to be in this country or in this parliament. It is something that we have a moral obligation to undertake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley talked about a whole range of other things. She talked about the Child Support Agency, she talked about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the economy, she talked about national service&mdash;I might add that the green corps is a form of national service&mdash;but it seemed to me that the speech was riddled with no research, no facts, very little logic, nothing constructive, generalisations and simplistic solutions that have been proven in the past not to work. It might strike a chord with some, but it seems to me that she does neither the House, her electorate nor this country any service by making those comments. I oppose her views. I will challenge them and I will rebut them at every opportunity because I believe that is one of the reasons why my electorate has sent me here.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(1.36 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). In doing so, I intend to comment on what essentially are two separate budgets introduced by the Howard government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first budget, cynically and deliberately introduced in electronic media and various press statements, was clearly designed to lessen the public outcry at the many broken promises and cuts to major government programs and services that had been introduced during the period of the previous Labor government. These included cuts to Aboriginal programs, cuts to labour market programs, cuts to the ABC, and cuts to the better cities program, which will have a devastating effect on electorates such as Greenway where we have such a new area and we need to have infrastructure development. The fact is that the Blacktown railway station, which is a great asset to the travelling public of western Sydney, was built under the better cities program. But we also had cuts to new migrant programs, cuts to higher education and the closure of government offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Put simply, Mr Acting Speaker, we heard a lot more about the 1996 federal budget prior to 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 20 August than we heard on the night or have heard since. This attempt to lessen the public outrage by deliberately announcing budgetary&hyphen;type decisions prior to the actual budget speech is a clear breach of Westminster tradition. This tradition <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4159"> is that there is no official statement by the government of the day about budgetary decisions until the budget speech itself. This practice was enshrined in the Westminster system of government by the British Labour treasurer, Hugh Dalton. When he discovered that he had unintentionally breached this custom prior to delivering his 1947 budget to the British parliament, he offered his resignation to the Labour Prime Minister of the day, Clem Attlee. If the government ministers opposite were to follow this fine practice there would be very few of them left and I believe that the people of this country would be a lot better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all the broken promises and cuts announced in this budget, the $1.8 billion cut to labour market programs was the most callous. It was callous because the government has said, `Yes, we have high unemployment. No, our policies are not going to reduce unemployment dramatically in the short term. High unemployment is going to continue into the foreseeable future.' They are right because only today we have heard that there has been an increase in unemployment from 8.5 per cent to 8.8 per cent. So what is the government going to do? They will wind back labour market programs and over time pass the responsibility of getting Australians back into the work force over to private enterprise&mdash;that is, unemployment is to join the profit queues of the rich and greedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question I ask this government is: what happens to the unemployed during this lag time between winding back labour market programs and the coalition government's policies being enacted? Clearly the responsible and humane way to go would be to retain existing labour market programs, while ever we have this high unemployment, until new programs, if in fact they do work, come into place. But, no, the government is asking the unemployed to suffer further humiliation and financial hardship. Why? Because deep down the Howard government really and truly believes that there is a group of people out there who do not want to work. While the government experiments with some new&hyphen;fangled policy of developing a profit making growth industry out of getting people back <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into the workplace, I am making a special plea on behalf of the unemployed in my electorate of Greenway for the government to reconsider its decision not to fund the Skillshare organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ironic that the first public duty that I performed after the budget speech by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), which announced the $1.8 billion cut in labour market programs, was to address a graduation ceremony for a skillshare organisation in my electorate. At this function some 25 job seekers received certificates for completing courses in building trades, hospitality and computer operations. What impressed me most about this function was the family atmosphere, the friendly atmosphere that existed, where people were made to feel good about themselves and good about their achievements, where their confidence had been restored and where they had been put in the right frame of mind to seek employment successfully. Where is the confidence of the unemployed people going to go now under this government's policy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was able to report to this graduation function that the skillshare program was able to boast a 63 per cent success rate, with some 47 per cent of skillshare participants going into permanent employment and a further 16 per cent going on to further vocational training. I was able to report also to this function that the Skillshare organisation is very cost&hyphen;effective. For a figure of about $1,000 you turn a social security recipient into a job seeker, who in most cases turns into a taxpaying local consumer of goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, has conceded that skillshare is not a labour market program but is a `generally high quality infrastructure'. It was, and it remains, good for Australia and Australians. The government should think long and hard before it finally withdraws funding from this piece of high quality infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to cuts in higher education. The government's decision to increase the HECS payment for new university students and the decision to start repayments at a lower annual salary will mean that many children from working class families in the west of Sydney <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4160"> will be denied a university education. This additional financial impost on students and families through reductions in Commonwealth finances and increases in fees will impact on the access that local students have to a wide variety of courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, it will impact most critically on new universities such as the University of Western Sydney, which is only now developing links with local industry leading to increased employment opportunities in western Sydney. The UWS is the jewel in the crown of the education network in western Sydney. It serves an area that has 40 per cent of Sydney's population but it can offer only eight places per 1,000 people, while the rest of Sydney has 32 university places per 1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Deryck Schreuder, Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, has been most outspoken about the cuts in funding to higher education. He is quoted in the local <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blacktown City Guardian</EMPHASIS> newspaper as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real level of cuts to UWS will be 15% over the next three years including long overdue salary increases to staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a serious blow to the youth of western Sydney because the university could lose over 1,000 places in a region critically short of opportunities in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Schreuder went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also a serious blow to business and industry in greater western Sydney where the university is the second biggest employer in a region where employment is a major issue.</PARA>
<PARA>Again I quote Professor Schreuder:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government's decision to attack the tertiary education sector will seriously handicap Australia at a time when it is economically, technologically and culturally competing in the world arena and for young universities such as ours cuts could not have come at a worse time.</PARA>
<PARA>Students in my electorate like Gunjan Aggarwal, whom I spoke of in a member's statement this week and who had an outstanding success in the 1995 higher school certificate, with 99.8 per cent, will have to travel considerable distances to attend other universities in Sydney to complete a degree in medicine, engineering or law. This new fee structure for higher level degrees will force many of these young constituents of Green <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> way to seek alternative careers, and far less satisfying and stimulating careers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give the final say on this issue to a constituent of mine, Mr Terry Fendick, who wrote to me on 17 August. While we have heard from the other side how good this budget is, we have had very few hard facts about what people in the electorates are saying. Well, here is what a person in the electorate of Greenway is saying about the cuts to higher education. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Friday (9 August 1996) the federal government announced a crushing blow to potential tertiary students of limited means. My daughter is one such person who was hopeful of gaining a tertiary placement in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up until that Friday she was preparing herself to accept many long, hard hours of dedicated study plus the cost of student union fees, writing materials and many, many reference/text books, and after all that emerging from an extremely intense four year university course with a $10,000 HECS debt. However, now she is devastated having to face a HECS debt of nearly double that previous repayment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suppose my daughter and many like her would have accepted a twenty or even thirty per cent rise in their HECS commitment, but double seems to be unfair and unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government seems to have taken a shallow view of university funding and in the long term may regret this decision when it is forced to recruit professional expertise from overseas because it discouraged highly motivated students in Australia from seeking further education.</PARA>
<PARA>That says quite clearly what I am sure a lot of people out there, the battlers in western Sydney and in other electorates, are saying. To add to that, I will quote from another letter from a constituent of mine, a Mr Steve Adamantidis of Kings Langley. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reeling as I am by the callousness of the Howard/Costello budget, the brunt of which will be carried by people like me and my family (being in my 50s on a disability support allowance and having a son at uni) which will be severely affected both by the cuts to the pension criteria and the unemployment allowance criteria as well as increased HECS repayments and not getting any of the benefits like rebates for health insurance or child allowances.</PARA>
<PARA>That letter is from another western Sydney battler speaking on this Howard budget.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4161">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn now to another very important issue in my electorate, the issue of child care. Under the previous Labor government the Blacktown local government area was approved as a high need area for new community based long day care places, family day care places and outside school hours places. Under Labor, western Sydney had 361 places for every 1,000 children compared with the New South Wales average of 326 places per 1000. Blacktown also had the highest relative level of long day care supply in western Sydney. Under Labor the availability and affordability of child-care facilities increased considerably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this will disappear under the coalition's heartless cutbacks. The removal of the operational funding for community based long day care centres will seriously affect young families who send their young children to community and council operated child-care centres. Blacktown Council operated 20 long day care centres. These centres were operated on a break-even basis. Fees are set taking into account all forms of operating costs. There is no profit from the service and all surplus funds are returned to keep fees at a minimum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the council is to provide the same level of child-care service, fees for children attending long day care centres will rise by $23 per week, a hugh amount for the battlers of western Sydney, taking the fee to $161.50 per week. Any fee increase will have a major impact on young, working families. It will force one parent to leave work to look after their children or else force parents to pay higher fees. Either way, this decision is going to have a major impact on Mr Howard's western Sydney battlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community child care carried a greater share of the more expensive areas of child care : under two year old, disability and at risk children. Low&hyphen;cost community child care is most likely to be the only option for parents in less well-off areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now move to another area, aged care: the aged is another group which has done particularly badly out of this budget. This is extremely disappointing because Aged Care Australia made strong representations to all candidates prior to the March election. I recall receiving correspondence from them and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> personal representations. They drew attention to the growing problem of dementia within our society and the need for additional money to maintain or replace aged care buildings. They also referred to the need for increasing finance to cover spiralling costs of daily care of nursing home residents. With our aging population more people are making use of community care. Additional funds are urgently needed in this area also. We simply cannot wish these problems away or try to dump them on charitable groups. It is our collective responsibility to accept this challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aged Care Australia in their pre&hyphen;election representations sought urgent government action to develop in 1996 a new scheme to assess the unique care required for people with dementia that better reflects the additional cost of providing care in hostels, nursing home and community care packages. All candidates were advised that there are presently over 240,000 people with dementia throughout Australia and the number is growing. While most people with this illness live in the community there does come a time when family carers have to seek respite care in a nursing home or hospital. At this stage governments have not recognised that people with dementia need additional personal care over and above what is already provided in a nursing home or hostel. Increasing numbers of people living in nursing homes and hostels have moderate to severe dementia. What did aged people and the aged care providers get in the budget? Firstly, they got a pretty big fright. This fright was in the proposal that people who are not on a pension would have to pay an up-front fee of&mdash;and the figure here is not clear but certainly we could say&mdash;$30,000 upwards which is negotiable. These are people who were not on a pension. Entering a nursing home necessitated, it was first suggested, the sale of the family home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received several letters from people who were still in the work force who were supporting a sick partner either at home or in hospital. The question these people were all asking was, `Where will I get the up&hyphen;front finance to get my partner into a nursing home. Will I have to sell the family home?' Political expediency rather than a caring heart <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4162"> has caused the government to reconsider this proposal. What else did the needy section of our community get out of the budget? The residential aged care system will be put into reverse with a deteriorating system having no funds available for new capital works, replacements or upgradings in 1996&hyphen;97. The promise of special funding for dementia patients to apply from 1 January has not been honoured. The most unkind cut of all, Mr Acting Speaker, was the withdrawal of the in-principle funding for some 87 new nursing homes in New South Wales; and at least one nursing home in my own electorate, the Holy Family Nursing Home at Marayong, has been affected this way where they did have an in-principle agreement under the previous government to provide 11 new beds. So as not to interfere with the forward planning, it would have been expected that any reasonable government would have at least honoured existing agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members opposite in the debates I have heard so far, Mr Acting Speaker, have tried to suggest that in this area of aged care that the public has accepted the government's proposal but I would suggest there has been quite a deal of criticism and I will refer to this particular article which was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Catholic Weekly</EMPHASIS> of last week. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aged care row. Concerns for nursing homes. Proposed restructuring of aged care system by the government has been met with criticism by church and charity groups.</PARA>
<PARA>If I could just quote from this article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also planning to drop strict auditing requirements that ensure the money is spent on patient care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Francis Sullivan, executive director of the Australian Catholic Health Care Association. . . , said, `The Government has taken away a very strong regulatory requirement that ensures government money is put in for care.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said one of the primary differences between hostels and nursing homes is hostels are generally run by church or charity groups while most nursing homes are run by private operators for profit.</PARA>

<PARA>I am quoting Francis Sullivan&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">poorer areas, such as western Sydney, will suffer.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, Mr Acting Speaker, it is clear that this budget has been prepared by bean <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> counters, authorised by bean counters and delivered by bean counters. It has no soul, no feeling and no hope for Australians generally. It is a disappointment, true, but it is really a disaster for every needy person who used to rely on government&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, the first budget of the coalition government lays the foundations for a better future. Despite the many legacies and problems left to all Australians by Labor, the Howard coalition government's first of many budgets is a sensible package of repairs and positive initiatives for the future. The budget is the first step in ending the Labor fantasy that they could somehow `belt the Bankcard' year after year to fund unsustainable levels of expenditure. The twentieth of August 1996 was rejection day for the Labor notion that current-day excesses could simply be passed on to our children as debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's last dishonest legacy to the Australian people was a $10.3 billion budget deficit, a deficit that the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) thought was going to be a surplus&mdash;a $718 million surplus&mdash;a surplus he assured Australian voters that his government was on track for; a surplus that proved to exist only in his imagination; a surplus that the same officials at his fingertips later informed a conscientious coalition Treasurer was not a surplus at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the smoke and mirrors were cleared, Australians were greeted with the Beazley black hole. Labor's phoney and fudged claims of surplus simply disappeared. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition's ability to make a surplus disappear to reveal a whopping big deficit made him look like the David Copperfield fiscal magician of this House. In fact, you could almost see the transformation of a Labor dodgy surplus to  more deficit and more debt for Australians to bear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there was more to the Leader of the Opposition's `Copperfield Combo'. This surplus he assured us all was there was resting, like a trophy to Labor's deficit reduction strategy, on the fiscal credibility of the member for Brand (Mr Beazley). There it was. You could almost see it. And then, with a wave of coalition budget honesty and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4163"> accountability&mdash;puff!&mdash;it was gone. Not only was the surplus gone to reveal a huge budget deficit, but so was the Leader of the Opposition's fiscal credibility. It just vanished. There was a $10.3 billion budget deficit just left hanging there, an opposition leader without fiscal credibility and a disgraced Labor Party with no idea of how to approach one of its ugliest creations. It was not a pretty sight, Mr Acting Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a legacy left by Labor to be repaired by the Howard coalition government; a repair job that Labor can only snipe and gibe at; a fiscal restoration that Labor cannot contribute to and can barely comment on, given the credibility-free zone the opposition leader created through his `Copperfield Combo'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economics commentator Christopher Gosselin said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 21 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether the Opposition or Democrats like it or not, the country cannot afford to continue running at a deficit. To do so undoubtedly puts pressure on interest rates. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to see that the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot, agrees that to prevent the passage of appropriation bills is a recipe for economic chaos. The budget is a $7.2 billion two&hyphen;year turnaround in Australia's finances. Apart from helping families, the other clear aim of the budget is to cement in the gains that have recently allowed interest rates to fall half a percentage point. Mr Acting Speaker, this has already meant an extra $65 a month, cash in hand, for families in the electorate of Dunkley, who hold an average mortgage of $100,000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, I thank the re-elected member for McEwen for that question and I place on record my appreciation and the appreciation of the government for the interest that she has taken, as a person representing a regional area of Australia, in the government's initiative that I first outlined in November last year as Leader of the Opposition to the National Farmers Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased about the establishment of the prime ministerial council, which is to be chaired by me and which is to include four senior ministers: the Deputy Prime Minister; the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy; the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism; and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I am also happy to say that the council includes Mr Reg Clairs, the Managing Director of Woolworths; Mr Murray Rogers of the Australian Food Council; Mr Donald McGauchie, the President of the National Farmers Federation; Mr David Mortimer, the Managing Director of TNT; Mr Malcolm Irving, the Keating government's appointment as Chairman of the Australian Horticultural Corporation and a well&hyphen;known Sydney merchant banker; Mr George Kailis of the Kailis group; Mr Garry Ringwood of Amcor Ltd; Mr Joe de Bruyn, the National Secretary of the Shop, Distributive and Allied <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4165"> Employees Association and a very respected trade union leader; and Professor Adrian Clarke, the Chairman of the CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very representative group. The goals of the council are important to the future of agriculture in this country. I believe this is one of the most valuable initiatives for rural and regional Australia that has been launched by any government in this country for some years. I hope&mdash;there is reason for that hope by virtue of the attendance of the opposition spokesman on primary industry, the member for Perth, at the launch of the council today&mdash;that the council does draw the support of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total east Asian food market is projected to be $685 billion by the turn of the century. Eighty&hyphen;three billion dollars of that is met by imports. Food processing is the largest manufacturing sector in Australia. It is now 20 per cent of manufacturing turnover and it is growing at five per cent a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The combination of the enormous economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region plus the natural population increase and the tremendous surge within that population increase in the size of the middle class in Asia&hyphen;Pacific countries, which naturally carries with it a larger demand for more varied and more sophisticated foods, means that if we can marshal our resources in an effective, competitive fashion there are great opportunities to be won for regional and rural Australia from this particular initiative. I believe that the presence on this council of so many people with varied interests and the cooperation of the interests that they bring will guarantee that this will be one of the most valuable initiatives ever undertaken by any government in Australia. It lays down a sound foundation for the future economic prospects of people living in rural and regional areas of Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are backing away already. You know you are. The information required to be supplied by superannuation funds to the Australian Taxation Office should not be significantly more than they already require for the proper management of members' accounts other than the requirement to provide tax file numbers. Legislation prepared under the previous Labor government and currently before the Senate will enable superannuation funds to request tax file numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of defined benefit superannuation schemes and unfunded schemes, the government has announced the establishment of an actuarial advisory committee to advise by 31 October 1996. The surcharge on higher income earners will involve certain changes to administrative procedures, with most of these falling on the ATO and superannuation funds. The costs are a necessary part of providing a fairer system. The changes are prospective. They provide the opportunity to streamline the administration of superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Taxation Office is consulting widely with the superannuation industry to ensure the new arrangements are introduced in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. Of course there will be some up-front costs in designing the new systems, but every effort will be made to ensure that the costs do not actually increase more than is necessary and do not provide additional costs to those who are not affected by this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Electronic commerce is the key to ensuring the proposal works efficiently to bring about efficiency in superannuation in the area of information exchange. Suggestions that it would be more efficient for the Australian tax office to deal directly with around 8,000 employers rather than the 140,000 complying superannuation funds are dubious, and these would not take account of privacy considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it entirely clear that this is a fairness measure. This is an equity measure. Full consultation will be undertaken to introduce it. It will improve the operation of superannuation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous Labor government that devised the business plan from which these reports now emanate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is a very interesting proposition to consider as to how much did the previous government inform the workers of AN and the public of Australia about the business plan that it had developed for AN which has now led to these proposed measures possibly being undertaken. Both the former Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford-Smith, and the former Minister for Finance were well aware of this business plan last year as it was developed. Indeed, there was correspondence from the former Minister for Finance congratulating AN for the business plan that was under way at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, it is an interesting proposition to put to the House as to how much of the truth about AN's plans did the former government reveal to the workers of AN and to the people of Australia. For example, when the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the former transport minister, the member for Kingsford-Smith, visited AN's workshops at Islington during the election campaign, did they inform them that they had developed and were approving a business plan which would lead to 950 job losses in the next financial year or indeed which would lead to the sale of parts of AN's business? Did they inform the workers at AN's workshop of that when they spoke with them? No, of course they did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It proves the very point that I was making in the House yesterday: the previous government deceived and betrayed the workers at AN over the future prospects of AN, as indeed it deceived the public of Australia. This government has inherited that problem and it is this government which will resolve it to the satisfaction of all Australians. But you can rest assured that, if the previous government had been left in office after the 2 March election, the workers at AN would have realised the betrayal of their Labor colleagues in the administration of their business.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is deeply committed to strengthening our bilateral relationship with India and has already signalled that commitment to the Indian government. As I pointed out to the House yesterday, we do not want to let the differences of view we have had with India over the comprehensive test ban treaty disrupt the excellent bilateral relationship that we have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the fourth of this month, I launched the major Australia-India New Horizons promotion that will take place in India in October and November this year. It is a program which will include expenditure by the Commonwealth government of about $6 million across several departments and also support from quite a number of businesses and some state governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New Horizons will lead the government's initiative for 1997, which will be known as the Year of South Asia. It is a very substantial undertaking that demonstrates the importance the government attaches to building our bilateral relations with India, particularly in the fields of trade and investment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to add that the government also accords a very high priority to working with India on a range of regional issues. We welcomed India becoming a dialogue partner of ASEAN, and we strongly supported, after we came to government, India's recent membership to the ASEAN regional forum&mdash;support that has been well understood and well appreciated by the Indian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia and India are also working closely together to promote greater cooperation in the Indian Ocean region. During the course of this week, a meeting of officials is being held in Mauritius. At that meeting, Australia and India, together with our other Indian Ocean regional partners, are exploring proposals for an Indian Ocean regional economic association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the overall point I want to make in answer to the member's question is that Australia is according a very high priority to upgrading our relationship with India. I think that is very timely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">India has a population of over 900 million people. It is a country which has gone through a substantial economic transformation over the last five or so years. That economic transformation is leading to much higher rates of domestic growth in India and the opening of its markets to investment, including investment from Australian businesses. The comprehensive test ban treaty issues apart, we are finding India to be an increasingly valuable partner in regional institutions.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Indeed, it is an appropriate question to have because at lunchtime today here in Glebe Park, Canberra, one of the final welcome home parades for our triumphant paralympians was held. The paralympians were spoken to by me, and I was able to congratulate them on behalf of the government but, more particularly, on behalf of the whole parliament, because I felt sure the whole parliament would want to extend congratulations to the wonderful efforts of the elite athletes with disabilities who performed so well in Atlanta.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member asked for specific details about the level of performance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian medallists set 18 world records and six Paralympic records.

We also saw gold medals in basketball and judo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were many wonderful performances but two athletes in particular were outstanding in world terms and certainly far surpassed anything that Australian athletes have ever done before. Louise Sauvage won gold medals in the 400, 800, 1,500 and 5,000 metre wheelchair track events, and Priya Cooper won gold in the 100 freestyle, the 400 freestyle, the 100 backstroke, the 200 individual medley, silver in the 50 metres freestyle and bronze in the 100 metre butterfly.

The bulk purchasing agreement is going to enable schools across the nation to buy computers, Internet modems and other technology hardware at significantly discounted prices. It is estimated that schools will save up to 30 per cent on each purchase, and the cheaper prices are also going to be available to higher education institutions, to training and vocational education institutions as well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The federal government is committed to ensuring that Australia's school students and apprentices have every opportunity to capitalise on the technology revolution. This is going to be of particular benefit to students in regional Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of the concerns of Australian medical students about the budgetary announcement that Medicare provider numbers will in future be issued only to recognised general practitioners, specialists and those in supervised training? Could the minister please advise the House of the benefits to the Australian health care system of this decision, and outline the career prospects for medical graduates under this new system?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware that there is genuine concern amongst medical students at the change, and that is understandable. There are two very substantial benefits to this change. The first is that it will increase the standing of general practice by not allowing it to be an area that just receives people who do not want to go anywhere else. It will increase the quality of general practice. The second thing it will do is it will help constrain the unrestrained growth of Medicare, which is essential for its long&hyphen;term viability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of career prospects for medical students that the member raises, I make the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4178"> following comments. The work of the Australian Medical Council is successful, it is bearing fruit, and we are finding that specialist positions are expanding. There may be up to 600 places next year for specialists, so there will be greater opportunity there than there has been in the past. Secondly, the number of general practice places will be 400, and we are having discussions with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to make sure that that training is sufficiently flexible to take into account the needs of women or people who want to have part&hyphen;time or interrupted training. Thirdly, a good number of medical students today do not choose to practise clinical medicine on graduation; they may go into academia or administration and will not have a need for a provider number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, the number of doctors that may miss out, so to speak, will depend on two things: the number of overseas&hyphen;trained doctors coming to Australia and medical student intakes. I am very optimistic that this measure will reduce the number of overseas&hyphen;trained doctors seeking to come to Australia, something that successive governments have been trying to do for a very long time but have been very unsuccessful about. But I am also optimistic that we might be able to get a reduction in 1997 in medical student intakes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that together I think will mean that career prospects are actually very good and far better than many students fear. For the honourable member's information, I am meeting with representatives of medical students and resident trainees from all around Australia next week, and if there are any implementation concerns we will do our best to meet them.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I thank the honourable member for his question. For those of us who have been here for some years and have witnessed at first hand Labor's economic record and the failings of their record, to have them lecturing us by way of a question on unemployment is absolutely incredible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During question time we have had a number of questions from the opposition about the impact of our workplace relations bill. The reality is that not only are they opposing measures designed to fix the problems that they created but they are also opposing certain provisions that go to the existence or otherwise of junior wage rates. They feign concern about the young unemployed in this country, but the truth is that within the existing Brereton law sitting there like a time bomb waiting to go off is a proposal to abolish junior wage rates, which on the estimates of the Retail Council of Australia could cost of the order of 200,000 jobs for young people out of a total of 285,000 jobs.

The House should be aware that, of the five similar circumstances where elections have been declared null and void, the Speaker has issued a writ on four occasions. In the fifth instance, involving Mr Cleary in 1992, the by&hyphen;election would have been subsequent to the resignation from the House of Mr Hawke. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> A writ was not issued in the light of an impending general election, although the Speaker's authority to act after the High Court's decision was not called into question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members should be aware that section 33 of the constitution provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whenever a vacancy happens in the House of Representatives, the Speaker shall issue his writ for the election of a new member, or if there is no Speaker or if he is absent from the Commonwealth the Governor&hyphen;General in Council may issue the writ.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Speaker is currently absent from the Commonwealth on parliamentary business, the Governor&hyphen;General in Council may, of course, issue a writ in the present case. However, I repeat that the larger issue is whether the Speaker, if present, would be empowered to issue the writ, as occurred in the past. Moreover, without in any way reflecting on the office of Governor&hyphen;General, I believe that the process normally followed in respect of such elections has been appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members would be aware that the Speaker, having ascertained from the Electoral Office dates which might be considered, has consulted with the party leaders and Independent members before making a decision. The treatment of the issue is clearly as a parliamentary matter. For the Governor&hyphen;General in Council to issue the writ, the decision would be one made by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have requested that the situation be investigated as a matter or urgency. I will, of course, keep the House informed of future developments in the matter as I become aware of them.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a question for you, Mr Acting Speaker. My question follows the intervention you made during the question being asked by the member for Batman.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I suggest, Mr Acting Speaker&mdash;I would appreciate your guidance in due course&mdash;that standing order 59 cannot apply in respect of the asking of a question. What <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4182"> is intended, I believe&mdash;I would ask your advice in respect of this matter&mdash;is that questions are asked through you but be directed to the Prime Minister or some other minister.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the answer is not given to the member asking the question alone but, rather, to the House. So the answer is given through you to the House. Standing order 59 would thereby apply. But it seems to me that there is a very different character in relation to the asking of a question which would unduly constrain and make artificial the way in which questions would be asked were your ruling to be followed in the future.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very interesting thing happened last weekend. Last weekend we saw a sea change in the government's presentation of its case on the issue of unemployment. This totally poll&hyphen;driven government suddenly came to the conclusion that&mdash;whilst they felt very satisfied with their budget reception out there&mdash;growing, swelling in the community was an understanding and a concern about one thing: whatever they had to say in their budget about all the conceivable public policy issues that interest the average Australian, there was nothing&mdash;nothing except a completely bleak outlook&mdash;on the question of employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They came to realise what every person in the public knows: you cannot talk about families, you cannot talk about young people and you cannot talk about the needs of people in or out of the work force unless you have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> one thing at the very centre of your policies. There is no substitute for a job&mdash;not any social security payment, not any charitable institution&mdash;in keeping people's families together, in keeping people satisfied with themselves and their circumstances, in keeping for people the opportunity of a decent retirement. That, after six months in office, suddenly struck them like a silver bullet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did we have immediately after that? We had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on every conceivable airwave over the weekend selling a piece of snake oil economic claptrap that, somehow or other, his policies of sacking people, his policies of depriving people of wages, which he says he is not doing, his policies of destroying people's opportunity in the labour market and his policies of destroying people's capacity to get special assistance to get themselves back into the labour market after being long-term unemployed were all amounting to a strategy that would improve our position on employment as time went by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In question time today the Prime Minister was saying, `Don't blame us for any circumstances in which we find ourselves. We have only been in office for six months.' Indeed you have only been in office for six months. What have we seen since then? From day one, with your stupid propaganda against us, confidence in the business community and amongst consumers has been plummeting. Every measure of consumer confidence and business confidence has been plummeting during that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Australians out there contemplated the fact that our very small Public Service was being made even smaller, as they looked at all the forms of assistance which have ensured that we have had a decent performance from the manufacturing industry over the last 13 years&mdash;as all of that was threatened with being carved away&mdash;and as they watched all the labour market programs, which go to levering people into decent jobs in our community, go out the window, what Australian employers did, be they state, federal or local employers in small or large businesses, was haul in their expectations and haul in their decisions to employ new people, batten down <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4186"> their hatches, go into their bunkers and knock off jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was a position of continuing improvement and job growth became a position of despair for so many Australians. The unemployment figures released today are a direct product of what you have been doing over the course of the last six months. There is no escaping them. Better than that, you know there is no escaping them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We no longer see Senator Vanstone and the minister who will follow me in this debate, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), as they were in the first six months of the year out there saying, `Don't worry about unemployment targets. Don't worry about employment. Challenge the figures because the Bureau of Statistics does not really measure these things properly. Let's set up something at NILS and get a bit of advice on how we ought to be looking at unemployment. Forget about these statistics. Forget about the measures, even though the measures are universally approved as the appropriate way to measure unemployment. No, we do not think we will be able to get unemployment below eight per cent before the end of the century because of these huge problems that are upon us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the rhetoric of the last six months. That rhetoric, which is so in keeping with the intentions in this budget, went out the window last weekend and what we got was snake oil, economic claptrap. It has been exposed by some of those sent out there to produce the earlier statistics. How extraordinary it was to pick up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and see a report from Professor Wootten who did one of those studies to supposedly come up with a proposition that we ought to take no account of the way in which things have been measured in the past and we have to have a new scenario in relation to what employment opportunities&mdash;I will not say `employment targets'&mdash;might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Wootten had a specific question put to him which was along the lines of the one put to the Prime Minister today who claimed so much about his industrial relations policies. What did he say? He said that over the next four years he did not think the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> measures would `do anything for unemployment'. For the rest of this century it will not do anything for unemployment. This is one of the government's advocates when in opposition in years past and one of the government's researchers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been trying desperately over the last six months to get out of the minister's department advice that all the targets that we put up were unachievable, that we should have no targets at all and that really we can live with eight or 10 per cent unemployment. They have not been able to get that out of that department so they went to NILS to get it out of them. What did they get out of NILS? They got a torpedo amidships straight into the heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Wootten could be forgiven for going off the theme in that particular context because I bet he had not been advised of the change of lines after the polls over the weekend. They forgot to ring Professor Wootten. They rang round all their spokesmen. They rang Senator Vanstone. She appeared on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last night. She said, `Forget all the things I have been saying about unemployment, Kerry. We should be able to get unemployment down. If we do not get unemployment down we might not get elected at the next election. Gee, what a thought.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Poor old Professor Wootten was left hanging out to dry on the previous advice that came forward from the government. He did say that perhaps some time into the distant reaches of the next century we might see things coming out of these industrial relations policies that might actually produce a few jobs. He said that we should not think about anything over the next four years. That is the most comfort you can get from your own advisers in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are already accountable for the last six months. You are already accountable for these figures. What do we see in the budget? If you do not want to be accountable for these particular figures this month take a look at your budget figures. When we were in office we achieved growth in jobs at the rate of about 200,000&hyphen;plus a year for the last four years. What do you say in this budget? You say that we are going to get 125,000 jobs this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4187"> year. We might by the fourth year, thank you very much, begin to approach in terms of job creation the levels that the Labor government did at a canter over the previous four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your position as far as unemployment is concerned was completely exposed in the budget. If we put in place your industrial relations policies, put in place your budget cuts, put in place measures to sack bucket loads of public servants and put in place your labour market programs, what we will get out of the hat is the rabbit of a rate of growth about half a per cent to one per cent less per annum than was achieved by us. When you pull out that rabbit and put it back you then pull out its twin. The twin has jobs on it. What does the twin say, `This is a rabbit that is about two-thirds the size at best of the previous one that has been operating so effectively in creating jobs over the last four years.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this government is that it has spent 13 years on employment, frozen in aspic. An extraordinary task was imposed on us during our 13 years in office. We absorbed, by creating employment and catering for changes to our institutions and to our labour market programs, an extraordinary sea change in the structure of the Australian labour market. That extraordinary sea change was the admission of women&mdash;the majority of women now; it was not the case before&mdash;into the work force. That is what we presided over: an extraordinary sea change in the life of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite are frozen in aspic because they remain hostile to those women. They do not talk about choice. Let us keep talking about choice. There is no choice in what they are proposing. That is rhetoric. The reality is there is an attack on the capacity of women to stay working. We presided over that sea change. Our job growth was absorbed by that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister was up today talking about participation rates. He might well talk about participation rates but, if we had had <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the puny participation rates that he presided over when he was Treasurer, do you know what the maximum figure on unemployment would have been during the 1991 recession? Seven per cent. Do you know what the figure would be now? We would be having an argument with you now, with the last set of figures, about the growth in unemployment from 3&half; per cent to four per cent. That is what we would be talking about to you now had it not been for the fact that we had to deal with that massive surge in the participation rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You had a puny task; we had a massive task. But let me tell you: you now live with the consequences of that. You have now got to deal with the fact that we have a completely changed basis to our labour market position. But you have got a plus: over the next decade the rate of growth of the Australian labour market, operating at about 2.2 per cent regularly while we were in office, is going to fall to one per cent. We absorbed that enormous increase in our participation rates. Therefore, the task over the next five or six years compared with the task that we confronted is a bagatelle. And, confronting that bagatelle, what do you do? In your own anticipation, you leave unemployment operating at eight per cent to 8&half; per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you will have to understand, because you will see some truly shocking rates for the long-term employed over the next few years, is that one of the other things we had to deal with was the technological change right through the industrialised world that produced a totally new pattern of long-term unemployment. The labour market programs which we put in place&mdash;those which you have now dismantled&mdash;targeted individual needs in the individual communities in which they operated whilst addressing points of entry into the labour market. It was not based on some broad, general theory; it was what they needed. It is no accident that we were generally regarded in the industrialised world as the most successful devisers of labour market programs. The Working Nation paper, produced by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) when he was employment minister, was regarded as being exemplary.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But I do not think that the Leader of the Opposition needs to worry too much, because the member for Hotham and Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) could never get any numbers right in government. He certainly does not show much quality in getting the numbers right in opposition. He missed out on the deputy leadership. Whenever he sets a target for himself&mdash;whether it be a target in the party room, or a target in the economy with unemployment or a target within his Working Nation program&mdash;he never reaches it. That must explain why the Leader of the Opposition is still looking reasonably comfortable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at some of these missed targets. We have this most extraordinary hypocrisy being put before the House today that somehow or other the government should take seriously the proposition by the Leader of the Opposition that the government should set targets. What was the record of the opposition when it was in government in achieving targets?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look through Working Nation, and we are fortunate to have an evaluation of it, we can see what happened to some of those targets. One of the targets was to reduce the number of people unemployed for 18 months, those in the job compact, by 47 per cent. Despite all the redefinition of the long-term unemployed into the short-term unemployed, the former minister did not even come close to achieving that target. His target was to increase job referrals for the long-term unemployed so as to help them. The fact is that job referrals for the long-term unemployed actually fell by eight per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party in government said that it would increase the number of subsidised jobs for unemployed people to 190,000, yet it managed to get only 54 per cent of that target. It said that it would lift the number of women in labour market programs, but women's share of labour market programs actually fell by two per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that anyone can set shonky targets. But targets do not create jobs; policies which address the fundamentals of the economy create jobs. There was never any chance of Labor achieving the five per cent target. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The Manager of Opposition Business in the House has the nerve to get up and say, `Go on, government; set a target. It will create hope.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He kept talking about the five per cent target. Look how much hope it gave the Australian people. It gave them so much hope that they swept the former government out on a tide of outrage over the failure to put in place policies that had any credibility whatever. The former government had absolutely no chance of achieving that target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Manager of Opposition Business in the House referred to a briefing document from the department of education. He told the House that it supposedly says the Labor Party, when it was in power, was on track to achieving five per cent. Nobody reading that document could possibly believe that is what it said. It made no prediction or statement whatever about the state of the labour market in the year 2000. There was no possibility of that target ever being realised and the Australian people knew that. Setting that target did not help the former government. This government is not going to get into the business of setting misleading targets before the people, because it is concerned to emphasise the substance of policies that will actually create real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come to the Leader of the Opposition, this man who in grand hypocrisy stands up before this House and says, `You should do what I actually said in government we weren't going to do.' On 30 June 1993, in a speech to the National Press Club, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our commitment, as a government and as a nation, should not be to any arbitrary unemployment number or rate; our commitment must be to the reduction of unemployment as rapidly and as completely as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not an unreasonable statement. He failed completely to put into place the policies that would produce that reduction in unemployment. Unemployment did not come down; unemployment stalled. The fact is that the slowdown in the labour market which is still here as a legacy of the previous government began after April 1995. From April 1995 the whole trend of employment growth began to falter. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4190">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the previous year before that, Paul Keating was pumping money into the economy. He was having one of his last big spending binges, a spending binge that the weak Leader of the Opposition failed to prevent. The Leader of the Opposition was the then Minister for Finance. He could have done something. He probably had private thoughts about what he was going to achieve in the Expenditure Review Committee and how he was going to rein in government spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened? Paul Keating, the then Prime Minister, just rode right over the top of him and we had another of these big spending budgets. As government spending was pumping up the economy, inevitably on a short-term basis, growth in the year up to April 1995 was 4.6 per cent. In the following 12 months growth was much weaker at 1.2 per cent, because the fundamentals that were necessary to sustain growth and to provide Australians with real job opportunities had not been set in place. So the Leader of the Opposition rejected targets in government and now has the nerve and arrogance to come before this House and say, `We weren't prepared to accept those targets. I never believed in targets; but you should set targets.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Australian people know better. They saw right through the Labor Party when they put themselves up before the election, targets and all&mdash;the targets of the member for Hotham but not, as we see, targets that have any credibility with the present Leader of the Opposition. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition says things now that he was never prepared to say in government. In government he was one of the more reasonable members; he had some reasonable things to say. He told the head of Telstra that he probably supported the full privatisation of Telstra but now, apparently, they do not even support one&hyphen;third privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition said he did not believe in targets but now he says he does believe in targets. The opposition said that we should bring the budget back into balance over three years. Now they say, `We don't believe that is the case any more.' There are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people&mdash;probably the member for Hotham&mdash;pushing him on saying, `Be more aggressive, Kim. Say a few things that will put them on the back foot.' Put us on the back foot indeed!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has never looked so strong; it has never had so much support from the people. It has never had so much support from the business community&mdash;the people who are going to have to create those jobs&mdash;as it has today. The fact is that the opposition has put in a pathetic performance over the two weeks of parliament since the budget. The shadow Treasurer is absolutely fading out at the moment.

Let me just tell the opposition some of the fundamentals they have failed to address. Australia needs savings. What did the opposition do when it was in government? It piled up deficits totalling around $60 billion over five years when the country needed savings. Those deficits were the deficits that the opposition leader as Minister for Finance was too weak to be able to prevent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If jobs are going to be provided, the fact is that they are going to be provided mainly by small business. What did the Labor Party do? It loaded small business with the unfair dismissals law that made small businesses around this country unwilling to hire full&hyphen;time staff. The Leader of the Opposition is living in a dream world. It is almost hallucinatory to hear his talk about job creation under the Labor Party. In the six years from July 1990 to the election how many additional full&hyphen;time jobs did the Labor Party create? There were an additional 7,100 full&hyphen;time jobs across the whole six years, with unemployment running from a million to about 800,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With only 7,100 full&hyphen;time jobs it is no wonder this country has an unemployment problem. It is no wonder that today we are seeing such figures. There are two aspects to today's figures that are worth giving some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4191"> attention to, because the Leader of the Opposition even misrepresented those today. The fact is that there was a growth in employment in these figures and the figures also showed that many people who had been discouraged were flooding back into the labour market in the hope of finding jobs, precisely because they believe this government has a credible approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tragically, at the moment, those jobs are not there because the Labor Party is holding up in the Senate the government's job creating labour market programs. Until the Labor Party is prepared to pass those programs and until Australia is allowed to get the full benefit of the policies that we have put in place&mdash;the fair and responsible policies that were brought down in the budget and the fair and responsible policies in the workplace relations legislation&mdash;those jobs are not going to come through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party never realised that if young people are going to get jobs they have to be literate and numerate, and they have to get training which leads them to real jobs. At the end of the opposition's term in office, between 10 and 20 per cent of young Australians coming out of primary school did not have adequate literacy or numeracy skills. That was something employers would tell them every time they visited any business&mdash;if they ever visited the businesses which were supposed to employ young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite spent hundreds of millions of dollars churning young Australians through unemployment programs that did not lead on to real jobs. It is up to this government to solve the problems. We didn't create those problems, but we are going to fix those problems by getting back Australian savings and by bringing the budget into balance. We are going to address the problems of escalating debt that were left by the Labor Party to this country. We have increased spending on young people in crucial literacy and numeracy programs and put into place programs that will give real jobs.

But, worse than that, there are 35,000 more unemployed Australians today than there were last month. That is why I consider that if you have any determination in life you ought to be prepared to establish a target and to measure your performance by such a target. That is what life is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone): the major issue confronting the Australian community at the moment is the question of unemployment. The problem is that the Howard government does not regard the question of unemployment as a core issue&mdash;despite the fact that during the election campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went around Australia trumpeting his concern about the issue of unemployment. I refer to the fact that the then Leader of the Opposition, the now Prime Minister, gave 80 speeches during that election campaign&mdash;80 speeches, interviews of one kind or another, press statements, et cetera. In more than 50 per cent of those statements and speeches, the Prime Minister tried to lead the Australian public to believe that he was concerned about the issue of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where are we one&hyphen;sixth of the way through the term of this Howard government? We are in a situation where 36,000 more Australians are unemployed as a result of the performance of this government. I can understand why the Prime Minister does not regard Senator Vanstone in a very popular light today. The Prime Minister is concerned that Senator Vanstone correctly said last evening on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> that there is one issue and one issue alone that the Australian community is concerned with: the question of unemployment. I will tell you why. The Prime Minister should have listened to that respected economist Dr Chris Caton when he said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 19 June this year:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4192">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployment, rather than a lower budget or current account deficit was the number one economic problem facing the federal government and that the deficit disease has been overly diagnosed.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Caton was correct. It is about time ministers such as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) faced up to the fact that, in representing the people he now looks after&mdash;people such as my father, people who were children of the Depression who regarded the postwar reconstruction of Australia and the question of making available decent labour market programs the number one issue then&mdash;he ought to be ensuring that their children and grandchildren are given the same opportunities that Ben Chifley gave the people that he now represents&mdash;the children of the Depression who went away to fight in the Second World War.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real problem is that the Howard government are seeking to ensure that the Costello con, on the basis on which the budget is based, is perpetrated throughout the Australian economy. They like to talk about records. What was John Howard's record when he left office? I know he likes to forget this record. It was a legacy of spiralling underlying inflation of 10.5 per cent, an unemployment rate of 10 per cent and massive industrial turmoil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the former President of the ACTU, I am pleased to say that we faced up to our responsibilities to come to terms with a legacy of inaction and, if anything, we are fighting to accept responsibility for the key issues that confronted Australia prior to 1983&mdash;the issues of unemployment, the issues of inflation and the question of a willingness by working people to sit down and cooperate and work with the business community. Let us consider the record: an inflation rate of 2.5 per cent and the lowest level of industrial disputation in this country since 1940.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite want to talk about the question of jobs. I remind this House that we were prepared to set ourselves targets and seek to achieve those targets by one important ingredient&mdash;sitting down and working with the Australian community. Our approach to government in Australia is that it is one nation. There is an obligation on this government, an obligation on this parliament, to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> work with all sections of the Australian community. That is what the concept of one nation is all about&mdash;irrespective of where you live, irrespective of your background, irrespective of your level of income, irrespective of your gender, irrespective of whether you are an indigenous person or a person of a non-English speaking background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of government is to intervene and assist; the role of government is to go out of its way to ensure that our primary concerns are met. Our primary concern&mdash;unlike what the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), understands at the moment&mdash;is jobs. We established a target in 1993. Not only did we establish a target; the government of the day was given a mandate to implement that target. Our target was to create 500,000 jobs. We were also prepared to risk establishing the target in 1996 of 600,000 jobs. What was the record of government for the period 1993-96? It was in excess of 700,000 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that the first Howard budget is a no jobs budget. The minister for education likes to talk about the importance of small business. I, like the minister, regard small business as being very important for the purposes of job creation in this community. I would also like to remind the minister of what his departmental briefing was on accepting responsibilities. That departmental briefing states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, small business is important.</PARA>
<PARA>But it also says in black and white, in no uncertain terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless large business manufacturing employment also picks up . . .</PARA>
<PARA>You know large business: those business operations that you have taken all industry support away from not only in metropolitan Australia but also in regional Australia in the manufacturing industry and service industry&mdash;the growth industries of Australian employment. It then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the increase in small business manufacturing employment required to achieve 200,000 job targets for the manufacturing industry as a whole would be very substantial.</PARA>
<PARA>Unlike the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), I do not regard labour market pro <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4193"> grams as tiddlywinks jobs programs. I urge the Deputy Prime Minister, the minister for education and the member for Goldstein to get out in Australia, to sit down and talk to people who have benefited from these programs. Go to Ballarat. Go and talk to the clothing worker I spoke to in Ballarat last week at the training Skillshare centre. She was getting a labour market program opportunity then because of the TCF restructuring program that we put in place. The problem is that in the Howard budget that TCF program was knocked off in no uncertain terms at a time of exceptional need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to Victoria&mdash;the minister's home state. In Ballarat, 31 jobs have gone from Oliver and Stevens Footwear; in Bendigo, 54 jobs have gone from Argos Clothing and ADI; in Horsham, 120 jobs have gone from Holeproof; in Thornbury, a town in my electorate, 240 jobs have gone from Clarks Shoes; in Preston, 106 jobs have gone from Windsor shoes. This government suggests that we do not need decent labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister ought to go to Rockhampton and talk to the city council, talk to the local Skillshare centre, talk to the local community, talk to the churches, talk to the Red Cross and talk to the Country Women's Association. All those groups and associations have benefited from Working Nation and I will tell you why&mdash;it is because they put resources into the local community. Those resources have enabled the establishment of the infrastructure that was necessary in the local community, including the Moore Creek restoration program and the heritage village in Rockhampton. They are the types of programs that gave the long-term unemployed a second opportunity in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you what the real problem is today. The Lindsay electorate needs to send this government the message that, one-sixth of the way into the term of its first government, it ought to front up to its responsibilities. It ought to front up to the fact that there is one issue and one issue alone that those electors care about at the moment&mdash;they care about their kids' future, they care about their grandchildren's future and, in some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> instances, they care about their mums' and dads' future. They care about jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government members ought to go out and talk to them. Go to the Mamre's Skillshare centre at St Mary's and sit down and talk to those Sisters of Mercy. Sit down and talk about the benefits of Working Nation. I consider that the coalition policy is a pathway to unemployment. That is what it is&mdash;a pathway to unemployment. There are 35,000 more unemployed this month. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to participate in this debate because it is time people on both sides of this parliament recognised that, so long as there are 850,000 unemployed people out there, all the debate will be about is empty words and empty rhetoric. I am heartily sick of the nonsense dished up by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), who have both suggested that there were 500,000 new jobs created under their government. Even if that were true, I would like the member for Batman to tell me why it is that unemployment under your government and under us for the last five months has continued to rise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamentally, none of us stand here with clean hands. It is all very well for the member for Batman to scurry from the chamber when the direction of the debate no longer suits him. The simple reality is that he has nothing to be proud of. The figures that we are concerned about today are figures that we as the government inherited from the opposition when they were in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no room for passing judgment in this debate. There is no room for people to stand up and say, `Look how well we've done and how poorly you've done.' There is no room for the former government to come in here and suggest that, in some magic way, they set and met a target that solved unemployment. That is nonsense, and the figures today reinforce the fact that that is nonsense. All that the previous government endeavoured to do in its job creation strategy clearly failed. Today's figures are grim testament to the failure of the previous government and its job creation strategy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4194">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the previous government expect us to stand here and apologise, when we have scarcely been in government long enough to get the seat warm, and certainly not long enough to bring into practice the very policies we want to use to address unemployment. On top of that, we are frustrated by another chamber that does not recognise the challenge that we recognised before we came into government and have attempted to address. There is no sense of respectability or responsibility in any of the debate that has come from the opposition benches today on this subject of unemployment.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or humility, as my colleague says. It is inexcusable for anyone, in the face of what is crippling unemployment across this nation, to come in here and say, `This is not our fault; it's yours.' I cannot believe that my colleagues on the opposition benches would be so damnably callous towards the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple reality is that it does not matter whose fault it is. There is a real problem that needs to be addressed, and all of the evidence staring us in the face shows us that the techniques used to address that problem over the last 13 years have failed miserably. The coalition are about doing something about unemployment. We are being frustrated by not having a majority in the second chamber, so the things that we know must happen have not happened. But we are about doing something about it, and the budget handed down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) last month was the first step in addressing the problem of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Treasurer propose? First of all, he proposed to rub out the deficit. Those opposite will say, `Oh, dear me. All you worry about is dollars and the state of the economy, not the state of the unemployed.' If I do not worry about the state of the economy, I create an impossible position for job creation in Australia. So we recognise our first obligation, which is to take a step towards balancing the books so that Australian small businesses and Australian investors&mdash;even overseas investors, dare I suggest&mdash;will say, `This is a nation we want to invest in,' <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and in the process will create some job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman came in and suggested that the minister at the table, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), had said that this was not a core issue. What an affront that must have been to the minister, who has spent his life endeavouring to find ways to get the young unemployed and the long-term unemployed off those queues and into jobs. What the member for Batman needs to realise is that this side of the House is full of people who have had experiences as both employees and employers and know something about what is needed to bring the two together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What members of the opposition never recognise is the problem every employer faces when he or she has job opportunities that need to be filled. Those employers fear filling them because of the possible consequences of a necessary dismissal that will be treated as unfair. I have employers who want to employ people but refuse to put them on because the current unfair dismissal laws discourage them from doing so. We are about doing something about that, but we are being frustrated in the other chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My phone rings almost as frequently with employers with job opportunities as it does with unemployed people seeking work. What does that tell you? It tells you that there are jobs out there waiting to be filled and there are some young people not prepared to fill them. That means that we need to look at the way in which we encourage young people to make themselves available for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much was made by members of the opposition in this debate of what they saw as their proud record and what they saw as the Labor Party's proud record. The name of Ben Chifley was dragged into the debate as if all that was white in employment terms rested with the opposition and all that was black with the government. Statistically that is not right; emotionally that is not right. There is no defence for that sort of jaundiced approach to Australia's employment history. The reality is that the coalition has as much to be proud of in its job creation record&mdash;and I am being generous because, in fact, we have more to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4195"> proud of statistically&mdash;as the opposition. Yet none of that has been recognised in any of the debate that has occurred this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does the opposition genuinely believe that this side of the parliament&mdash;made up, as I said, of employers and employees&mdash;is not aware of the dilemmas that employers face and of the frustrations that employees face? Do you think that we are not aware of part of the solution which, in a society such as ours in which manual work is disappearing, means that we need to apply some imagination to find new job opportunities? We are about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise that new job opportunities will be created when we encourage more job-sharing. We recognise that there is no shortage of Australians with two-income families where both partners, for example, are over 50 years of age and saying, `We would be very happy with an income and a half instead of two incomes. We would be very happy to create another opportunity for another Australian to be employed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could do so if the more flexible industrial relations policies of the Liberal and National parties applied. But, oh no, we must not tamper with industrial relations policy; we must not introduce more flexibility that would allow that sort of job-sharing and create more job opportunities. If anyone should stand condemned for today's unemployment figures, it is those who were so recently on this side of the House, those who had the opportunity to do the very things we would have  encouraged, but they refused to bite the bullet. Here we stand, prepared to have a more flexible labour market, prepared to encourage employers to take on employees; and here we stand, frustrated by the actions of the ALP in the other chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Much was made of labour market programs and of what was alleged to be the failure of the new government to deliver effective labour market programs. In common with a range of people in this parliament, I have had a good deal to do with labour market programs and new work opportunity schemes. I can tell you they were great for the former government, running into the last election, to temporarily reduce unemployment figures and so talk up the state of affairs for them. But in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> terms of creating any full-time jobs&mdash;not a chance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not about mickey mouse schemes, not about new work programs that I encouraged in my electorate because it made me look good; we are about full-time job opportunities as a result of labour market programs that mirror apprenticeships. We have nothing to apologise for. We stand for real jobs; we stand for reducing the unemployment queues; and we stand for giving unemployed young people and the long-term unemployed a new opportunity.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill introduces many initiatives affecting the social security portfolio that were announced either as part of the government's 1996 election commitments or as part of the 1996 budget. The government made election commitments to carers. It is now proposed to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4196"> give effect to these commitments by changing the name of the carer pension to the carer payment and by extending from 10 to 20 hours per week the number of hours that carers may spend in employment, voluntary work, education or training without affecting their qualification for carer payment. There will also be an increase in the number of days in a calendar year, from 42 to 52 days a year, that a carer may temporarily cease caring without affecting their qualification for carer payment. These initiatives will commence on 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, youth training and sickness allowees receive a rate of $65.75 a fortnight, even if their parents' income and assets would have otherwise either resulted in a lower rate or precluded them from payment. The bill provides for the abolition from 1 January 1997 of this minimum payment for customers aged under 18. The parental income test will then be applied to determine the actual rate of payment. This will ensure that there is a more consistent payment structure for youth, as there is no such minimum for Austudy recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Social Security Act 1991 and the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 will be amended from 20 September 1997 to consolidate and simplify voluntary work provisions in those acts. A person aged 50 and over, who is not subject to an activity agreement, will be able to satisfy the newstart allowance activity test by undertaking approved full&hyphen;time unpaid voluntary work for an approved organisation for an unlimited number of days per year for at least 32 hours in a fortnightly period or by a combination of unpaid voluntary work with an approved organisation and suitable paid work for at least 40 hours in a fortnightly period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly a person aged under 50 who is not subject to an activity agreement and who has received income support for at least three months will be able to satisfy the activity test by undertaking full&hyphen;time voluntary work with an approved organisation for six fortnights in their first 12 months of income support. A person will still be required to be available and willing to undertake suitable paid work.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the government made an election commitment to improve and tighten administration of the activity test for unemployment payments. This commitment was made in response to community concerns that only those people who are genuinely unemployed and actively seeking to participate in the work force should receive payment. The measures contained in this bill seek, as part of a wider package of initiatives, to increase community support for assistance to the unemployed by enhancing the integrity of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures will tighten the definition of `unsuitable paid work' for job seekers, change the non&hyphen;payment period for activity test breaches, replace the current deferment period arrangements for administrative breaches with rate reduction provisions, tighten activity test breach provisions relating to voluntary unemployment and refusal of a job offer, reclassify certain breaches as activity test breaches, extend the non&hyphen;payment period for moving to an area of lower employment prospects from 12 to 26 weeks and clarify the operation of the employer contact certificate provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, amendments are included in the bill to change the industrial action provisions in the Social Security Act and the Student and Youth Assistance Act to ensure that where a person is unemployed as a result of industrial action the person will remain disqualified for payment for six weeks after the industrial action has ceased.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures relating to the unemployed will commence on 1 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the bill also contains two discrete measures dealing with waiting periods to be implemented from 20 September 1997. First, the unused annual leave waiting period will be abolished and replaced with an income maintenance period. The new income maintenance period rules will ensure that leave payments are treated as income from the date of payment over a period equal to that for which the leave refers and apply to newstart, sickness, partner, widow and parenting allowances. Secondly, the maximum length of the liquid assets test waiting period, which applies to claimants of newstart allowance, youth training allowance and sickness <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4197"> allowance, will be extended to 13 weeks and will be variable depending upon the person's available funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the bill gives effect, from 20 March 1997, to a number of measures relating to people who are sick and who claim, or are receiving, certain social security payments.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 14&hyphen;day grace period will be introduced so as to allow a person to renew qualification for sickness allowance, or to renew exemption from the newstart or youth training allowance activity tests, through providing the necessary medical certificate after the expiry of the person's previous medical certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sickness allowance qualification rules will be amended by removing the loss of income qualification. Also to be amended are the sickness allowance qualification rules and newstart allowance and youth training allowance activity test exemption rules so that the sole criterion for the continuation of sickness allowance, or exemption from the newstart or youth training allowance activity test, will be a continuing temporary incapacity for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, backdating of disability support pension, newstart allowance, sickness allowance and youth training allowance will be permitted through the deemed earlier date of lodgment of a claim in circumstances where a sick or disabled person makes a telephone inquiry about claiming payment and then lodges a claim formally and qualifies for payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Due to its conceptual and procedural complexity, the earnings credit scheme is difficult to administer and is also difficult for social security recipients to understand. The limited understanding of the scheme by social security recipients puts in doubt its value as a significant incentive to take up casual work opportunities. Given this, as well as the relatively high costs involved in the administration of the scheme, the government has decided to abolish the earnings credit scheme in respect of both pensions and benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the bill introduces amendments to abolish the earnings credit scheme from 20 March 1997. The government has also decided to abolish the employment entry payment from 20 March 1997 and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education entry payment for all but certain pensioners from that date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provisions for assistance to widows and partners were reviewed in the 1996 budget context in response to the need to develop a more rational and integrated social security system, simplify the payment structure and improve services to customers. As a result, the bill gives effect to a number of measures designed to provide common payment conditions for older women without recent work force experience who either are a dependent partner or who lose the support of a partner later in life, as well as ensuring common payment arrangements when customers attain age pension age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, qualification for widow allowance will be extended to women who are aged at least 50 years of age and who were widowed, divorced or separated after turning 40 years of age. Secondly, conditions of payment of widow allowance and partner allowance will be aligned, including common phase&hyphen;out arrangements, a common definition of recent work force experience and common access to ancillary payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, qualification for partner allowance will be extended to Austudy, Abstudy and student financial supplement scheme partners. Fourthly, there will be an earlier phase&hyphen;out of widow B pension such that there will be no new entrants to this payment and by automatically transferring widow B pensioners of age pension age to age pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, arrangements for customers of age pension age will be rationalised by no longer granting widow allowance and partner allowance to people of age pension age and by automatically transferring widow, partner and mature age allowance recipients attaining age pension age to age pension. These measures are to be implemented from 20 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the bill provides for the assessment processes for disability support pension to be tightened to ensure that those people whose impairments have only a relatively small impact on their overall ability to work will not qualify for that pension. Rather, they will receive a more appropriate income support payment. To assist in this process, revised impairment tables, which are used to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4198"> assess whether a person's impairment is 20 per cent or more, are being introduced from 1 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government decided in the 1996 budget to limit payment of child disability allowance arrears to a period of up to three months where a person has made an earlier claim for a payment similar to child disability allowance and was qualified to receive child disability allowance at the time of this earlier claim. Currently, child disability allowance arrears of up to 12 months may be paid in such circumstances. The bill gives effect to that decision from 1 January 1997 and will result in child disability allowance being treated consistently with other social security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the bill provides for the amendment of the compensation recovery provisions of the Social Security Act so as to include age pension as a compensation affected payment. The proposal will only apply to age pensioners who receive compensation for economic loss. Age pensioners who receive compensation for non&hyphen;economic loss only will not be affected. The proposal will only affect an age pension if the compensation is received on or after 20 March 1997 and the person's provisional commencement date for age pension is on or after 20 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The compensation recovery provisions of both the Social Security Act and the Student and Youth Assistance Act will also be amended from 20 March 1997 to enhance the treatment of lump sum compensation payments by using a single pension cut&hyphen;out point as the compensation lump sum preclusion period divisor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For compensation lump sum payments received on or after 20 March 1997, the divisor used to calculate preclusion periods will be changed from the all persons average weekly earnings to the amount above which no pension is payable to a single person under the income test, currently $397 a week. Further, the preclusion period will be applied to the compensation recipient only and not to his or her partner. This means that for lump sums received on or after 20 March 1997, recovery of past payments to partners will not be made, nor will partners be precluded from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> receiving any future entitlement they may have during their partner's preclusion period. The existing rules will apply in respect of those compensation lump sum payments received before 20 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also includes a number of amendments to the Student and Youth Assistance Act so as to align the compensation provisions of that act with corresponding provisions in the Social Security Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the bill includes a number of amendments that are designed to improve the targeting of non&hyphen;cash assistance to retirees and low income earners, restore equity by preventing cards being given to people otherwise not entitled and simplify card administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The health benefits card will be abolished and health care cards will be issued to sickness allowees. The `savings provisions' that allow people receiving family allowance supplement prior to January 1992 to receive a health care card will be repealed. These people will now have to test their eligibility under the normal four&hyphen;weekly income test. Similarly, the modified income test and savings provisions that allow certain social security pensioners to receive concession cards after cancellation of pension will be repealed. These measures will take effect on 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for the removal of the concessional treatment applied to `deposit concession money', as defined in the Social Security Act and the Student and Youth Assistance Act, from 20 March 1997. As a result, the `below threshold rate' of extended deeming will apply to the first $2,000 of available money or deposit money of a person other than a person who is a member of a `pensioner couple' as defined in the Social Security Act. The `below threshold rate' will also apply in all cases to the first $4,000 of available money or deposit money of a `pensioner couple'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the Social Security Act and the Student and Youth Assistance Act will be amended, from 1 October 1997, to provide for recovery of social security payments that have been paid to persons in excess of their correct entitlement but which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4199"> are not currently recoverable as debts. In addition, where possible, the debt creation provisions will be rationalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recovery of overpayments will occur according to the means of a person to pay. This will improve equity between customers, some of whom are now able to retain more than their correct entitlement even though they have ample capacity to repay, while others with limited finances are obliged to repay their debts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, the bill provides for the modification of the advance payment scheme for recipients of social security entitlements. The modifications include removal of a `permitted purpose' as a qualification requirement for an advance payment, reduction of the maximum advance amount to $500 and restriction of the number of advances payable to a person to one advance in 12 months. This measure will take effect on 1 January 1997.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>The government is pleased to see back in the House the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996 in substantially the same form as was proposed to this House. I believe it is a strong endorsement of the overall approach of the government to allow private capital and innovation to support the provision of essential infrastructure in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the Federal Airports Corporation has done an excellent job both in developing Commonwealth airports to the point where they provide a very healthy level of non&hyphen;aviation revenue supporting the cost of providing airport infrastructure, and in cross&hyphen;subsidising between airports to ensure that each Commonwealth facility has a good standard of passenger facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next stage of developing these airports is to remove the constraints to pricing and investment created by the network cross&hyphen;subsidies and to allow each airport to reflect the aspirations and the economics of its location. I expect that the sales process will now move into high gear and we can expect to see substantial activity from bidders and their consortiums and speculation about favoured parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) has established sale conditions and outlined recently the open and transparent process to be followed. He has also noted that the Australian National Audit Office will be involved in assessing the performance of the process after the event. All expectations of airport owners and requirements of the bidding process will be established clearly in advance of the process commencing. Part of the clarity that we are providing the bidders and airport users is included in the bills under consideration this afternoon.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4209">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has itself put forward some amendments to ensure effective cross&hyphen;ownership restrictions between Sydney and the first phase airports&mdash;a matter which I foreshadowed as possible in my comments when the bills were last before the House. I am pleased that these have been accepted by the Senate. We also gave close consideration to the amendments proposed by the Greens. I note with some pride that the government did not resist many of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, there has been a very helpful and positive exchange between us on environmental matters. The government always intended a strong environmental regulation regime to apply at airports. Indeed, by comparison with the environmental regime on airports which existed under our predecessors, this government has moved light years ahead of the Labor Party. So, in many areas, the Greens' amendments reflected things that we intended to do as a matter of course under the environmental management plan or environment regulations, both of which are to follow from the Airports Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will accept the bill as amended. It is a matter of no little significance that the legislation to reform the investment in and the development of airports in Australia is one of the first pieces of legislation to pass under this government. May this herald a continuing stream of transport reforms from my portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I thank all those people who have contributed to the debate, particularly Senator Tambling, my parliamentary secretary, who handled a great deal of the debate in the Senate on my behalf.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Melbourne)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.56 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is not opposing the amendments to the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996. The bulk of them are amendments that the opposition proposed in the House. They were defeated then but subsequently were agreed to by the government in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make some comments on some of the matters contained in those amendments. Firstly, with respect to the cross&hyphen;ownership rules, we have had the last minute insertion of Perth. That has amused many of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> us. Obviously, it means that the Premier of Western Australia has been asleep or out of touch with what is going on in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premier of Victoria was running around on the question of the cross&hyphen;ownership rules for some time, as were many other people. But, apparently, Richard Court has just woken up to the fact that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is selling his airport and that he had better do something about it. So he got on the phone and said, `Hey, I want some cross&hyphen;ownership protection as well.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That says a considerable amount about Richard Court's awareness of what is going on around him. It also raises the question of how much muscle Dean Brown has. Why isn't Adelaide in there as well? Maybe Tony Rundle should be asked the same question. It also indicates that the state branches and state governments still run the Liberal Party and the coalition and that, if they say jump, the federal government is going to ask how high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also indicates&mdash;I am sure that the minister will be pleased to hear me say this, although he will not admit it&mdash;that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has been an absolute pushover on all of this. Originally, the Treasurer rolled the minister in the cabinet on this question and managed to have no cross&hyphen;ownership rules at all. Then his arch enemy, the Premier of Victoria, got into the act. We indicated that we would be opposing it in the Senate, and the government got a bit worried. So the Treasurer was pushed back to the position that prevailed in the previous legislation that the Labor government put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, as a result of a phone call from Richard Court, the Treasurer has been pushed back even further. The worry is that the total return from the sales to revenue will be diminished accordingly. I am also concerned to make sure that this is not some sort of shonky exercise designed to assist some local mates of Richard Court who have their eyes on the airport and would like to reduce competition for it. I urge the minister to pay very close attention to the sale process of Perth airport as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other comments I would like to make relate to the situation in regional ports. It is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4210"> unfortunate that no emphasis has been placed on ensuring local ownership of regional ports. It is also unfortunate that there is no provision for ensuring full competition with respect to general aviation as between ports, particularly in the major cities. It is possible, for example, to have one owner for all the airports conducting general aviation activities in Sydney and Melbourne, which means that the potential for competition will be minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have a number of concerns on the sale process. Some of those concerns were addressed in a letter to me from the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) in recent times. But I have a number of outstanding concerns, particularly with the pricing regime and various aspects of disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has indicated that he will tell the bidders what the tendering requirements will be but he has not indicated whether anybody else, such as the parliament, will be told. It is incumbent upon the minister to indicate to the parliament precisely what the bidding regime will be, what requirements will be placed on bidders and what information will be required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He should also be telling us what the basis of the pricing regulation is going to be, what the commencement point will be. Will it be the current price? Will it be the intended increased price that the FAC is seeking? Where will the base be for CPI minus X? That is something that we still have not determined. There are a number of other matters that I would like to see clarified. I have recently written to the Minister for Finance on this matter and I would sincerely hope that he responds to my letter as quickly as he did to my first letter. Although the fact that my current letter has not got a run in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> might slow him down a bit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to our overall position relating to cross&hyphen;ownership rules and to the sale. As I have indicated, the opposition does not have a problem with the insertion of the cross-ownership rules and does not oppose the insertion of Perth, although it does ask some questions about the distinction with Perth&mdash;why Perth should be in there while Adelaide is not, and what the reason is for putting it in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the cross&hyphen;ownership provisions at the last moment, as has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This really does raise some questions about the minister's control over the whole process and the extent to which he has been consulting with affected parties. Are we to believe that Richard Court has been completely unaware of these issues&mdash;that he has no idea that the airport is going to be sold and that he has only just discovered that there are some concerns for Perth that he needs to address? Or is it the case that the minister has failed to consult adequately with state governments and other interested parties? I do not know the answer; I would be interested to know it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to the comments by the shadow minister for transport. I thank him for the support he is offering for the passage of the Airports Bill and also for the support in the Senate. He made a couple of points in his remarks, some of which he made clear have been addressed in correspondence he has had with the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey). Of course, it is the Minister for Finance who is now responsible for the asset sales task force which will be handling the actual sale of these airports&mdash;or the long-term lease, to be more correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister raised a couple of points which were also raised in the Senate earlier today by Senator Collins. They go to why Mr Court suddenly showed an interest in this matter. I will recount the history of the matter. A Senate committee, chaired by Senator Winston Crane, held a hearing some time back at which the Western Australians raised the issue of some cross-ownership provisions. We took the opportunity to consider that matter. Consultations had been undertaken with the various state Premiers&mdash;Mr Court in Western Australia, Mr Brown in South Australia and Mr Rundle in Tasmania. Mr Court was interested in having some cross-ownership provisions apply in the bill. Neither Mr Brown nor Mr Rundle felt it was appropriate for their states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have done in this bill is simply try to reflect the interests and concerns of those people who raised the cross-ownership <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4211"> arrangements in the Senate hearings and also to reflect the interests and concerns of those premiers whom the government has consulted. That is the reason for the cross-ownership provisions introduced into the Senate today. Of course, the shadow minister would know that we did introduce cross-ownership provisions for Sydney and Brisbane and Sydney and Melbourne which reflected to a great degree the cross-ownership provisions which the previous government had introduced in the legislation they brought into the parliament. The desire to introduce that reflected the content of the debate that we had here in the House of Representatives the last time we discussed this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is greatly unfair to try to paint Mr Court as not being on the job. I can assure you that Mr Court has been on the job for a considerable amount of time in regard to this issue. He has been following due process and has been properly consulted, and his concerns have been reflected in the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And he no doubt likes little children as well. I want to follow up on the comments of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) with a couple of other matters relating to the amendments. I am taking the liberty to do so as we are dealing with the amendments in globo. With respect to the process of sale, I would be interested in receiving further information on&mdash;I have written to the Minister for Finance about these matters&mdash;who is going to be consulted about the content of regulations governing airport operations. The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) indicated in his letter to me that there would be consultation about this issue, but he did not say who would be consulted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, what guarantees will be given that, once the regulatory regime is established, it will not be subsequently fiddled with to favour the interests of a particular successful bidder or group of bidders? That is something that, as I have indicated elsewhere, is a particular concern given the outrageous things that have happened in the tendering process with the casino in Victoria. In that case we have seen Hudson Conway have a range of subsequent changes made to the regulations <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> governing the operation of the casino to allow it to expand substantially. Of course, these opportunities were not available to the losing bidder at the time that the original tender was called. I am very concerned to ensure that the same sort of thing does not occur with the airport tendering process, particularly given that we have a variety of international interests involved. It would be a disaster for Australia's reputation internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, how will a pricing regime be managed if an airport operator seeks to change the basis of aeronautical charges? It is a bit hard to apply CPI minus X if at some time an operator comes along and says, `We now want to charge per passenger' or per something other than maximum take&hyphen;off weight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter I would like to refer to quickly is the question of environmental issues. It is rather ironic that the minister should make some play of having done rather well with the Greens. Of course, the matters he refers to are also matters that ALP senators supported, with one exception which the government did not support&mdash;and I will refer to that in a minute. It is rather ironic when you consider what is going on with the proposal at Holsworthy, which clearly is environmentally crazy. It is right next to the Woronora dam and is part of the Woronora catchment area. It is adjacent to a national park. There are serious noise problems for people who were assured&mdash;as I indicated in my adjournment speech last night with respect to a sale of land by the Defence Housing Authority&mdash;as late as only a fortnight before the minister indicated that Holsworthy would be looked at as an airport site, that there was not going to be any airport there. There are also deficiencies in the EIS process. So it does not behove the minister all that well to try to parade in green clothing when it comes to airports when we consider what is going on with Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4212"> I think it is also worth noting the delay, which has finally been demonstrated in the budget papers, that the Holsworthy option is causing in finding a solution for the construction of a second airport, which is clearly necessary to solve the problems with Kings ford&hyphen;Smith. The $73 million provided for in our forward estimates in the previous budget has been taken out of this year's budget and not replaced in subsequent forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final comment relates to the amendment that the Greens moved and which had Labor support but which was unsuccessful. I simply clarify that that amendment would have expanded the area of consultation for airport owners and required them to actually make statements in their airport master plans as to how they proposed to deal with noise problems up to the area of 20 ANEF, which is much broader than the 30 ANEF band which was ultimately adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be fair to Senator Tambling, I point out that he correctly stated that this would potentially place excessive pressure on future owners to insulate houses as far afield as the 20 ANEF band. He did not state explicitly that this would cost $1 billion to $2 billion. He did say that if the worst possible outcome occurred and they caved into this pressure that is what would have occurred. This has been reported and interpreted as meaning that the Greens' amendment, which we supported, would have added $1 to $2 billion to the budget deficit. That is entirely untrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All it would simply do is place an onus on airport owners to consult more broadly and to develop strategies for noise amelioration more broadly than the outcome has imposed upon them. Whether that would have involved the expenditure of money, changes in other arrangements such as flight paths or a decision not to do anything at all would have been entirely a matter for those involved. The suggestion that that proposal would have caused additional expenditure of great magnitude is simply incorrect. I thank the House for the opportunity to refer to these matters. As I indicated, the opposition will not oppose these amendments or the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendments to the Airports Bill. I wish to express some concerns my electorate has about the environmental issues surrounding Kingsford&hyphen;Smith airport. That airport is operating in a very inconvenient, to say the least, mode for residents of my electorate. On 20 March this year the govern <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ment opened the east-west runway without obtaining an environmental impact statement. This has caused great suffering to residents in my area and has had an effect on schools, hospitals and buildings generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government made a promise prior to the federal election to undertake the same noise amelioration program for areas under the east&hyphen;west runway as is being undertaken at the moment for areas under the north&hyphen;south flight path. Regrettably, while that program will shortly commence in a very limited area, funding in this year's budget for noise amelioration work under the east-west flight path has actually been reduced. The question that immediately arises is how adequate that noise amelioration program will be when, in effect, one area is being deprived of funds to supplement another area. It is causing very real and genuine distress. I am constantly receiving phone calls and complaints from school principals and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate that the issue of aircraft noise is an intense political one. I fear that, in relation to the environmental issue, the east-west runway is being used for statistics when during quieter periods of the day planes could take off over water. By way of example, last Saturday and Sunday I had the displeasure of painting the outside of my home. They were still days but even so during the middle of the day numerous planes flew over my area. I believe there is no reason the east-west runway had to be used during that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is significant that in August 1994 a plane crashed into Botany Bay shortly after leaving the southern end of the north&hyphen;south runway. On my reckoning, if that plane had taken off on the east-west runway it would have landed in about Brighton, which is a heavily populated area. In 1990, a plane took off from the east-west runway and swung around in an endeavour to get back on the tarmac, but unfortunately it did not make it and crashed on the north&hyphen;south runway killing all eight people on board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statistics show that the great majority of air accidents occur within eight kilometres of an airport and primarily during take-off. The issue of planes taking off is of great significance. If an accident occurred it would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4213"> be not only a matter of human tragedy but also a matter which I surmise would bring down the government. I ask the government to sincerely look at its policy on Sydney's Kingsford&hyphen;Smith airport. Clearly, this policy of planes using the east-west runway for the sake of proving statistics and saying that it is being utilised is a recipe for disaster. It does not need to occur. Those planes could be taking off over water.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Senate amendment to ensure that the minister does not have the power to exempt a leaseholder from environmental and planning considerations and public consultation for an airport site. I do so after having had my views on this matter fashioned by the government's handling of the Holsworthy airport proposal. Just recently, some 50,000 submissions were made on the draft EIS guidelines for the Sydney second airport. Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, said that this was an attempt by residents to clog up the process. He said this despite a clear government promise to have open consultation, full public involvement, a full environmental assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the Minister for the Environment breaking that commitment, breaking that promise, by saying that some people are trying to clog up the system. You cannot clog up a system whereby people are fighting for their livelihood, where people are fighting for their home values, where people are fighting for their families and their lifestyle. That is what we are talking about with Holsworthy and the south-west of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great bulk of the 50,000 submissions relate to Holsworthy because many people are concerned about the project. Many people have signed petitions. I know the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale) has received them, along with submissions on the guidelines. I have received them. The member for Banks (Mr Melham) and the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) have received them, and even the member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey) would have received some.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government, because of its track record and the comments Senator Hill made on the draft EIS, needs to be watched. I also <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believe that we should not be entrusting the member for Hume, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), with those sorts of exemptions because the documents I have seen lodged by the proponents of the Lawrence Hargrave project identify him personally as their champion within the coalition. Why should the minister, that same person, have the power to exempt this airport proponent, this private consortium, from public consultation once an airport site is established? That is also a very legitimate concern, and I raise it with regard to that second Sydney airport proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have a concern about the process whereby, without any public announcement, apparently without revealing the advice from the Department of Transport and Regional Development, the draft EIS guidelines for the second airport have an increase in the capacity of the proposal from 275,000 aircraft movements per annum to 360,000. Of course, before the election nobody mentioned Holsworthy airport, and the coalition certainly did not mention its plan to increase the capacity for the second airport by 30 per cent. The member for Macarthur, I think the member for Lindsay, who has now gone to meet her maker in a political sense, the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett) and the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) all said, `We'll make the airport smaller. If we can do away with a second Sydney airport, we will.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has gone back on that commitment and has increased the capacity for Sydney's second airport by 30 per cent. People in the seat of Lindsay and all the electorates in the south-west of Sydney should bear that in mind: this is a clear broken promise. If people in Penrith or Holsworthy or along the western or south-western population corridors in Sydney think a vote for the coalition is a vote for a smaller second airport or no second airport at all, they are mistaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that the member for Hume reveals the basis of the advice by which he has decided to increase the capacity from Labor's planned 275,000 aircraft movements per annum&mdash;it was clearly in our draft guidelines in January&mdash;to a whopping 360,000. We have all this after 10 years, even <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4214"> 20 years, of debate about airports in Sydney and when the Department of Transport and Regional Development and the FAC have said we need less capacity at the second airport. Their big plan and all their forecasts have always been geared around the idea of expanding Mascot, because the second airport would be an unrealistic proposition. Such was their advice for many years&mdash;that we need less capacity, not more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So where out of the blue did the member for Hume come up with a 30 per cent increase in capacity? This man, this member, this minister, needs to be watched. I have got my eye on him in every sense. I certainly agree with the Senate amendment that ensures he does not have the power to exempt the project of which he is a champion, the Lawrence Hargrave project, from proper public scrutiny and consultation on those vital environmental and planning issues in the south-west of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting thing is that all the rhetoric the minister has used about where the planes come from and where they go to&mdash;allegedly over the national park&mdash;is word for word in that project's submission. Not only is he their champion; he is their echo.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is true to say that out in my part of the world Badgerys Creek was an issue. I have already stated to the House that I have had a long history of supporting a second airport in Sydney, but I have to say that the climate of people's attitudes in the last 11 years has changed somewhat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to tell the House about a meeting that occurred at Memorial Hall at St Marys in my electorate. I understand Jackie Kelly was invited to go&mdash;I was certainly under the impression she was, although I am now aware this is disputed&mdash;but did not front. The important point is that the Liberal representative, who is now the parliamentary secretary, Senator Bob Woods, gave clear undertakings there would be a go/no go clause in the EIS.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under New South Wales state legislation, if an environmental impact statement is commissioned, at the end of that study a recommendation must be made on balance that the proposal, whatever it is, go ahead or not go ahead. I think this is a good thing. Of course, that decision can be overridden by a minister, and no doubt that minister would explain why they might override such a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that our environmental legislation does not make such a provision, but the important thing honourable members in this chamber need to understand is that during the last election it was promised that Badgerys Creek, and presumably now Holsworthy, would be covered by the same commitment: that there would be a go/no go clause. I regret to inform the House&mdash;it pains me to say this, actually&mdash;that there ain't such a provision. This is a clear indication of deceit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well to say that the minister is going to make the ultimate decision about EISs, and that is true. But when you go to the people particularly out in my electorate&mdash;and it is true to say that there were people from the electorate of Werriwa, from the electorate of Lindsay, from my electorate and from the electorate of Prospect; they were all there at that meeting, as well as locals&mdash;you will find that they were promised a go/no go provision, and it is not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole issue of Sydney West airport&mdash;and we had this problem when we were in government; now the present government has the same problem&mdash;is to try to restore some confidence in the whole process. When you make an undertaking that such a critical provision will be within the framework of the EIS draft guidelines and it is not, you suffer a credibility gap; you actually damage the whole process, and that is what you are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With any new airport in any metropolitan or urban location, the idea that you can have 24-hour operation is just ludicrous. I know the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has pointed out the difference between the standards applying in the United States and the standards that we are applying in Australia to night flights. If I was one of the keenest advocates of an airport at Badgerys Creek, it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4215"> is true to say that I had long given away the aspiration of a 24-hour operation. But I think that is what you will get if Badgerys Creek goes ahead or if Holsworthy goes ahead&mdash;a 24-hour operation. This is going to have a tremendously adverse impact on people wherever such an airport may be located.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I see that my time is running out. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to again remind the House of my interest in this matter. This issue of a go/no go clause in the EIS may be taken up in the Lindsay by-election.

We may have got a long way towards resolving some of the problems of Sydney airport if the current government had allowed the previous government's legislation on the sale of Sydney airport to go through. The worry I have with the way the present government is conducting the arrangements with Sydney airport and Sydney West airport is that we could end up with the worst of all worlds: no decision being able to be made on Sydney West airport, so Sydney airport becoming the only airport for Sydney. The effect of that would be to turn all of south-western Sydney and part of the eastern suburbs of Sydney into a noise ghetto.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the election we have seen the government's disgraceful policy of so-called spreading the pain. The area of Earlwood is in my electorate. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) grew up there. He will not attend the Earlwood Public School's 80th birthday celebrations because he knows that the people of that area will want to tear him apart. That suburb never had aircraft noise before. That suburb was a quiet corner of Sydney. People who have lived there for 30 or 40 years tell me that they have never experienced aircraft noise. Twenty and 30 planes a day are now flying over their houses. They really think that the Prime Minister&mdash;the local boy made good&mdash;ought not chance his arm by coming back to see them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened in places like Earlwood and other parts of my electorate will be tremendously exacerbated if the government cannot make a decision on where to build Sydney West airport. The only solution to noise problems at Sydney airport is to get on with building another airport that will service Sydney. We have seen in the newspapers in recent days proposals both by airbus industries and the Boeing company to build these massive new 600-seat aircraft. Members can imagine the amount of thrust that would be needed to lift an aircraft with 600 people aboard it. Imagine that noise spreading all over that part of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government ought to get its act together. The government ought to hurry ahead and build Sydney West. The government ought to do away with the disgraceful traffic management arrangement that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has inflicted on the people who live around Sydney airport. Unless the government does that, that part of Sydney where nearly a million people live will turn into a ghetto. In the end, the financial imperatives will mean that the curfew will start to be sliced away. If you turn Sydney airport into a 24-hour operation airport, the lives of those people around there will be disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has done his best to ensure that he gets his way by looking after people in Liberal electorates and inflicting aircraft noise on parts of Sydney that never had this problem before. This is a disgraceful, dishonest attitude that the government has adopted towards the people of my electorate in particular. While I agree with my colleague the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) with the propositions he is putting forward, I also think the government should take on board the dire need to get on with the job of building a second Sydney airport so that we can do something to relieve the traffic at the current Sydney airport.</PARA>

The major one that I want to look at and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4216"> support is the one that stopped the government from exempting private airport owners from scrutiny by the Environment Protection Agency. The amendment that has been accepted by the government ensures that the Environment Protection Agency will have to scrutinise what private owners of airports do with those airports. It means that the consideration of the situation at Holsworthy will still be under the aegis of the Environment Protection Agency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note as well that when the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) was addressing these amendments he indicated that the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), in looking at the arrangements for the long&hyphen;term lease of these airports, had ensured that there would be an open and transparent process in those financial arrangements. I hope we will have an open and fully transparent process when looking at the full environmental impact statement in relation to both Holsworthy and Badgerys Creek. I fear that in the past we have not had a completely open or transparent process when looking at the situation of Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the last election the then opposition did not give any indication whatsoever that they would be looking to put a second airport at Holsworthy. They gave no indication whatsoever that they would be seeking to include Holsworthy in the EIS that was undertaken in relation to Badgerys Creek. Likewise, prior to the last election they gave no indication, except for the action they took in the Senate, that they would stop the fast&hyphen;tracking of Badgerys Creek or that they had anything else on their agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find that in the past they really have not been open or transparent in relation to this matter. It is quite obvious that when they stopped the process of the fast&hyphen;tracking of Badgerys Creek there was something definitely on the agenda. Since the election we have found out that that was the inclusion of Holsworthy as a second site for consideration in the environmental impact statement of Sydney West Airport. This is despite the fact that for 10 years Badgerys Creek had been the place that was chosen, despite the fact that the government had spent more than $155 million <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on buying land for the development of that and despite the fact that the government had committed itself to the fast&hyphen;tracking of Badgerys Creek so it could be open for the Sydney Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now know, after the election, that that is no longer possible&mdash;there will not be a Sydney West Airport open for the Sydney Olympics. We know absolutely that the government's preference is for the second Sydney airport to be at Holsworthy. That has come through very loudly and clearly, time and time again, in their comments&mdash;and the media commentators have picked that up very directly. The impact of not having had an open and transparent process certainly means there has not been enough time to consider the impact on Holsworthy and half a million people in the south&hyphen;west area of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of putting a second airport in at Holsworthy is that now we have an environmental impact statement process that is tremendously foreshortened. On this side of the House we have taken the position that the government should get ahead with Sydney West Airport&mdash;effectively that they should get ahead with building Badgerys Creek airport because that has been 10 years in the making&mdash;and that the long&hyphen;term lease of the airports and the question of Sydney airport need to be resolved as quickly as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment this evening on the unemployment situation in Australia, especially in Tasmania. It is very good that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is at the table. Unemployment took up some of the consideration of the House today in question time and in the matter of public importance. The figures have come out today of the trends in Tasmania, with the trending line going from 10.2 per cent in February to 10.6 per cent in August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have asked the government to give us a target, to lay down a figure&mdash;just as the previous government did&mdash;to give itself a benchmark so that we can make a judgment about it. It is what we are saying should be done in the workplace. We have a benchmark now in the workplace to get world best practice. We are asking the government to set a benchmark. We are saying, `Set a benchmark so that we can make a judgment against <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you.' But the government has failed to do that, and it has failed to do that because it knows that unemployment will continue to increase in Australia. It is going to show that it does not care about unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that unemployment in Tasmania will continue to rise because of this last budget and the government's attitude. There have been cuts in skillshare and in skillshare areas where people who have need of literacy and numeracy skills go. They are not the people who are getting into the TAFE colleges; they are people who have need of skillshare. You have cut 33 per cent out of the budget relating to them. New work opportunities, building skills in people, giving them the opportunity to get work right throughout Tasmania, have gone. As for long-term unemployed people having an opportunity to get back into the work force, you have given them nothing and taken everything away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have failed the test as minister, and your government has failed to set a target for us, to give itself a benchmark so that people can make a judgment about it. You have failed the test, and the government has failed the test. The continuing attacks on regional areas which you have made in this budget have hit my state enormously. Tasmania is very regional, very isolated and, when you take some of the actions that were taken in this budget, they affect it greatly. You have betrayed us as a state, as you have betrayed the other regions of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope not, Mr Acting Speaker. Let me just touch on a couple of points where I can detail how Tasmania has been treated and how unemployment will increase in our state. There are 380 places to be cut from the University of Tasmania. Those people will either join the dole queue or, if they are lucky enough to gain employment, will replace somebody who was going for that job. Thirty places will go out of our maritime college, a major asset in the north and Launceston. According to the last report I saw, I think 33 per cent of the economic basis of that area of Tasmania is related to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4218"> education. So this is a major blow for that region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 30 per cent cut to the Working Nation program will have enormous effects right through northern Tasmania and Tasmania generally. The cuts to road funding will have enormous effects in relation to tourism, as we were trying to increase access to certain smaller subregions in Tasmania. The ships bounty is to be abolished. It was the biggest employer in Tasmania, the main trainer of apprentices, the main trainer in Tasmania and the biggest employer of apprentices. Whack goes the ships bounty and other help that was structured to assist and build skills into that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tamar regional environment study, which highlighted the needs and opportunities associated with that area, became an economic tourist and recreation centre. There were opportunities identified in that report and pushed forward by the regional development body, but with the loss of $150 million out of the regional fund they have nowhere to go. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.42 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to draw to the attention of the House the facts about the Perth airport and the government's position in relation to airport noise. These are in contrast with the inaccurate and misleading comments made about me and the Perth airport by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) in the House last evening. By the way, unlike the member for Perth, I notified him that I would be speaking on this matter this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Perth was factually incorrect&mdash;incorrect when he said that the government had dropped a compensation package for noise affected areas surrounding the Perth airport and incorrect when he said, about compensation, that there is one rule for Sydney and one rule for others. The government has not dropped a compensation package for noise affected areas surrounding the Perth airport because the package did not exist. It may have existed in the fertile mind of the member for Perth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Perth said that there were contracts for a noise audit or a scoping study. Presumably these studies were going to lead to the compensation package that he was talking about. Was there a contract for the compensation package? Was that also on the then minister's desk? Although they were on the desk of the then Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), the writs had been issued for the federal election, which meant that these supposed contracts could not be signed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are expected to believe that these contracts were there all the time. It is a bit like saying that the cheque is in the mail. In other words, it was a pre&hyphen;election pork-barrel; it was a con. The Minister for Transport did not know when the federal election was going to be called, otherwise he would have been better prepared and had the contracts signed. I do not understand how the Minister for Transport, a member of the previous cabinet, did not know when the election was going to be called because almost everybody else in Australia knew when the election was going to be held.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these studies were so urgent, so important, why did the former Labor government not act sooner? The member for Perth has been in government since 1993. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was the former member for Swan. He could have done something about it. What did they do? What did they do in 13 years of government? Nothing but tokenism on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Perth is incorrect in saying that there is one set of rules for Sydney and one for other places. In Sydney, compensation was awarded to people whose residences fell within the 40 ANEF contour band and the 30 ANEF contour band. Even though Senator Margetts also wanted people within the 20 ANEF contour to be compensated, thankfully commonsense has prevailed here. In Perth no residences fall within the 30-plus contour. The 30&hyphen;plus footprints are found over industrial land, 35&hyphen;plus over the airport's buffer zone and 40&hyphen;plus over the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is quite a different situation from Sydney. In Sydney 4,380 residences north of the airport are within the 30 ANEF contour. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4219"> In Sydney 151 residential properties fall within the 40 ANEF contour. As I said, in Perth no residences fall within the 40 or even 30 contour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Perth, Airservices Australia calculate the Australian noise exposure forecast&mdash;the ANEF&mdash;contours for the FAC. That is how we know what the contours or footprints are. Airservices Australia have microphones in place around the areas surrounding the airport, including residential areas, to measure the noise emanating from aircraft. A further acoustic study would only duplicate this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Airservices Australia continually run compliance studies to make sure aircraft are complying with their regulations and restrictions. These address the noise impact of flight paths. The member for Perth, who became so interested in the airport last year&mdash;yes, last year&mdash;leading up to the election, is aware of the monitoring which is done around the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to representing the people of South Guildford. I do not think, as the member for Perth said last night, they are in shock and horror at this prospect, because they already know that I am not going to make wild promises of things that might not be delivered, as the former government did leading up to the election. I am not going to irresponsibly promise things and build up their hopes only to have them dashed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already helped the people of South Guildford, when I made representations about the sewerage problems in their area to the state government and saw Premier Richard Court about it. Sewerage work is now being undertaken in South Guildford, and the people of South Guildford know that that has nothing to do with the member for Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Perth has irresponsibly imposed a cruel hoax on the people of South Guildford by bringing an unnecessary focus on their residences. I hope his actions have not had the result of devaluing their properties by amplifying this perceived problem in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The ALP clearly do not want the problems of the people of South Guildford. Their member obviously no longer wants to repre sent them. I wonder whether the people of South Guildford know that the ALP asked for South Guildford to be removed from the electorate of Perth in their submissions to the Australian Electoral Commission. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Saturday, 17 August, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  carried a feature article by Mike Seccombe on the federal Treasurer (Mr Costello). That article contained the following paragraph:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>On the face of it, the actions of Michael Kroger, a former president of the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party, appear to be a breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Section 326(2) of that act relates to bribery and, for the information of the House, it reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person shall not, in order to influence or affect:</PARA>

<PARA>The penalty for an offence against section 326(2) is $5,000 and/or two years gaol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The article makes it quite clear that Tim Costello was considering running as a Senate candidate for the Australian Democrats. The dinner was organised with a view to influencing his candidature by encouraging him not to run. The claim that jobs were discussed at this dinner brings the events of that evening very much into the realm of section 326 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4220">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very serious matter. Public confidence in our political system should be maintained at all times, and we need to ensure that all Australians know and respect the Commonwealth Electoral Act. There is a special responsibility, I believe, on people involved in politics&mdash;like Michael Kroger&mdash;to ensure that their actions do not undermine public confidence. The language of the act deliberately includes a wide range of actions, because these actions undermine the integrity of our political system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect, Michael Kroger is no different from anyone else concerning the law. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article suggests very strongly that Mr Michael Kroger may have broken the law, and I call upon the Australian Electoral Commission to immediately launch an inquiry into this matter.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 September the Chief Justice of the High Court ordered that a by-election be held for the seat of Lindsay. This by-election has to be held because the Labor Party is a bad loser. The former member for Lindsay, Miss Jackie Kelly, the woman the people of Lindsay chose to represent them in the federal parliament, was ruled ineligible for election because she was still employed by the RAAF when she nominated for the seat. Isn't that the crime of the country? To have the audacity to serve in this nation's defence forces and to also want to serve the people as an elected member of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no hesitation in telling you, Mr Acting Speaker, that the people of Australia are far better off having a young, vibrant, intelligent woman like Jackie Kelly as their representative than they would be having one of those tired, old, menopausal male has&hyphen;beens that Labor keeps putting up for re&hyphen;election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the Labor Party. They have a quota system for women, but it hasn't done the Labor women much good, has it? If Australians want more women in this House, then don't worry about the Labor Party's rigged quota system. If Australians want women in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliament, then vote Liberal. Vote for Jackie Kelly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The background to this by-election shows just how deeply and sincerely the Labor Party believes in democracy. That failed, old, has&hyphen;been Ross Free sought to have himself declared elected without going back to the electorate for a by-election. There was an 11&half; per cent swing against him just last March. Does he really think the people's decision counts for nothing? Labor was thrown out of office because of its arrogance, and here we have a typical example of that arrogance in Ross Free. What is Ross free of? Ross is free of scruples. He is free of morality. He is free of conscience. He is free of ideas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ross Free is also free of the burdens of office but he doesn't like the people's decision. He thinks his lust for power should override the wishes of the constituents of the seat of Lindsay. He is typical of the triple Ms in the Labor Party&mdash;middle-aged, misogynist men.

The constitution confers no exclusivity on political parties. In a letter from the Clerk of the House to the Independent member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) on 23 May, an explanation of procedures for Independents nominating for joint parliamentary committees was set out. In respect of those joint committees, an Independent member is able to make his or her nomination direct to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4222"> the Speaker. Mr Acting Speaker, this is exactly the arrangement I have been seeking with most other Independents for the past six months in relation to speaking lists.</PARA></TALK.START>

A motion of dissent to this ruling was eventually gagged by the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) who said, `They&mdash;the Independents&mdash;can't be allowed to have their say too often.'

It is under this system I am able to speak now. It is fair, and I accept it. Why, for democracy's sake, can this system not be adopted in debate on bills where the Speaker uses his or her discretion to inject us into the debate? We seek no more.

<TIME.STAMP>(10.09 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting the Australian Animal Health Council (Live&hyphen;stock Industries) Funding Bill 1996, I think what must be made clear is that it is putting another impost on Australian primary producers and I am concerned that we continually do this. We continually do this on the basis that we say we have their agreement. I am not at all sure that this is so. It is very clear if you look at the wool industry, which is in a crisis, that the Wool  Council does not represent the overwhelming view of growers. Yet the government and, for that matter, the opposition seem intent on backing this very small group and other noisy elements without any real consultation with the wool growers themselves. This is a situation that I believe has to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addressing this bill, one cannot escape putting AQIS&mdash;the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service&mdash;under some sort of scrutiny. For while it is true that a clean, green image is of great value to Australia, it is not at all clear that AQIS is in fact defending this. AQIS's job is, in my view, to make sure that Australia is kept as free as possible from the scourge of pests and diseases that exist overseas and do not exist in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There seems to be an element within AQIS&mdash;I suspect it is an element at the very highest level&mdash;that is obsessed with a rationalist economic view of the world which says something along the lines of `It will be better when we have all the same diseases throughout the world, and then we can play on a truly level playing field.' In fact, I have heard this view espoused by senior people in DPIE, and I have no doubt that it infects the very senior levels of AQIS. I want to make it clear when I attack AQIS that I am not attacking the staff, many of whom do a dedicated job. I have had them complain to me recently about the lack of facilities and funds to do the job properly.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4225">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decisions made by AQIS in recent times seem to owe more to politics than they do to science. GATT has become God. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is held up by both parties as some sort of shining star of a level playing field and free world trade. It is, of course, nothing of the sort. It is interesting to note the actions of other countries who sign GATT agreements. They immediately go out and try to find a way around them. For example, in fairly recent times, the French, having signed a GATT agreement, were within a few weeks banning Norwegian fish on the grounds of health. I am sure those grounds were totally spurious, but I commend the French government for protecting its industries. I just wish that our own government and the former government could have had the same enthusiasm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to look at a few of the things we have had inflicted on us recently. I believe that the reason Canadian pork was allowed in, despite the real risk of some diseases, was the threat to our beef exports. The Canadians had simply said, `If you don't do this, we will cut your beef.' We sell beef to the world&mdash;a very corrupt market&mdash;on price or quality, and that is the basis upon which the Canadians buy it. After having signed the agreement, they suddenly cut our beef anyway. It was something they were always going to do. There is a lesson there, but it is a lesson that I doubt will be learned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chicken meat is in the same category. There are diseases overseas that would be devastating if they arrived in Australia. Newcastle disease is one. Minister Anderson has said not to worry about newcastle disease, because it could be brought in on migratory birds. If it could be brought in on migratory birds, it would have been here long, long ago. The truth is, of course, that any migratory bird holding the disease at the contagious stage would die en route. It would not get here. The fact that it has never got here is an indication of that. That was a very naive statement by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the salmon debate. It is true that the last government did not allow the importation of salmon. One had the feeling it was inevitable and that things were moving in that direction, but the election saved it in the interim. I only hope that we will show a little more fortitude and not allow salmon products into Australia. This is not an economic argument in Australia, because our people are selling their salmon at a premium on world markets, against Canadian salmon. But, at the same time, we do not want people, such as Coles or Woolworths, importing dumped salmon and dropping it on the market here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some recent examples, some of which were actually referred to by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I must commend the member for O'Connor. I thought he spoke very well on this issue. Canola seed has been drawn to my attention by several constituents. Canola seed was imported from New Zealand. I am not sure that it was a superior strain; I think it was simply a cheaper strain. My inquiries tend to indicate that the importer&mdash;and, in fact, the agent for AQIS&mdash;WAQIS, the Western Australian government inspection service, knew that the seed contained foreign seeds or weed seeds, 12 in all, some of them very serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Red shank is one seed and there is another plant there that has the potential to be a skeleton weed. It does not exist in Australia. It is called cleavers. Certainly it can cause a lot of trouble in Western Australia, not only because of the cost of eradication but also because of the damage it can cause due to the levels of insecticide that we would have to incur if that seed is to be eradicated. I believe the costs of eradication must lie with the Western Australian government and that eradication must be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The golden apple snail is another example, brought in at the behest of aquarium owners. I am a fish fancier and I enjoy my aquarium and my pond but to allow a group like this to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4226"> bring in a snail that could devastate parts of our industry is totally irresponsible. This golden apple snail is now in Sydney. It is one of the major pests of the rice industry. I am told there are about eight major rice pests, either insects or diseases, and we have only one in Australia. We have a big advantage. Why would we throw it away with this totally irresponsible action?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fire blight is another one. Fire blight is a disease of apples that is prevalent throughout the world but it does not exist in Australia. New Zealand wants to sell us apples, although why we need New Zealand apples is beyond me. There is a lot of pressure there and one gets the feeling that the government does not have the political will to resist the New Zealand demands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe if one were to use freedom of information legislation and one had the time and the resources, one would find that the department itself does not believe that the measures being proposed by the New Zealanders will guarantee no entry of fire blight. Fire blight is a scourge of the apple industry but there are some species of apples, particularly the traditional species, that tend to be able to weather it. Obviously, that is so otherwise New Zealand would not have a very big apple industry.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very costly to control because it is a fungal disease and fungal spores can get in anywhere. If they get into cardboard packaging then there is absolutely no guarantee fire blight will not arrive in Australia. Once it arrives here it is beyond control. It has never been adequately controlled in any country in the world where it has become established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are new varieties of apples that are very susceptible to it but it totally devastates pears. The reason why New Zealand does not have a pear industry is, of course, that it has fire blight. The reason we have a pear industry&mdash;the Goulburn Valley is a great pear growing area&mdash;is that we do not have fire blight. It seems crazy to put at risk this industry in Australia simply because of some political pressure from New Zealand. I urge the government to totally reject the importation of New Zealand apples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reverse scenario also occurs, of course. AQIS has done things that I am aware of. It has been counterproductive when Australian companies have sought to export animals overseas. Just a few years ago I had a fellow in Western Australia who had an order for goats, paid for by the American government, to go to the Ukraine. He was going to source them out of Meekatharra. In fact, they were going to be flown direct to the Ukraine in very large Russian transport planes. However, AQIS stepped in and said that it could not allow this unless every goat was ultrasound tested before departure to make sure it was not pregnant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought this was absolutely absurd and I went to some trouble to find out a bit more. The AQIS people told me they were frightened of the Animal Welfare League and that they had had a case where goats had been shipped out of Sydney to Korea and they had experienced very high mortality rates en route. When I inquired amongst the trade I found out that what they had done was allow goats to be shipped out without grading for size. They had on the plane billygoats, young female goats and kids, and all in the same pens. The billygoats had trampled a lot of the young nannies and kids to death and as a result mayhem had ensued in Korea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I asked AQIS what it was going to do, it said it was sending a team of vets to Korea&mdash;obviously, at growers' expense&mdash;to find out what had happened. I made it clear that I would look very unfavourably at this. It was quite clear what had happened. It should have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4227"> realised when the goats were loaded. A bit of commonsense would have prevented that. Its draconian over&hyphen;reaction is so typical of what we have come to expect from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a processor in my electorate who has really pioneered the export of Australian scallops at high prices. He has been very successful. His name is Jimmy Chung from Far West Scallops&mdash;I am sure he will not mind my mentioning his name. We now import cheaper Canadian scallops and export ours at a premium price. He tried to get Indonesian sourced prawns into Taiwan. Taiwan has a policy of importing fish product from only Australia or Japan. Japan exports far more fish product than it catches. It obviously reprocesses and that gives it a very big advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We wanted to get these prawns from Indonesia. These prawns are readily available on the Australian market and are considered perfectly good and perfectly adequate for Australian consumption. We wanted to repack them with wording that went along the lines, `Indonesian prawns. Packed and processed in Australia. Guaranteed fit for human consumption in Australia.' That was a form of words which would have satisfied the Taiwanese, but you just simply could not get that through AQIS. It would not allow them to be branded as anything other than Indonesian prawns. That absolutely outrageous decision was upheld by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are lots of other examples. I saw in the paper the other day that Cannon Foods in Perth&mdash;a very competent organisation&mdash;is looking to export downstream processed Australian product. It had inquiries from Australian embassies to supply one of its chicken products. It wanted to supply those products to Australian embassies so that the embassies could use them as promotional food when they were entertaining people. This was banned again by AQIS. It was said that the small volume involved certainly in initial stages just could not be supported on the plans and the requirements that AQIS had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that, if AQIS is going to have any relevance for Australia, it has to get back to its charter of protecting us from the import of pests and diseases. It also has to enhance the export of Australian product. In many cases, user pays is a fine catchphrase. But if the user has no say in what the standards and the requirements are, it really ends up as nothing less than extortion and an action by an Australian government entity in restraint of trade. AQIS's behaviour in this area can be documented&mdash;it is not good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that we should be encouraging a lot more bilateral arrangements. For instance, if a Japanese producer is happy with a standard in Australia&mdash;and why would it not be happy, Japan imports stuff from Third World countries whose conditions are horrific when compared with ours&mdash;then that is all that should be required. If that company is satisfied, that company can make its inspections as frequently as it likes and it can test the stuff on arrival. If that is what is required, then that is all that should be required in terms of exports. The government should clearly be facilitating trade, not in any way acting in restraint of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People feel that when you have a body like AQIS that it is doing the job. But I would say that Australia has never been under greater threat from the arrival of diseases. With the advent of air travel, we can cross the world in a single day. With the advent of migration of large numbers from Third World countries, the threat has never been greater. The threat posed by migrants wanting to bring with them material from their homelands is a significant threat. We need to be stepping up our quarantine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because this is something that affects the whole nation, it should not be charged just to exporters. To say `The user pays' is an absolute nonsense because, for instance, if foot&hyphen;andmouth disease were to get established in the Murray Valley, it is estimated that it would take <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4228"> two out of five jobs in Australia. It is in the national interest, not just in the interest of importers, that AQIS operates, and the government should accept that it has to pay a lot of these charges from the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is room for streamlining in AQIS, there is room for changes in procedures, but we cannot accept the downgrading of our quarantine regulations. The actions seem to be to downgrade quarantine regulations on incoming produce but to increase the requirements on stuff leaving the country. That certainly is illogical and irrational and it is something we have to address. If we do not address it, we are going to miss out on an enormous potential market that does exist in the world for downstream processed Australian food. I hope that the government will pay some attention to it, although the recent utterances of the minister indicate that this is unlikely.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Mitchell)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.27 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to pick up on some of the lines raised by my colleague opposite. In particular, I draw to the attention of the Main Committee and of my fellow Australians the discussions that are going on now in government circles concerning the Australian chicken meat industry and the prospect of imported chicken meat from the United States and Thailand. The previous government struggled with this issue for a lengthy period of time. The minister of the day, Senator Collins, was unable to make a decision but the indications were that he was willing to accept the risk of the import of processed chicken meat from Thailand. This has been a matter of real concern for the Australian chicken meat producing industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that in issues of this type there has to be some acknowledgment given that Australian producers will seek to protect their interests and their markets, and they will quite properly raise a variety of arguments to defend their position. The role of government in these circumstances is to determine whether the issues that the Australian producers raise are legitimate arguments or whether they are arguments raised purely to secure their own share of the market and prevent an attack from imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this instance, I have endeavoured to examine the arguments of the industry and the arguments that government has consistently regurgitated, and those views are mainly the views of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. Both Senator Collins and to a lesser degree Mr Anderson have been captive to the views of AQIS. That is understandable because many ministers are reluctant to be courageous or adventurous in an area where they lack expertise, and they have paid servants who supposedly possess the expertise to advise them. And so around Australia I have noted, both in the Sydney and Melbourne regions in particular, a concern expressed by members of parliament representing the view of their chicken meat producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my endeavour to examine these matters I have attended meetings of expert veterinarians, of poultry experts who would be ranked as world authorities, who very much contest the view of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service that it is safe to import cooked chicken meat from Thailand. These veterinarians have written textbooks. One I call to mind is Tom Hungerford, an Australian name in the poultry industry and also one of very significant international standing. He, amongst others, says that the risk to the Australian poultry industry and Australian bird life is very great indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unknown factors are these: we do not know the hygiene, conditions or protocols that will be applied to the preparation of cooked chicken meat by the country from which we are importing. That is so indefinite, so dangerous and so likely to be done in chicken producing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4229"> areas that diseases will be brought into Australia. Those diseases will spread through the Australian flocks and into Australian bird life. One of the downsides in the predictions made by the avian veterinarians is that there is a chance that 80 per cent of the Australian parrot population could be wiped out, because parrots are evidently very susceptible to newcastle disease. This could mean the complete elimination of some species of parrot and the survival of others at only a 50 per cent rate, with the average wipe&hyphen;out being about 80 per cent. I think that most Australians would reject risking that occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AQIS is relying on the work done by Alexander, back in 1988&hyphen;89 or somewhere about that period, for a New Zealand firm. The extension of work carried out on egg yolks to the importation of chicken meat is a fairly tenuous link, but scientists are prepared to accept that newcastle disease can be killed under certain conditions, if a high enough temperature is applied for a sufficient length of time. That was the basis of Alexander's work done on egg yolks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a nation, we appear to be very willing to put at risk not only the economic circumstances and benefit of Australian families but also our heritage in order to gain the short&hyphen;term benefit of maybe trading in beef with certain areas around the world. We ought to have a consistent line that is understandable and arguable. We have a unique population of native fauna, and it must be understandable to anybody around the world that we need to protect that fauna from imported disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have an image that is green and clean for agricultural production, and that green and clean image is a great advantage to Australia in selling its commodities around the world. It is one of our strong marketing feats that we can claim that Australian production processes are minimally interfered with by disease and by the chemicals and treatments on which much of Europe and North America must rely in order to gain economic production. There would be nothing that would suit Australia's competitors more than having an outbreak of newcastle disease or fire blight in Australia to limit our economic capacity and also to limit the markets to which we could gain entry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I put to the House the significance of the Senate inquiry that is currently taking place into the protocols for the import of chicken meat. I wish to encourage veterinarians and those with expertise, as well as those in the Australian industry and Australian conservationists who care for Australian fauna, to take a very active interest in that current inquiry and, if they have expertise that is relevant to the inquiry, to come forward. Australian conservationists seem to be more interested in the ozone layer than they are in the Australian parrot population. They seem to be much more interested in whether there is going to be an appropriate amount of ozone miles above the earth rather than in whether the very population that makes Australia unique for its birds and animals will be allowed to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am amazed at the attitudes within the Australian Conservation Foundation. When I have written to them on this basis, there is either a failure to reply or a cursory telephone call. There is no real interest whatsoever in the things that, to me, matter as far as preservation of Australia's uniqueness and a real attitude of conservation go. They would rather get involved in chasing whales around the shores of Australia or in attending some esoteric conference&mdash;paid for by government, usually&mdash;where they discuss the ozone layer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is time that we dealt with the realities of conservation and exposed some of the so&hyphen;called conservationists as mere theorists lacking any scientific expertise or any practical experience in the areas in which they proclaim themselves to be expert. It is time that we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4230"> started to deal with issues such as desertification and the import of goods from overseas that are likely to influence or interfere with Australia's bird population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I wish to place on record some of the comments that I am receiving from the minister&mdash;but drafted, no doubt, by AQIS&mdash;which outline the significance of Australia's international trading position, our dependence on international markets and the need for us to establish a process that is transparent, that is liberal and that recognises that we are gaining access to markets in Japan, California or the Philippines. It would seem to me that to compare access to Japan for Australian rice&mdash;free of disease, of the highest quality and grown under conditions that cannot be emulated in Japan&mdash;with the entry from a disease ridden area of a commodity that has real risk and difficulty attached to it is a false comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does not mean to say that trading nations such as Japan, the Philippines or the United States would see it with Australian eyes. I understand that because trade is a matter of self&hyphen;interest; it is not always a matter where you can lay down rules of process that will be followed by the participants. There is a fair degree of self&hyphen;interest amongst Californian fruit producers to see that Australian fruit does not get into their area, and I understand that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not an argument that we are having about the import of processed chicken meat to Australia that steers away from self&hyphen;interest. But I am raising today the fact that, if you put self&hyphen;interest to one side, there is sufficient scientific basis for us to reject the import of chicken meat into Australia without reference to any of the matters of trade or protectionism, or the arguments that are often raised by Australian producers or processors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AQIS argument runs the international trade argument. And it is very important that the Australian government and the minister are active in markets such as the Philippines, Mexico and the United States and, in the APEC context, are pressing for improved market liberalisation. But we have always had a claim that there ought to be market liberalisation because both our cost of production and the quality of our production exceed that of most other nations. We are lower in the production cost, and we are higher in the quality and lower in the contamination of our food products in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the very time that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is launching our supermarket into Asia strategy, which is one of the great drives he has put together for us to be more effective in marketing into Asia, one of the most compelling arguments will be the lack of contamination and the high quality of our food products. So to mount the trade argument that we need to give away concessions which will ultimately run the risk of damaging that food quality seeks, in my opinion, to strike at the very basis of our most compelling and productive argument when we seek to trade with others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AQIS consideration of the whole of this newcastle disease debate has been that it is based on the work of Alexander and the extension of his work to apply to cooked chicken meat. In my opinion, AQIS has refused to consider the proper basis and the full gamut of the protocols, and has argued not only the trade argument but, in my view, a spurious consumer argument which says that the Australian consumer will benefit from cheaper chicken meat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exact benefit is about 30c per chicken imported into Australia, if they come as whole chickens. I think if it were put to the Australian people they would gladly pay that extra 30c per chicken in order to continue to eat clean Australian chicken and maintain the Australian parrot population. However, put that to one side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of cleaning up an outbreak of newcastle disease in Australia&mdash;if you can get it cleaned up&mdash;is roughly estimated at $30 million. If you spread the advantage to the consumer <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4231"> over a period of time it would be, say, $3 million a year over the 10&hyphen;year period. So if there is one outbreak of newcastle disease in a 10&hyphen;year period, all economic advantage is lost to the consumer, the Australian government and everybody else. The tenuous nature of what is being proposed here makes it impossible in pure business and logic terms, and I cannot see the political advantage either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out to AQIS that there needs to be a new day and age, and a change in the way in which they do things. My colleague has argued his cases. I am arguing the chicken case. I will also bring up an instance where some of my constituents sought to export product to Japan. They got a phytosanitary certificate from AQIS which said they had a clean product, and it was proved on arrival in Japan that the product was not clean. So one must assume it may not have been inspected properly or may not have been inspected at all. When confronted by my constituent about whether this product was clean and whether it was inspected, AQIS said, `Our phytosanitary certificate is just one of the mechanisms used to gain export and entry.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that under the law of Australia you cannot send the stuff out without the certificate, and it is a law of Japan that they will not import it unless there is a government&hyphen;issued phytosanitary certificate. AQIS is saying, `It does not matter much whether we have it or not. It is a bit of paper that travels with straw, hay, or whatever, and we are just not really concerned about the status of that certificate.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem to me that, if we are going to build confidence in Australian exporters and with our clients overseas, the very first thing that AQIS must do is guarantee the quality of their certificates. And by guaranteeing the quality of their certificates I believe they will gain prestige for themselves, because nothing could be more significant for an Australian exporter to say than, `Here is an Australian government certificate that guarantees the quality of the product free from vegetable and animal contamination.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it were to be proved that, inadvertently, the inspection had not been done effectively or that there was a dormant disease or an insect egg that incubated in the process of transport and sprang to life on arrival in Japan, and the product had to be dumped, set aside or fumigated or had to undergo some such process, then I would have thought that if AQIS wanted to establish a real integrity they would guarantee their decision and they would guarantee the replacement of any losses caused both to the exporter or the importer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely that would be a very small guarantee, spread across a period of years, and is a very simple commercial device practised by practically everybody who wishes to maintain a consistent market. I would have thought reinsurance or some sort of insurance covering the phytosanitary certificates issued by AQIS would be just an elemental thing that they should be looking at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about the prospect of imported chicken meat into Australia. I wish Senator Winston Crane well in his inquiry. I hope it is a very thorough and successful inquiry and that the Senate committee is able to draw on the full scientific expertise of Australia and overseas. I hope that they are able to examine very carefully the Alexander decision of 1988 on egg yolk and whether it can be extended to permit the import of chicken meat from Thailand. Above all, I encourage the minister and the department to maintain the clean, green image that Australian products have so much. It is our strongest selling point and something we must always maintain. I would also like to encourage AQIS to be proud enough of their organisation to be able to back their decisions and their certificates with guarantees that actually mean <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4232"> something in international trade markets&mdash;something of real worth, something that they will stand behind and something that we can feel as a nation we will support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is not often that I rise on matters to do with primary industry or agriculture. A former Minister for Primary Industries, John Kerin, used to always ask me when I was going to get up and protect the interests of the farmers of Thomastown. Anybody who knows the suburb of Thomastown knows that the predominant employment there is industrial. But today I find I rise here to speak on behalf of two of the 207 persons employed in agriculture in Scullin. In doing so, I indicate that it is not only on behalf of those people that I speak. In those industrial areas of my electorate, we have many food processors and they are very keen to see that the green and clean image of Australia's food produce is protected. It is that downstream processing of primary industry that is, of course, very important to the overwhelming number of people of my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another reason that I find myself a bit bemused by the potential of my contribution in today's debate is that I agree nearly entirely with what the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) has said. This did have me a little worried but I have overcome that worry. I think that he outlined a very good case about the potential of decisions that might be made on the chicken meat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chicken industry in Australia employs around 62,000 people, both directly and indirectly. Many of these are smaller primary producers and are involved in many different stages of the production process. I have been approached, like many other members, by many chicken farmers concerned about the implication of the decision to allow imported cooked chicken meat on their livelihoods, on Australia's health and on our natural environment. I took the opportunity to visit one of these people who contacted me, who lives and works in my electorate. These people describe themselves as poultry farmers and I was very impressed by the quality of their operation. This farmer is one of the smaller primary producers. Each 10 to 12 weeks he receives about 25,000 day&hyphen;old chicks from the chicken processing company he is contracted to. For eight to 10 weeks the chickens are housed in the two large sheds on the farm, with sophisticated heating, water and feed systems. The chickens are given a course of feed, which is supplied by the contracting company. The nutritional content of the feed alters with the age of the bird.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the completion of the cycle, the chickens are returned to the company. The mortality rate among the chickens is low, only around three to four per cent of the birds. The sheds housing the birds are then thoroughly cleaned and there is a two&hyphen;week break before the cycle begins again. The farmer receives payment for the batch of 25,000. It is not an enormous amount of money, after the farmer has deducted the cost of gas for heating, electricity and water. Water represents a large component of the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that many of these smaller primary producers live pretty close to the edge with their running costs. Although these smaller primary producers run their own business, they are contracted to a chicken processing company and receive a set amount per bird for the cycle that the birds are in their care. Of course, it could be argued that they are in fact contracted employees of the chicken processing companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If cooked chicken meat is allowed to be imported, it is precisely these smaller primary producers who will be effectively locked out of the system. Rather than have contracts with many small farmers, the large chicken processing companies will undoubtedly prefer to deal with a chain of farms or with the big agribusiness farmers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4233">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chicken farmer in my electorate is not just concerned with the effects of imported chicken meat on his own business, he is genuinely concerned about the health implications of the decision and the potential environmental consequences. As has been indicated, there has been work undertaken by AQIS and, based on those studies, they have come to a position. I assert it is still necessary to make certain that the conditions surrounding the importation of cooked chicken meat are satisfactory by further investigation. There are too many horror stories for it to go ahead without being 100 per cent in the clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, and not totally unrelated, there are the stories of the Brazilian chickens pumped so full of oestrogen to quicken their development that they began to affect the speed of development of the children who ate them. I agree with the honourable member for Mitchell that it is pleasing to see that the whole issue has been referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs Legislation Committee and I totally endorse the points of the honourable member for Mitchell in encouraging people to make submissions to that inquiry. I believe that in this instance an open public inquiry, such as can be conducted by the Senate committee, is appropriate. As the honourable member for Mitchell and others have said, we have to protect our image as an acclaimed producer in primary produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An earlier experience I had with AQIS involved a chicken meat processor who operates in the suburb of Thomastown. The operator came to me with a problem in getting the proper certification of his works on the basis of the quality of the water that was being used. What was interesting about this tale was that this operator was using the same water supplied by Melbourne Water to the surrounding suburbs. This was water that was good enough to be used in a domestic sense by the surrounding suburbs and it fulfilled World Health Organisation standards for water but, given the very tight and conservative nature of the requirements of AQIS, it was not of sufficient standard to be used in the washing processes in a chicken processing plant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony, I thought, was that this business was about to embark upon a niche market in Asia for chicken feet. The thing that was a stumbling block was the quality of water. In the end, the operator solved the problem by installing an ultraviolet filtration system to ensure that the standard of the water enabled him to get the certification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, we need to see that this position of allowing in cooked chicken meat is investigated thoroughly. It applies to a significant primary industry employing tens of thousands of Australians. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has argued that Australia needs to do this in the interests of trade liberalisation to benefit our own farmers. However, trade liberalisation should not mean jeopardising our own standards or unnecessarily risking our own environment. Destroying the livelihoods of Australia's efficient small primary producers and those who depend on them is hardly good for our own economy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that the debate this morning so far has been relatively focused on the chicken industry but the bill does cover a number of other industries. Obviously previous speakers have taken a keen interest in that particular issue at the moment. It is quite topical as far as the importation of chicken meat is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in the remarks from the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) with regard to an attitude that prevails within this government and the previous government towards international trade arrangements under GATT. I just highlight to the member for Kalgoorlie that there are a number of us who take the attitude that we are watching and seeing how beneficial it is. Whilst I personally acknowledge the philosophy behind trade liberalisation, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4234"> the process in achieving the ultimate goal is not always equitable. Certainly at the moment there is anecdotal evidence that it is not equitable either. So on that basis I would probably disagree a little bit with the member for Kalgoorlie on that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue that has been commented on fairly generally this morning is with regard to the way we as a nation discharge our international responsibilities and how we treat the import&hyphen;export arrangements and our bilateral trade arrangements. As far as the importation of the chicken meat is concerned, I am sure that as a nation exporting commodities and a lot of primary produce we are expected to go over much higher hurdles sometimes than what we impose on imports into this country. One of the previous speakers was talking about the export of rice. If we think of the process and the lengthy negotiations that this country has had to go through to be able to export rice to Japan, the restrictions that are put on us and the requirements that we must meet compared to other nations, certainly we see that the process and the progress of the development of world trade liberalisation is not equitable. I think that we should always bear that in mind when making decisions such as this with regard to the non&hyphen;direct tariff/subsidy type arrangements with commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of the previous speakers have focused to a large extent on the chicken industry. I want to focus a little bit on a couple of our other primary industries that have associated and not totally unrelated problems at the moment. I know this bill is about protecting what we have got in this country. I suppose that when people in Australia go to the shop, to the supermarket or to the butcher's shop to buy beef, lamb or chicken, they just take for granted that it is in pristine condition, that we do not have any exotic diseases in Australia and that there is no fear of foot&hyphen;and&hyphen;mouth disease or mad cow disease and all the sorts of things that are evident in other countries. Generally, the population takes that too much for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that Australia's very good track record in this regard should be highlighted. Perhaps that record causes other nations to which we are trying to export to raise the bar, so to speak, and to try to slow us down. There are so many other nations around the world which do not have such a good track record on animal diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We obviously support the bill before the Main Committee today. The purpose of this bill and the associated amendments to a number of primary industry levy acts is to direct funds to the Australian Animal Health Council Ltd. This will allow the beef, sheep meat, egg, chicken meat and pork industries to meet their funding obligations to the council. The Australian Animal Health Council Ltd has been established as a non&hyphen;profit company and will be jointly owned and funded by the Commonwealth government, state and territory governments and the peak national representative bodies of Australia's livestock&hyphen;based industries. Its mission will be to ensure that the Australian animal health service system is capable of maintaining acceptable national animal health standards which meet consumer needs and market requirements at home and overseas. That is described in the second reading speech, which also describes the structure of this body. Under `Remarks' in the bills digest it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the provisions of this bill are of a non controversial technical nature, the use of a non statutory corporation as a disbursement vehicle for public and private funds differs from the more traditional statutory disbursement vehicle in a number of respects, including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the AAHC is not required to prepare an annual report which must be tabled in parliament;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the AAHC is not subject to the Audit Act of 1901; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it is unclear whether the AAHC is subject to the Senate Estimates process. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4235">  </PARA>
<PARA>Bear in mind, that this body is being funded by governments, both Commonwealth, and state and territory, and by industry. So there is a very broad range of public funds being applied in this exercise. As a member of the Public Accounts committee&mdash;and we are just reviewing the Audit Act and looking at a new Auditor&hyphen;General's bill&mdash;I think that the parliament, generally, and the government should watch that the responsibilities of this organisation are dispersed when it is structured in such a manner. I am not saying that it is not an acceptable manner but, certainly, it is new as far as a statutory authority is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had instances recently where different government departments have been less than prudent in their oversight of the expenditure of public funds. For instance, the future tech project, I understand, had many millions of dollars worth of taxpayers' and levy payers' funds and, to all intents and purposes, these were lost in that failed project. We should flag that. The minister and his department should monitor the process as it takes place once this organisation comes into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, the whole exercise is about guarding and protecting Australian industries. The annual report from EXANDIS&mdash;the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council&mdash;says that there are 54 animal diseases currently not present, but which could enter Australia and threaten our livestock industry. We all know what difficulties our primary industries are facing as far as exports are concerned and we certainly do not want to see the incursion of any of these diseases into Australia. They may jeopardise those very important domestic and export industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EXANDIS goes on to say that the best known of the diseases with the most serious potential impact is foot&hyphen;and&hyphen;mouth disease. It has been prevalent in a lot of the countries overseas, some of which would like to break into some of the marketplaces that we currently occupy overseas. It is important from that perspective that we support and bolster the activities and the appropriations that are being outlined in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its final annual report EXANDIS urged government and industry to maintain, through the AAHC Ltd, a high level of continued activity aimed at protecting Australia against exotic animal diseases and preparing for any outbreaks. EXANDIS considered that the greatest exotic animal disease threats to Australia are foot&hyphen;and&hyphen;mouth disease, newcastle disease, bluetongue and classical swine fever. As I say, we have heard a fair bit about newcastle disease here this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AAHC was born out of concerns that Australia might not be able to meet the demands of trading partners for information on animal health and welfare, unless a number of fundamental changes were made for the delivery of animal health services. The AAHC Ltd, is an unlisted public company, as I said. It was established following agreement in August 1995, by the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia. It is unique in its structure, in that it is a non&hyphen;statutory corporation administering public and private funds. It differs from the more traditional industry and statutory bodies, such as AMLC and MRC&mdash;and I want to make some comments on those couple of bodies shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the advantage of this structure is that the AAHC is still accountable to its members, is more flexible in nature and is relatively cost&hyphen;effective in its administration. As I said before, we should be monitoring its effectiveness and the way it is administered. There are a lot of public funds going to be applied to this body, and so it is important that we do that on the basis of the manner in which other statutory bodies have expended public funds <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4236"> and discharged their responsibilities. They are bodies that have been under the direct scrutiny of the parliament and the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to an associated issue, with the current review that the minister and the department are undertaking with regard to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the MRC and the MIC, there has been a lot of public comment, particularly from the relevant industries that are involved. I have attended a number of public meetings, predominantly of beef producers in my electorate who are not satisfied with the way the AMLC and its associated bodies have discharged their responsibilities. The producers are not satisfied as levy payers, and this is associated with the issue that we are debating today, because the funds are coming in part from industry as well as from government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The producers in my area are not satisfied that the levies that they pay are being spent to the best advantage of the industry, and particularly of the producers. They are not satisfied that they have adequate representation on any of those bodies. They are in a minority, and the processing sector has the majority view from its end of the industry on all of those bodies. As I say, there has been an enormous amount of public comment as to what should be happening with the restructuring of those bodies. At this stage, I have not been convinced that we should not have two separate species bodies controlling sheep meats and beef meats and live cattle and live sheep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that there has been a conflict of interest within the AMLC, probably on a four&hyphen;way basis, between the sheep industry, the beef industry, the processors and the producers. They are all mixed into the one melting pot together, all trying to achieve a goal. There is a great question mark now over whether generic marketing is the way to go, when you consider what some of the people that we trade against in the world marketplace are doing with their commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That raises the next question regarding getting some sort of agreement throughout the industry with regard to grading. It has been a bone of contention within the beef industry for a lot of years that there has never been agreement on a grading system. We are now getting to a stage as far as world competitiveness and access to markets are concerned where, unless the national industry&mdash;and it will probably take leadership from the government, the department and the minister&mdash;agrees to decide on a universally accepted grading system, we are going to be continually put at a disadvantage in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking in support of this bill, I have a couple of points to make in closing. We must continue to support this sort of monitoring. As I say, we probably take too much for granted in this country the fact that we benefit from living in a disease&hyphen;free island nation. We do not have common borders with other countries where we can see diseases coming across those borders. We must continue to monitor, and it is very important that the government plays its role in industry as well. I highlight the fact again that, with this new structure for a limited company that is using government funds, public moneys and levies that are being applied to its exercise, we should monitor the way that it has gone. Maybe in the future there should be a report brought back with regard to how this particular structure has worked in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the opportunity to urge the minister to bring in the report while there is an end date to the review into the beef industry and to bring down his response to that as soon as possible. The beef industry is in crisis and the beef industry is looking for leadership. As far as I am concerned, I think there is leadership throughout the industry but at different levels. I think the beef industry is looking for some leadership and some direction from government. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4237"> time is right to restructure those processes and statutory bodies so they better reflect what the industry wishes, they better reflect the producers in the industry and they better reflect the market in which we have got to operate internationally in the 1990s. With those few comments, I will finish there in support of the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

He is with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who is launching the Supermarket to Asia strategy here in Canberra at this time. It is a privilege for me to represent the minister on this very important piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank all those who have participated in this debate. There have been some issues raised that I will comment on. I think it is important that we have had a wide&hyphen;ranging debate from both sides and I know that some of the comments made certainly have not gone unnoticed by the minister and the minister's office. To an industry as important as the beef industry and agriculture generally, not only to this nation but also to employment in regional Australia, these amendments are certainly important. They are certainly going to tidy up some of the mess that was left behind by the Labor Party in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments to these bills remove the retrospective application of the levies. As the bill stands, the levies will come into effect from 1 July 1996 on receiving royal assent. The amendments will ensure that the levies come into effect from the first day of the month at least 30 days after the act commences. A retrospective application of the levies and charges would disadvantage producers, levy payers and intermediaries who collect the levies on the Commonwealth's behalf. A retrospective application would also impose considerable additional cost on the levies management unit, the LMU, in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, in its attempts to recover the additional levies. The LMU is a cost recovery area, so costs incurred are passed on to industry and impact on the funding of the Australian Animal Health Council. Associated industry bodies, such as the promotional and research and development bodies, are also funded by these levies. It would have an adverse affect on those bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 30&hyphen;day period after the act commences will ensure that levy payers and intermediaries who will collect the levies receive sufficient notice before the levies come into effect. An additional amendment to the Laying Chicken Levy Amendment (AAHC) Bill 1996 will remove the unnecessary duplication of the provision which limits the levy to no more than the amount recommended to the minister. This provision is already included in the Laying Chicken Levy Amendment Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the Australian Animal Health Council (Live&hyphen;stock Industries) Funding Bill 1996, the Meat Chicken Levy Amendment (AAHC) Bill 1996 and the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment (AAHC) Bill 1996, are not being amended. These bills do not impose a rate of levy and so have no retrospective application date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their contributions to this debate several members raised the issue of the application for importation into Australia of cooked chicken meat from Thailand, Denmark and the United States. I should reiterate several points previously raised on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record. In May the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy made it clear that these are not new applications, rather that they date from the late 1980s. They have been the subject of extended analysis by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4238"> both government and industry. Under legislation, the procedure for such applications is that they are referred for scientific analysis of disease threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service recommended in June 1994 that cooked product should be admitted provided that it met certain strict conditions, including time and temperature parameters, which would inactivate disease agents of concern. In the consultation phase that followed, the effectiveness of the proposed time and temperature parameters as a minimum treatment against disease agents was agreed by a wide range of independent scientific authorities. It was also agreed by the Australian Poultry Industry Association and the National Poultry Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AQIS advised the former minister, in the former administration, on 30 May 1995&mdash;and I stress that it was May of last year&mdash;that the technical assessments were complete and that access would be granted to the United States of America, Denmark and possibly Thailand. It is very important that that is on the public record and that it is reinforced: that the former minister in the previous administration agreed to those technical assessments that were complete on 30 May 1995. The previous minister noted this, without caveat, on 2 June last year. So it is hypocritical of those on the opposite side to come into this place and criticise this decision. It is a decision that was supported from the other side.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the incompetent approach of the previous administration, which is its legacy, Minister Anderson has engaged in extensive discussions with industry. All honourable members should acknowledge that the coalition government has established two working groups&mdash;one on the establishment of imported protocols and one on any economic and adjustment effects arising from the importation of cooked chicken meat. These groups were established with the full involvement of industry. A major industry and government meeting was convened at the minister's instruction and chaired by the minister in June this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to make some observations about the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 I should say to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) that there was a reason for my interjecting during his summing up of the previous legislation. AQIS is related to this bill for meat inspection, food quality and all those things, so we can find plenty of hangovers if he wants to. I thought he <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4242"> was being unkind when he said that he was coming in to clean up Labor's mess because, although he may not be aware of it, all of the items contained in that legislation are simply rolling forms of the&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! The honourable member is speaking on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), not the matter just resolved by the House.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am relating it, Mr Deputy Speaker, to a general observation I am making about the fact that, if you go to the second reading speech in relation to this bill, you will see that the amendments being made here relate partly to the quarantine service. I think that the quarantine service has food inspection issues related to it, so I will make some observations on it anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I am saying to the minister is that the rolling changes that have been made to all these pieces of agricultural legislation are simply that. They were in process. The government has simply continued what we set going, and in fact it has been supported by us for exactly the same reasons. I just made the point that I thought he was a bit unkind, that is all, for those reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody seems to be wandering around with some confusion over those observations I made about quarantine. My briefing notes here tell me that the purpose of this bill is to make amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act, the Fisheries Management Act, the Farm Household Support Act, the Imported Food Control Act and the Quarantine Act. That is what they tell me. They are the government's own notes that came to us, so I do not know why the minister is confused about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To move on from there, I have to say to the minister that I was enjoying his discomfort about the issue of imported chicken meat, having heard the sorts of things he wandered around Australia saying and noting that he is now simply picking up and moving on with exactly what was in process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will set the minister a challenge. I remember John Kerin telling me once, when we came to office in 1983, that something like 125 or 150 was the number for the minutiae of agriculture bills which had been created by the old Liberal&hyphen;National Party administration, as it tried to legislate for every specific farm activity you could possibly find. With a whole lot of effort over a number of years, we have probably managed to get it down to about 75&mdash;I do not know. There is a challenge for the minister. For as long as his party is the government he should see if he can remove some of this for us. He should see if he can get this down to maybe a handful of sensible pieces of legislation, instead of all these levies, laying acts and heaven knows what.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that one of the amendments being introduced in the legislation is to ensure that drought relief payments are payable to eligible farmers only within the period specified on the drought exceptional circumstances certificate. I can only assume that it has been necessary to do that because we have been having payments outside the exceptional circumstances certificate. I do not know why that would be so, but if it has to be, it has to be. If it means that we are tightening up drought relief, then I am sure that the honourable minister opposite (Mr Bruce Scott) will be able to go round and explain to his constituency why we are having to do that. If it has to be, I am glad that it is.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4243">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will also note in the second reading speech that one of the amendments will allow quarantine officers of the various state and territory departments to be involved in the inspection of food imported into Australia. I think that it is important to make this point because there is certainly a perception conveyed in regional Australia that Australian producers and processors face great barriers when attempting to export food products into other countries. They will constantly tell you that you can bring anything into Australia where we do not have the same situation. I am sure that the honourable minister opposite has been one of the ones wandering around Australia saying that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that foods imported into Australia face significant testing and quality control processes and it is a nonsensical claim to say otherwise. I hope that the new government will take some steps to make it clear that not only are foods imported into Australia subject to inspection and quality assessment issues but also more resources are being made available to ensure that happens, because we hear a lot about unlevel playing fields.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is excellent. There was a meeting&mdash;I think in Bathurst&mdash;where the former Prime Minister and a range of industry leaders in food processing, the farm sector and the transport sector looked at what things were required to bring this all together and really explore the food bowls for Asia concept. The document that was released from there had an action plan with a whole lot of key points. I was reading the other day the release from the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) announcing all these new initiatives. Every one of those key points was there and I thought, `Ah, isn't that wonderful?' This was what led me earlier to make the observation that I thought the minister was being a bit unkind. I am perfectly happy to say that I am glad to see the new government picking up these things, maintaining the consistency and running them through. But it would not hurt the new government to acknowledge that there is a process here and, where we have a bit of bipartisanship, we ought to be promoting that in the general community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made those observations, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are well aware, this is an omnibus bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When enacted, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 will be an omnibus bill. It will address areas of agriculture and provide amendments to acts from as diverse a spread as veterinary science, regulatory adjustment to fisheries, quarantine, household farm support and food control. Similarly, it will repeal 15 inoperative acts which, following a departmental review by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, are acts that were either superseded or which were intended to have effect for only a certain period of time, which has now expired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4244">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Paterson&mdash;an electorate of over 9,000 square kilometres possessing some of the most productive grazing land and agricultural output in Australia through its predominance in beef, dairy produce, timber, seafood, poultry, vegetable produce and, of course, not forgetting the very much adjacent world&hyphen;class wineries of the Hunter Region&mdash;I will be getting right behind and supporting any legislative change that improves the lot of the primary industry sector. With the people of Paterson very much steeped and enriched with primary sector pursuits, it is important to highlight how the wave of the legislatory wand in the House can be applied to deliver an agri&hyphen;industry that will put more and better quality food on a nation's table and, more importantly, deliver valuable export dollars that enhance the nation's accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To build on one of the great religious stories, it would be fair to say that my region can and does deliver both the fishes and the loaves. The fishing industry, built around the tranquil coastal fishing villages and the majestic Port Stephens region, has the infrastructure and the environment to reap great rewards for the region and help to balance the import/export ledger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) has just announced, the Howard government is determined to realise the multimillion dollar potential of our marine resources. By the year 2020, the nation's marine resources are expected to generate many extra hundreds of millions of dollars in annual turnover. It is a phenomenal figure. But when you break down the reality of pressing overseas demand for our clean and outstanding fish and seafood, the access to maritime resources over an area almost twice as large as our island continent itself and the real initiatives promoted by the supermarket to Asia and the world strategy of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), it is not hard to see that vision and hard work can and will reach this astronomical trading performance inside two decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this legislation, the Howard government, in implementing an amendment to the former government's Fishery Management Act 1991, is directly reacting to the requests of the fishing industry, which has called for amendments following the outcome of several court cases that have related to fisheries, and other areas of concern relating to property rights and the examination of effects of the current provisions of an act on the level of security for statutory fishing rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Fisheries Management Act provides for the issue of statutory fishing rights under fishery management plans. These rights are created by statute. In other words, rights created by statute can be withdrawn by statute without necessarily requiring the payment of compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current reality provides that no compensation is payable because the fishing right is cancelled, ceases to have effect or ceases to apply to an individual fishery. The amendment seeks to clarify that, where there is an acquisition of property within the meaning of the constitution. Some recent court decisions in this very area have raised the question of circumstances where application of the provision may be contrary to paragraph 51(xxxi) of the federal constitution and therefore deemed invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of the act is, as it presently stands&mdash;and I am sure it was intended&mdash;that it was never meant to be an unfair and unconscionable piece of legislation. Yet the legal reality is that fishing rights can be cancelled in writing without any consideration of the cost or impost to the actual licensee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many cases these are individual fishermen, individual small enterprises and hardworking people who do not need another slug from government. The Howard government is determined to stick to the key priorities, one of which is getting the monkey and the government off the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4245"> back of business and allowing them to do what they do best; that is, being in business and getting ahead. The potential loss of profit and hard&hyphen;earned income by not passing this amendment is simply untenable. I would think it most untenable to the representatives of the local fishing and seafood industry that embraces Paterson electorate and, of course, the entire Australian seaboard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another key amendment in this legislation is the amendment to the Imported Food Control Act 1992. Even if you are not an avid reader of the newspaper, or aware of Australian trade policy, I am sure the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and its role in the quarantine of imported food&mdash;in the interests of human health&mdash;would get a gentle nod from many people. AQIS has been put through the wringer in recent times. The Nairn inquiry will, in due course, address and assess its overall operation, its effectiveness and its ability to play the role of border guard, or the nation's doorman, in order to halt the introduction of exotics and noxious diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The substantial amount of food which is imported into the country has a quarantine status. Inspection teams from the various state and territory departments of agriculture and the imported food inspection program of AQIS perform this role. The anomaly of the current Imported Food Control Act 1992 is that it only allows officers of AQIS to be appointed as authorised officers to inspect imported food, even though a fully equipped quarantine officer may carry out an inspection of the same food. The proposed amendment simply puts right a glaring problem in the current act. It is a critical problem and on the national scale of importance a problem that must be effectively addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments around the world may be wanting to drag down the tariff walls, to take a sledgehammer to unnecessary and overburdensome protectionism in keynote industries, but the wall that should never be diminished&mdash;indeed only strengthened&mdash;is the wall that has been put up to protect Australia from exotic diseases and the importation of noxious plants, insects and wildlife. The former Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council&mdash;EXANDIS&mdash;outlined in its final report that the greatest threat to Australia is considered to be exotic and highly virulent diseases imported via the backs of migrating birds, on the plastic wrapping of imported products, and in illegally imported products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, AQIS is being given a hard time at the moment, and the inadvertent outbreak of the rabbit calicivirus, the pilchard killings off south&hyphen;east Australia and the papaya fruit fly outbreak has not enhanced its cause. However, any legislative clout that gives AQIS a more effective and efficient inspection service, that minimises unnecessary duplication of services and frees up resources to fight the fight against disease where it needs it the most has to be a step in the right direction. It should be acknowledged that this proposed amendment has been discussed with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), and representatives of the imported food sector and has received a thumbs up all around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under current arrangements, it is not always cost-effective to prosecute passengers and inbound tourists breaching quarantine regulations at Australia's international airports, particularly in cases of less serious breaches. The proposed amendment tied to this legislation in relation to the Quarantine Act 1908 is a practical means of serving penalty notices&mdash;in other words, on&hyphen;the&hyphen;spot fines&mdash;on people detected leaving an airport or port in Australia with undeclared quarantine goods in their possession. This initiative will free up forever our overstretched court system whilst not neglecting the serious breaches against quarantine that occur.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4246">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One case I caught up with in the local press some months ago was that of an individual trying to bring in a giant snail, courtesy of a South American country, as a pet. I understand that this particular breed of snail grows to an astronomical size and, if undetected and let loose on native flora, could have wreaked all sorts of damage. The government is not shirking its task in saying that the quarantine breaches are not serious. On the contrary, introducing a system of penalty notices, or opting for a court hearing for minor breaches, provides cost&hyphen;effectiveness in obtaining compliance with our strict quarantine requirements and, importantly, enhances public awareness of the requirements which escape so many people, from our man with his giant snail in his suitcase to many more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the chicken industry's leading parliamentary fighter against the virulent newcastle disease, I find it noteworthy that exotic disease is not limited just to living plants or to wildlife brought in through the back door. The fact that exotic diseases can be brought in via packaged and processed goods is a source of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another pleasing feature of the legislation, and it should please the people of regional and rural Australia who have done it tough in the past decade and a little bit longer. The recent horrific drought which still, despite healthy rains, has not broken in portions of New South Wales and Queensland, and the dire necessity of drought relief payments, are always a matter of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The classic bumbling by the former Labor government in which farm communities and not dissimilar drought stricken communities or regions were to receive drought relief payments was, of course, an appalling exercise in public relations and yet further evidence of a kick in the guts by Labor to our regions and the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 will strengthen the arrangements that apply to the drought relief payment by clarifying the period of validity for drought exceptional circumstances certificates for the purpose of obtaining drought relief payments. To receive drought relief payments, a requirement to access government money comes in the form of receipt of a current drought exceptional circumstances certificate. These certificates are issued on a six&hyphen;monthly basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current legislation, there is nothing to prevent farmers from saving the DEC certificates and then, at some time in the future, claiming and receiving those DRP retrospectively. The amendments will make this income support payment consistent with other such government outlays which do not provide for entitlements to be paid retrospectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important clarification is the consequential amendments by DEETYA to the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance&mdash;Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1994, which erroneously omits the words `or drought relief payment'. Again, this corrects another case of a classic Labor barb against the people of regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general outline of the legislation also amends the Farm Household Support Act 1992 by exempting income tests applicable to drought relief payments on any proceeds derived from the forced disposal of livestock. Under current arrangements by the former government, farmers receiving drought relief payments who are forced to dispose of their livestock&mdash;a tragic occurrence during times of drought&mdash;are assessed by the Department of Social Security under the DRO test. This is the test that is used as the basis for the estimation of annual income, and it is used to set the rate of the drought relief payment for the next six months.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4247">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just a crazy situation. You cut your stock, and the government potentially cuts your drought relief payments as well. The amendment will exempt from income tests the people of Gloucester, Dungog, Stroud, Bulahdelah&mdash;and indeed, my colleague for Lyne (Mr Vaile), the seat north of mine&mdash;who depend on livestock for their income and survival and who, in tight times, need the drought relief payments to get through. This amendment will ease it for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our government, the Howard government, is absolutely committed to regional and rural Australia. We are determined to make sure that we provide fair and equitable relief to the people in the country. We have to forget all the Labor rhetoric that says that we are cutting services and cutting the guts out from under people in regional and rural Australia. How wrong they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With an improved economy, lower interest rates and support for small businesses&mdash;and one thing that Labor has forgotten is that farms are indeed small businesses&mdash;we are fully supportive of rural and regional Australia. We fully support, too, families in country areas and their need for increased access to things like Medicare. I point out that this is one of the reasons that the Liberal Party holds 31 seats in regional and rural Australia. Indeed, my National Party colleagues hold 18 seats, and the Labor Party, at best, could scratch up two seats. We will accept Tasmania there as a seat. I fully support the bill and I commend the bill to the people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a few points on the amendment of the Farm Household Support Act 1992. The amendments will correct an anomaly in the existing legislation governing the payment of drought relief payments. This was certainly adequately and very eloquently pointed out by the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, for the purposes of drought relief payment, if a farmer is forced to dispose of livestock due to extreme drought conditions, the proceeds from the forced sale are treated as income for the year in which they are received, while in subsequent years they are treated as an asset. This means the proceeds are assessed under the income test for the drought relief payment. The effect of this treatment is that a farmer may be excluded from assistance under the drought relief payment or have his or her entitlement reduced. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following this amendment, all proceeds from the forced disposal of livestock will be excluded from the income test for the purpose of the drought relief payment. This is not only sensible but is a very necessary amendment to the drought relief payment under the Farm Household Support Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many producers who, through extreme drought, have sold off their livestock and have been denied access to drought relief payments. It is important to point out to the committee that the drought relief payment is really an emergency relief payment that is to bring essential food and clothing items into families. There are those who had livestock in the past and had to sell them, through no fault of their own, through the circumstances of the drought, and were denied this. I know this is going to be welcomed by the farming community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just another demonstration that this government understands the needs of those who live in rural and regional Australia. It is also another example of why we are on this side of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4249"> the parliament. Those on the other side clearly did not understand the needs and the unfairness of how this was impacting under the previous drought relief arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking to these amendments, I conclude by saying that I know that many members of the House will be able to advise their communities of this necessary change. It is about putting food on the table, basic clothing and support into the household, and they are very welcome amendments. I table the supplementary explanatory memoranda.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 is a very simple bill. It proposes just one amendment to the principal act. That amendment is to section 20 and it ensures that the act continues to apply for a further two years until 1 January 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 20 of the principal act, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991, is a sunset clause. It currently provides that the act ceases to have effect on 1 January 1997. This bill proposes changing that date to 1 January 1999. Extensive national industry consultations have indicated widespread support for this two&hyphen;year extension of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal act provides assurances of education quality and financial protection to international students studying in Australia. It does so by registering providers of international education and training, based on state or territory approval and accreditation, and by imposing financial conditions on private education providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal act was introduced in 1991 to meet three main objectives, namely: to ensure that international students in Australia are treated with equity and fairness; to provide a positive basis for promoting Australia's international reputation as a provider of reliable high quality education and training; and to ensure that taxpayers' funds are not required to recompense international students who may have been let down by individual education and training providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These objectives remain relevant. This is not just the government's view, but the universal view of industry representatives expressed in recent national consultations by an independent consultant. This is an industry which currently earns Australia $1.9 billion in export revenue annually. It warrants proper protection and this bill allows that protection to continue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4250">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act has included a sunset clause since its making in 1991. The original provision was for a three&hyphen;year sunset period. This was to allow development of complementary state and territory regulation and to ensure that the regulation of many small and medium sized businesses did not continue without review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, states and territories have still not implemented legislation which would allow withdrawal of this act. Following review and extensive debate, the act was strengthened in 1993 and the sunset date was extended by another three years to the current 1 January 1997. Part of this extensive debate was consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, which has now contributed to consideration of this act on several occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with the government's push to limit unnecessary business regulation, it is appropriate to retain a sunset clause in this act. The bill before the Main Committee seeks to extend the sunset date by only two years because this is considered sufficient time to allow further industry consultations and to develop simpler but still effective regulation in this industry. In particular, when the government has had the opportunity to fully consider the report of the current review, it expects to be able to bring forward further amendments to streamline this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry is an important and valuable one for Australia. It is a major part of our growth in the export of services, bringing many intangible benefits, including the development of contacts for future trade and diplomatic links, in addition to the $1.9 billion in export revenue annually. This industry deserves continuing protection. This bill is an important part of such protection. I commend the bill to the Main Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. It extends the existing legislation for a further two years to ensure that there is a degree of financial and quality assurance in the provision of education services to overseas students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation was introduced in response to a situation that developed at the beginning of this decade with regard to the credibility of much that was on offer from the non&hyphen;formal parts of Australia's education and training system; that is, not including the universities, the schools and the TAFE colleges, but the other providers. Some major questions emerged as to the financial viability and the quality of the courses offered by many of those institutions. I think it was universally accepted that a proper regulatory framework had to be put in place and that led to the introduction of this ESOS Act. As has been indicated by Mr Abbott, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, it has been looked at a number of times since and the original sunset clause has been extended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, it is vitally important that we do this to protect what is now a very substantial export industry. There is no doubt that the success of that industry is very sensitive to the credibility and the reputation for quality of what is provided by Australian providers of education and training services, and that has to be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The precise nature of the regulatory framework is a matter that one can debate. The previous government initiated a review, carried out by Ernst and Young, of the operation of the legislation. That review involved very extensive consultations with all the stakeholders, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4251"> including the industry and the various tiers of government. I do not think there is any great dissent from the broad thrust of what emerged from that review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review canvassed a number of possible regulatory models, including the Commonwealth having the predominant role, or giving it to the states and territories, or having some sort of self&hyphen;regulatory arrangement with the industry. There was something approaching unanimity, I gather, that the right approach would be a cooperative regulatory scheme involving the Commonwealth and state and territory governments together with the industry. There was no great dissent from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review also recommended the extension of the sunset clause for the existing legislation for a further two years. That is what the legislation we are dealing with today does, the idea being to provide a further period to enable the development of a more streamlined and simplified scheme of regulation. The opposition has no problem with that whatsoever, so that is all I will say.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the collapse in the late 1980s of several private education providers who had offered services to overseas students&mdash;particularly from the Republic of China&mdash;and who had accepted a deposit payment of full fees, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act was passed in 1991. Specifically, the government was forced to refund the fees of more than 12,000 international students in 1989 who were affected by the closure of private educational services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously this was embarrassing for everyone concerned and the principal bill was an attempt to ensure that this situation was not repeated. The principal act has since successfully given greater protection for overseas students, principally through the provision that education providers be registered, and fees paid by overseas students be placed into trust funds that may only be accessed in accordance with the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 20 of the act provides a sunset clause up to the beginning of January 1997. The purpose of this bill is to extend this sunset clause to 1 January 1999. The government has stated that, in this time, it is hoped that the industry will, in consultation with the government, be able to develop simpler and more effective self&hyphen;regulation. These are necessary and somewhat inevitable developments within an industry still in the maturing process. Australia's history in the overseas higher education sector began in the 1950s with Australia becoming an active participant in the Colombo Plan. This country initially provided 150 scholarships to students mainly from Commonwealth countries, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beginning with the University of Melbourne, Monash University and the University of New South Wales, strategies were developed in the 1960s for universities to become more accessible to overseas students. In 1969, these initiatives culminated in the Australian vice&hyphen;chancellors forming the Australian&hyphen;Asian universities cooperation scheme to strengthen research and teaching exchanges with foreign higher education facilities. After a further series of debates about the future of higher education provision during the 1970s and early 1980s, the Jackson report in 1984 concluded that the internationalisation of Australia's higher education should be encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This groundbreaking report stated that the higher education sector in this country needed to be more accessible for overseas students because `discouraging the entry of foreign students harms Australia's foreign relations, deprives the community of cultural contacts, and neglects a potential source of export earnings'. By 1988, every Australian education sector was aggressively competing for overseas students and, after some initial hiccups, consumer <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4252"> protection was extended to the growing number of overseas students in the form of the principal act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to inform the committee of the many benefits, apart from the immediate moneys received from fees, that overseas students bring to Australia, benefits which will only be enhanced as this industry develops, grows and matures. As I have already said, following the recommendations of the 1984 Jackson report, education facilities in Australia opened their doors to overseas fee paying students. Since 1986, the number of fee paying students in Australia has increased from 2,000 to around 81,000 in 1995. By far the greatest increase has come from the Asian region. Of the 70,000 students in 1994, 55,000 came from Asia. In 1994, 16.5 per cent of overseas students came from the People's Republic of China; 11.9 per cent, from Malaysia; 10.7 per cent, from Indonesia; and a further 9.5 per cent, from Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a negligible amount of revenue received from fees from overseas students, the figure has grown and now stands at between $300 million and $400 million per year. Estimates for total net expenditure of overseas students in 1991&hyphen;92 in Australia ranged from $800 million to $1.2 billion per year. The total spending in 1994 of overseas students on course fees and stationery items alone amounted to well over $700 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overseas students also, according to the Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research, increase the aggregate demand for labour here in Australia by between 0.4 and 0.7 per cent. This so&hyphen;called `quasi export income' results from the expenditure of overseas students on locally produced goods and services. I might add at this stage that overseas students do not displace Australian students, nor are they subsidised. Unlike in the mid&hyphen;1980s, the overseas student industry has become trade rather than aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1992 survey of international students, it was estimated that the average overseas student spends about $422 per week whilst in Australia. This can only be good for small business everywhere. The average student from Japan spends 48 weeks of the year in Australia studying, spending an annual total of $26,683. Apart from the education expenditure that overseas students outlay on other goods and services whilst here in Australia, they pay taxes and contribute to research and teaching and the internationalisation of business and training; they encourage future trade opportunities; they add to the cultural, social and political tapestry; they benefit post&hyphen;study immigration; and, importantly, they promote tourism by their friends and families, not only for the time that they are here but for many years after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overseas students do not harm local employment. Even if working rights are granted to overseas students, there remains a substantial net gain to local employment. The effect on employment levels within the higher education sector has naturally been the most dramatic, both in regards to academics and their support staff. There has been a fivefold increase over the period 1989 to 1995 of staff employed as a direct result of the presence of overseas students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The presence of foreign students in our educational facilities also enables the higher education sector in Australia to be more effective in an increasingly international environment. Whilst rapid increases in technology, such as the Internet, have ensured a vigorous exchange of ideas and dialogue between students in different countries, nothing will ever compare with the physical exchange of students and the enriching experience they gain from spending study and recreational time in other countries.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4253">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a world where most industries are evolving a more international focus, the interaction of Australian and international students can only be seen as a good thing. In the fields of medicine, engineering, economics and development, to name just a few, the personal relationships begun here in Australia often lead to healthy and beneficial relationships of a business and humanitarian nature in the future. This promotes understanding, tolerance and mutual respect. Many of those studying here will become the leaders of tomorrow, especially in the Asian region. It benefits our objectives and national interests to understand and be better understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we cannot underestimate just how competitive this industry is. America leads the way with 400,000 overseas students, followed by France with 125,000. Germany and Australia are roughly on equal terms with about 80,000 students. In recent years both Germany and France have attempted to restrict the future of growth in overseas student numbers, thereby presenting to Australia an opportunity to increase its share in this expanding market. Japan, however, has recently indicated its commitment to internationalising education and has plans for 100,000 students by the turn of the century. Australia therefore has to remain committed to providing quality education that guarantees that overseas students get what they paid for. This bill will go a long way in ensuring that this happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In detail, the principal bill requires accreditation for both the courses and institutions, which must remain proper in their recruitment of overseas students and must maintain notified trust accounts to be audited by DEETYA. The education providers must deposit all prepaid course money, refund fees if the institution closes and provide alternative arrangements in such a case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has recently commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The partnership between education providers and the government ensures high quality student services through the combination of effective industry self&hyphen;regulation and a legislative safety net.</PARA>
<PARA>The government&hyphen;industry partnership in international education is now pursued directly through the Australian International Education Foundation, which provides support and continuous improvement. The Minister for Education has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian government is looking to a genuine and equal partnership with the education industry and to a commitment to continuous improvement of Australia's performance to ensure consistent achievement of international commercial best practice.</PARA>
<PARA>This act goes a long way in consolidating this relationship and coordinating private and public sector ambitions in the area of higher education provision to overseas students in the immediate future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the ongoing protection for overseas students is a vital component to Australia remaining a popular choice for students, especially in the South&hyphen;East Asia region. The international competition between Australia and North America will only increase in the future and it is important that these safeguards remain until the industry is mature enough for self&hyphen;regulation and stability. The extension of the act's sunset clause is a judicious decision until this time. I commend the bill to the Main Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, the main intent of which is to postpone the sunset clause in the principal act from having effect until 1 January 1999. The principal legislation was enacted following <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4254"> disturbing events involving overseas students who had paid up&hyphen;front fees for training courses and were left in the lurch when private providers failed to honour their obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991 sought to achieve three main objectives: to ensure international students in Australia were fairly treated; to ensure Australia maintained its international reputation as a reliable provider of high quality education and training; and to ensure that Australian taxpayers were not again required to compensate for broken commitments of service providers. In short, the act provided an essential framework of protection for overseas students studying in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that, since the passage of the Commonwealth act several years ago, complementary legislation has not been enacted in the states and territories. Consequently, the federal government has found it necessary to extend the sunset clause provision. In Queensland's case, it is a glaring indictment of the former Goss Labor government that it procrastinated and neglected this relatively simple task for years. I am glad to see that the current Queensland Minister for Education, Mr Bob Quinn, is taking the appropriate steps to alleviate this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extension of the sunset clause provision will enable governments, in consultation with industry, to devise a coherent regulatory scheme that will provide effective protection to overseas students. The legislation will also be in keeping with the federal government's initiatives against unnecessary red tape that needlessly hampers this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of this task should not be underestimated. The provision of education and training services to fee&hyphen;paying overseas students has been one of the quiet success stories of recent times, the magnitude of which still goes largely unrecognised. Australia's reputation in these overseas countries has been a pivotal element in Australia's past success, and is essential to the future expansion of the industry. In many ways it is astonishing to realise that, from its beginnings as a foreign aid scheme under the Colombo Plan, the provision of educational services to overseas students by Australian institutions and other providers has transformed into an industry which now earns Australia $1.9 billion annually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The magnitude of this industry&mdash;for that is what it is&mdash;cannot be underestimated when institutions such as the University of Queensland can claim to be amongst Australia's top 500 exporters. The University of Queensland aims to have international students constituting five per cent of all enrolments, and when one looks at the facts it is not hard to see why this is a desirable outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be remembered that overseas students are enrolled over and above the course quotas for Australian students. They do not deny any Australian student a place at university. In purely economic terms, overseas students contribute enormously both to the economy and to the particular institutions they attend. The course fees paid contribute direct income to universities which decreases their reliance on government funding and helps the universities to stand on their own feet in this tight fiscal climate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 fee&hyphen;paying undergraduate students from overseas comprised 2.3 per cent of the total undergraduate enrolments at the University of Queensland, but they contributed $6.6 million in income. Fee&hyphen;paying postgraduate students comprised 10.6 per cent of total postgraduate enrolments and contributed $8.1 million. Universities are not, however, the sole providers of educational services in this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4255">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A prime example of a training provider set to earn export income for Australia is the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre. The centre will be based in my electorate of Lilley and, as the federal member, I have a keen interest in its success. Lilley has the benefit of being the undisputed racing capital of Queensland. Within Lilley's boundaries fall most of south&hyphen;east Queensland's major race tracks, including Eagle Farm, Doomben, Albion Park and the Deagon training track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost 1,000 thoroughbred horses are trained in the electorate, and the suburbs of Hendra, Hamilton and Ascot provide the traditional base for the stabling of horses in south&hyphen;east Queensland. The Queensland Turf Club at Eagle Farm and the Brisbane Turf Club at Doomben have a total membership of about 4,000 people. Consequently, it is fair to say that the success of the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre is of vital importance to the economic wellbeing of Lilley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre's one&hyphen;year course is specifically designed for international students who want a career in the Australian racing and breeding industry. Students will study in Brisbane and at the University of Queensland's Gatton campus. While the course is nationally accredited, it is only available in Queensland. Features of the course include a specially designed English language program. Opportunities to specialise in specific areas of the racing industry, such as track riding, race riding and stud management, are also available. Students will exit the course with a vocational certificate at ASF level II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill cannot be underestimated in the case of the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre. The first intake of 56 Japanese students in January this year has been very successful. These students have already contributed almost $2 million to our economy, by way of fees and accommodation, and they help reduce the cost of the training to our own students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill should assist the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre to market its courses in Asia and future students will be excellent advocates for promoting our racing industry. It is estimated that within the next five to 10 years at least 10 new racetracks will be open in China alone. This will require the purchase of more than 10,000 horses and expanded infrastructure in a country with no racing expertise. We therefore have the opportunity to educate people who will eventually become influential in the South&hyphen;East Asian, Chinese and Japanese racing industries. This strong network can only benefit the Australian industry in terms of racing, breeding and tourism. Already, 50 per cent of the students are indicating they would like to study advanced courses in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the development of our integrated racing training complex in south&hyphen;east Queensland, with the support of the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre, would be an excellent platform for the Australian racing industry to seek further markets in South&hyphen;East Asia. I have no hesitation in supporting the bill, as the importance of our engagement with overseas students should be fostered and, above all, their interests protected. Through this interaction, the educational lives of both Australians and overseas students may be enriched and Australia may earn significant export dollars in return.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes, I have received a copy of SST6 from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). This public ruling is not a change of Government policy. The ATO in conjunction with professional bodies and taxpayer representatives has developed a comprehensive ruling to assist taxpayers to determine the taxable value of the goods they sell. The ruling deals with and provides solutions for issues affecting the calculation of taxable value of goods which is a major building block in the sales tax law. The ruling seeks to assist taxpayers by explaining the practical application of Government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Next to the difficulties experienced in correctly classifying goods for sales tax purposes, determining the taxable value of goods is the most common and time consuming problem faced by both the ATO and taxpayers. For this reason publishing a public taxation ruling on taxable value was considered to be of some priority by the ATO, sales tax practitioners and large corporate taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) This ruling is the result of intensive negotiations over the last 2 years with sales tax professional bodies, industry bodies and the ATO. It provides certainty and consistency through the use of Safe Harbours that can be adopted by taxpayers. These are practical guidelines to help make taxable value calculations easier and will provide clarity for taxpayers to self assess their sales tax dealings. While safe harbours are not mandatory, if taxpayers <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> apply them and pay sales tax at the correct rate they will have met their sales tax liability for that transaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ruling provides simplified methods of calculating taxable value and may reduce the cost of compliance for taxpayers who choose that option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conjunction with the professional bodies and the Corporate Taxpayers Association, the ATO has included processes in the ruling to manage the impact of the withdrawal of previous rulings and to give taxpayers time to consider their position. If a previous ruling conflicts with the principles in the new public ruling, it will be altered from 1 October 1996 giving taxpayers time to consider their position and to approach the ATO if their circumstances are not adequately dealt with in the ruling. If there is no conflict of principles, all private rulings issued after 30 June 1992 will cease to be effective 5 years from their date of issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date the ruling has been very well received by both the practitioners and taxpayers and there have been a number of positive reports in the media.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's response to the Industry Commission's report was announced in my Press Release of 3 May 1996. In that response, I noted that the Commonwealth would raise in the Council of Australian Governments' Committee on Regulatory Reform those recommendations of the Commission that fall within the jurisdiction of the States and Territories. The question of compulsory third party property damage is one such issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government generally supports the Industry Commission recommendation that State and Territory Governments should not introduce a compulsory third party property damage insurance scheme in any form that limits insurers' underwriting flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any government imposed limitation on the underwriting discretion of insurers (for example, to mandate coverage and/or premium rates) could <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4266"> have an adverse impact on insurers' solvency and their capacity to pay claims. This may discourage insurers from participating in the vehicle insurance market and reduce the level of competition which acts to keep premiums to a minimum. Alternatively, insurers might seek government guarantees against adverse outcomes flowing from any limitations imposed on their underwriting discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am informed that the Insurance Council of Australia's campaign in South Australia was not a direct response to the Industry Commission's report, but to local circumstances and that it was wholly funded by the insurance industry.
