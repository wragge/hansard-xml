<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill represents a significant milestone for the very troubled Australian wool industry. It is the culmination of a period of very extensive consultation and the development of very considerable cooperation&mdash;which came out of that consultation&mdash;within the industry and clearly demonstrates that the industry can come together on issues of critical importance to its future. It reflects a willingness on the part of the industry to work together that I hope will remain a feature of the industry for many years to come, particularly as it grapples with the need to find strategies and directions to secure a realistic living for the people in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This government has worked alongside the industry during a very difficult period to help reach the consensus approach to the package of measures reflected in this bill. It is a mark of the level of cooperation and the recognition of the need for a consensus which brought the industry and government together to resolve this issue at the successful 30 August round table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1">  This bill represents the final stage in the disposal of the wool stockpile which was created during the last years of the reserve price scheme. The stockpile and the associated  debt are both now at a level which is less than half that which had built up in the early 1990s. To a very large extent&mdash;this is, unfortunately, often overlooked in the understand able hurt and emotion of the moment&mdash;this is a tribute to the fixed release schedule which has operated since 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government supported the implementation of the fixed release schedule on the basis that it presented a sound mechanism for disposing of the stockpile and removing the detrimental effect it was having at that time on the entire wool market. Only through the success of this arrangement has the industry been given the opportunity to review and recommend change to the disposal schedule to enable Wool International, as the stockpile manager, to exercise greater commercial flexibility and responsiveness in the interests of the overall wool market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for a package of measures which will see the stockpile finally cleared by 31 December 2000. The package broadens considerably the range within which Wool International is required to sell stockpile wool each quarter. The quarterly minimum disposal requirement is reduced from its current level of 182,000 bales per quarter&mdash;first to 135,000 bales per quarter from 1 January 1997 to June 1993, then reducing to 90,000 bales per quarter from 1 July 1997. The quarterly maximum disposal requirement is increased from 192,000 bales per quarter to 350,000 bales per quarter from 1 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The intention of broadening the disposal range is to provide Wool International with considerably greater commercial flexibility to sell more in a rising market and sell less in a softer market. The expectation is that this will ease the pressure on the fresh wool market at more critical periods in the wool market cycle. I think we would all acknowledge now that, whilst the focus when Wool International was put in place was very much on debt and on the need to recover as much of that debt as possible, it was appropriate at that time to concentrate on and to recognise in Wool International's charter&mdash;through the legislation that put it in place&mdash;the need to maximise the value of the stockpile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt now, however, that the urgent priority is to maximise returns to growers in their current very difficult circumstances after some five or six years of wool prices being essentially below the cost of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> production. It has done immense damage in much of rural Australia. We need to remember that there are vast slabs of this country where the only really viable agricultural pursuit is wool growing. Those entire areas are tragically at very real risk at the moment, with run-down properties, dispirited landowners, towns falling apart, small businesses collapsing and the very infrastructure of communities starting to unravel&mdash;a truly tragic picture. The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who is in the chamber, would know only too well of what is happening in his area and in many of the towns and communities in western New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the expectation is that the new approach will ease the pressure on the fresh wool market at critical times in the wool market cycle. I point out, on the flip side of the coin&mdash;this needs to be kept clearly in mind&mdash;that the Wool International Board will need to balance the exercise of this new greater commercial flexibility against three other new elements. First, as a means of ensuring a steady retirement of debt, a target date of 31 December 1998 has been set for the final repayment of the debt. Once this has been achieved, the government's debt guarantee arrangements will also end. This underlines the government's view that it needs to continue to withdraw from the industry to allow the industry to determine its future direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> That is not to say that we will not work with the industry in the future to achieve the best possible results for it. In broad terms, we are determined as a government to create the best possible economic environment for the industry to operate in with the lowest possible costs, inflation and interest rates. Those sorts of things that have done so much damage to rural Australia in the past will be squarely tackled, as has been made plain in this place on many occasions by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are committed to more flexible industrial relations. It needs to be remembered that the Garnaut report identified very considerable savings for wool growers through more efficient handling, storage and waterfront arrangements in particular, and we need to pursue those. I see a very important role for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6092"> government in the area of research and development, and we will continue to contribute very significantly in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also see a very important role for government in assisting with trade negotiations and market access negotiations. The pursuit of these sorts of initiatives is reflected by the recent signing of a wool cooperation agreement between Tim Fischer, as Minister for Trade, and Dr Herminio Blanco, the Mexican Minister for Trade and Industrial Development, in which I participated. Under this agreement, wool tops from this country will be exported to Mexico with no tariffs being applied along the way. Our tops, with Australian expertise and skills being used in the process, will be value added in Mexico and then re-exported as finished garments into North America&mdash;again, under NAFTA on a tariff free basis. The government has a major role to play in that sort of enlightened approach as we seek to secure for the industry that which it needs most&mdash;and I use those terms advisedly&mdash;and that is a very significant opening up in market opportunities. If the wool industry is to have a future, it really must, together with government, now focus on the vital prerequisite&mdash;the key to that future&mdash;which is boosting demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hear a lot of growers complaining about the performance of those who seek to promote their product; yet it is not all bad news. Just by way of example, since the first major shake&hyphen;out of the IWS in the late 1980s when the reserve price scheme collapsed, the leaned down and much trimmer IWS, with its more carefully targeted programs, has managed not only to halt the erosion of wool share of the apparel markets in our six major customer nations but also to turn that around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very unfortunate indeed. I cannot work out why wool prices are not recovering more strongly now, because the pipeline is freeing up, and both the on-farm stockpile and the in&hyphen;warehouse stockpile is easing. The signs are there that supply and demand ought to be coming back into a healthier balance. It does concern me that we are not seeing the pick-up that one might have expected out of that relatively happy coincidence of events.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is regrettable that fibre markets right across the globe are very flat at the moment. The cotton industry is experiencing the same thing; so is the synthetics industry. In part, and this needs to be kept in mind by wool growers, it reflects the fact that there are so many things now competing for the consumer's dollar. Consumers may decide they are going to buy new clothes; they might equally decide they are going to buy some new computer equipment for the kids; or they may decide that, instead of buying a couple of sweaters during the winter, they are going buy one of a higher quality and keep it longer. Changing consumer patterns are very much part of what is happening to the wool market internationally. That needs to be addressed. It needs to be tackled. We need to find innovative ways to operate and to promote the product in that changed environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other thing that concerns me enormously is that, some five or six years ago, research undertaken by the International Wool Secretariat showed, quite plainly, that under-35s in most major Western consuming nations had a very low awareness of the qualities of wool. I suppose in general terms it could be summarised by saying that they thought of it as a natural product. They also thought that wool was expensive, hard to look after, and in general knew very little about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am alarmed to see some more recent work that shows five years down the road it is the under-40s who have no particular appreciation of the qualities of wool; in other words, we are not managing to break that age barrier. In another five years, if we are not careful, it will be the under&hyphen;45s and in 10 years time it will be the under&hyphen;50s. Then we really will be looking at a very small market indeed if we cannot get younger people more switched on to the qualities and the desirability of wool as a fibre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The second point that needs to be kept in mind in terms of new parameters is that Wool International will be required to have sold and delivered the last bale in the stockpile by an end date of 31 December 2000. This is included to ensure that the overhang effects of the stockpile on the wool market can be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6093"> removed at the earliest possible time, taking account of the many other factors in the market. It is also included to ensure that Wool International and the government's involvement in the statutory authority can be wound up within a reasonable time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Of course, there may well be an opportunity&mdash;and I for one sincerely hope there is&mdash;for Wool International to clear the debt and the stockpile well in advance of these legislated dates. This would be entirely consistent with the government's objective of an early withdrawal from direct involvement in issues that are clearly matters for the industry and for the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Finally, but very significantly, Wool International's objectives have been changed in two ways in order to add a new factor which the Wool International board must take into account in determining the rate of stockpile disposal at any particular time in the future. The requirement for Wool International to foster the long-term profitability and efficiency of the Australian wool industry has been amended to remove the phrase `long&hyphen;term'. This reflects the increasing need, as the stockpile runs down, of Wool International to foster the short, medium and long term profitability of the industry to the greatest extent possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In addition, Wool International is to be required, in providing for the disposal and management of the wool stockpile and in addition to enhancing the ultimate value of the stockpile, to take account of the effect of the disposal of stockpile wool on the Australian wool market. This requirement is repeated in Wool International's functions so as to ensure that there is no doubt as to its importance in the disposal program. As a result, I expect Wool International to review its sales program and, in reaching the decision it makes on a day-by-day basis on the level of sales, to be continuously addressing the issue of the impact of those sales on the wool market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had some time in Western Australia last week and I am deeply conscious of the discussions I had there. On one occasion I had a rather interesting and spirited discussion with a large group of growers who were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concerned about the impact on the price of fresh wool of Wool International's selling approaches. I undertook with them in good faith to look at this matter very closely and, in particular, to address their proposition that all the wool out of the stockpile ought to be sold at auction. I will shortly be announcing details as to how we will participate in a review and make some decisions in relation to that matter, although I make it quite plain that we will be looking for the best outcome for growers, recognising their need for price relief at the earliest instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, this package is the culmination of a very intense and widespread consultative process. It is a very clear signal that the Australian wool industry is prepared to set its own course and determine its own destiny without relying on government for support. When I came into this portfolio the view that I formed was that the industry was not only dispirited, it was badly divided. There were major problems confronting the wool industry and there were debates at that time over whether the major problem was the stockpile, the way the stockpile was being disposed of or lack of demand. I formed the view that in one sense the greatest problem of all confronting the industry was division because without unity they had no hope of tackling those other problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My energies have been devoted towards drawing this industry together, getting them communicating and focusing on the need to speak with one voice, and getting them switched on to the fact that their real competitors&mdash;those with whom they need to argue and establish a point of view or a dominance with&mdash;are not other sectors of their own industry but their competitors; and their competitors are cotton and synthetic fibres. The industry need to be very conscious of that as we grapple for a future for this vitally important Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen in recent times is a very encouraging sign of the industry's increasing maturity as it forges ahead. Representatives of the industry, including AWRAP and the Wool Council, will be consulting widely on the other issues that are of importance and that were discussed at the wool round tables, such <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6094"> as promotion and the need to address not only the nature of how we are going to target promotion and what we are going to do to increase people's awareness of wool, but also how we are going to fund it. At the moment, on the back of lower wool prices, the level of funding for the wool industry's promotion objectives and campaigns is running at quite a low level, around $130 million globally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you compare that with the sort of money that such people as Coca&hyphen;Cola spend on maintaining demand for their product, $130 million for such a vitally important product worth many billions of dollars annually to the Australian economy is not a lot of money. But finding extra money in the current hard&hyphen;pressed conditions that growers find themselves in is not easy. The problem with nearly all the options for increased funding that this government and the previous government have participated in trying to identify is that ultimately it nearly all ends up coming out of growers' pockets anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That will be a difficult debate but I do encourage growers to participate in an increased promotion effort, carefully targeted perhaps with an attempt to be as innovative as possible and recognising the very different parameters that confront the industry as it seeks to promote its product in the modern marketplace. Recognising all of those things, I am sure a more effective approach can be adopted in the future&mdash;that is not to take anything away from those who are currently seeking to direct promotion at the moment. On that basis, it is with great pleasure that I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill is part of a package relating to charging for telecommunications numbers. The second part of this package is the Telecommunications Amendment Bill, which I will deal with shortly. This bill is about the government delivering on its promises to deliver a fair and equitable environment for the telecommunications industry. The bill enables the Commonwealth to charge for certain numbers used for the delivery of telecommunications services. These numbers are a limited public resource.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current arrangements, carriers and service providers do not pay for the numbers allocated to them by Austel, the government regulator. I am informed that the carriers do charge users for some of these numbers. A price based allocation system for numbers will remove the windfall gains which the carriers currently enjoy, and will also encourage an efficient allocation of this limited resource. I expect that charging for number allocations would encourage the carriers to rationalise some of their holdings, including returning numbers held in carrier and service provider inventories. These numbers would thus be freed for use by new market entrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's scheme, as reflected in the bill, will provide the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">carriers and service providers will be charged for the allocation of blocks of numbers they receive from Austel;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">charges will be levied annually;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">Austel is to set the level of fees for different number ranges by determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Austel determination, which will specify the numbers to attract a charge and the level of the charge, will be a disallowable instrument. The parliament will therefore have the opportunity to examine the administrative details of the scheme. I expect the charging scheme to derive in the vicinity of $30 million in Commonwealth revenue. I am advised that, to meet this figure, the charge on some numbers could be as low as $1.00.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6095">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Communications and the Arts can issue a direction to Austel under section 50 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 prohibiting Austel from levying charges on certain numbers. It is important to note that the minister will issue a direction which will prevent charges from being imposed on telephone numbers which are allocated for the provision of the standard telephone service&mdash;that is, `basic' telephone numbers for both residential and business users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is envisaged that the highest charges&mdash;with a maximum limit of $100,000&mdash;will be imposed on certain premium numbers, including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">`13' six&hyphen;digit and `134' eight&hyphen;digit numbers used for special network services</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">`1800' 10&hyphen;digit numbers, which are reserved for free phone services</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">`190' 10&hyphen;digit numbers for information services, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">`005' nine&hyphen;digit numbers, also used for information services.</PARA>
<PARA>Charges would therefore be applied to a maximum of six million numbers in relation to these premium ranges. Charges will not be set on numbers allocated for the standard telephone service. Certain blocks could reasonably be considered to hold more intrinsic value than others. The specific charges to be applied to specific blocks of numbers will be considered by Austel in consultation with the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Act 1991 does not permit fees being applied to numbers that have already been allocated free of charge. The existing legislation also does not allow annual charges, which are appropriate for a public resource where we do not wish to grant long&hyphen;term ownership rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The bill I am now presenting to the parliament enables the accomplishment of the proposed charging scheme. It will enable efficient management and allocation of a valuable national resource. It will also provide for charges to be levied on numbers which have already been allocated to carriers, thus ensuring that carriers will not be unfairly advantaged over other market players. Fur thermore, the bill will ensure that at least some of the value of this resource is recovered by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A separate bill will be introduced to the House as part of the post&hyphen;1997 telecommunications regulatory environment to ensure the number charging scheme continues after the deregulation of the industry on 1 July 1997. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>Part 1 of the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1996 relates to disclosure of information to emergency services. Part 2 relates to charging for telecommunications numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to charging for telecommunications numbers, this bill comprises the second part of a package of legislative amendments. I have provided details of the proposed charging scheme for telecommunications numbers in my second reading speech for the Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Amendment Bill 1996. This bill adds to the scheme by providing for the collection of numbering charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of part 1 of the Telecommunications Amendment Bill is to clarify the exemptions from prosecution, which are provided for disclosure by employees of telecommunications carriers or eligible service providers of customer information to operators of emergency services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under paragraph 88(3)(d) of the Telecommunications Act 1991, information obtained by a carrier or service provider employee <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6096"> about the name, telephone number, address or location of callers to the emergency number 000, or information about the content of such calls may be disclosed to police, fire or ambulance officers. Information may not be disclosed where calls are to other emergency numbers allocated by Austel nor disclosed to persons performing services on behalf of the emergency services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austel has specified in the national numbering plan an alternative emergency number `112' for callers using digital mobile services, and there is a proposal for another emergency number to be specified by Austel for access by hearing and speech impaired persons to emergency services using teletypewriter equipment via the national relay service. The amendments will enable the specified information about callers or calls to emergency services to be disclosed on all emergency numbers identified by Austel in the national numbering plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will allow information to be disclosed to an emergency service contractor rather than to the emergency services directly. It seems that in at least one state there is a proposal for emergency services to outsource call taking and dispatch functions. These amendments do not in any way alter the obligation of carriers to provide free access to an emergency number. The government will ensure that this obligation continues in the post&hyphen;1997 telecommunications environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will facilitate quick responses by emergency services to calls to emergency services, while ensuring that the confidentiality of personal customer information continues to be protected. The office of the Privacy Commissioner has raised no objections to the amendments other than to comment that they should be accompanied by an appropriate public education campaign to ensure that callers to the emergency number are aware of the information that may be disclosed and in what circumstances. The government will ensure that such a campaign takes place. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in a rather difficult position, because I had been hoping that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), who was in the chamber just a few minutes ago, would be present for this debate. I shall assist the House by responding to a couple of matters that were raised by the minister in his response to the second reading and, in particular, his criticisms of some of the Labor speakers in the debate for accusing the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government of wanting to wind back Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The view I have put is that this government and this minister in some ways are putting the Medicare salami on the delicatessen slicer. As each budget comes along, as this minister rolls in each piece of legislation, this government slices off another piece of the Medicare salami. Freezing the rebate for general practitioners is one slice of the salami. An $800 million cutback in funding for public hospitals is another slice off the Medicare salami. Other increases in the cost of expensive operations also have an impact on Medicare and ultimately on the services that are provided to the Australian people who rely on Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that I have only three minutes left and there are a number of issues that I would like to raise, perhaps I can put  them to the minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran), and he might consider responding to them after advice from the advisers in the advisers' box.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue that we were discussing when the debate was interrupted on the last occasion was whether or not the government or the minister had given assurances to any member or senator that Medicare offices in their own electorates would be closed or kept open. The minister made the following remarks in response to my question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that what I had actually said was that I had not made a decision about which offices were to close. That does not mean that I have not made a decision as to which offices might stay open. The two do not necessarily follow.</PARA>
<PARA>If the minister was telling us that he has in fact made some decisions about which offices will stay open, I would like to ask the minister at the table to please tell us which offices the government has decided will remain open. In particular, given that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and even the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) have claimed that the Penrith, Richmond, Windsor and, I think, a few other offices in that electorate are to remain open, can the minister confirm that decisions have been made to keep open all of the Medicare offices?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6098">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another electorate, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) in media on the Central Coast has claimed that the Medicare offices at Umina and Erina are to remain open and he claimed that he had an assurance from the minister that that was the case. I would like the minister to advise me today before I go on to additional comments whether or not that is the case. He might like to consult the advisers in the box.</PARA>

I hope he can respond to those questions so that we in this House can find out whether or not some members of the House of Representatives are lucky enough to know that their Medicare offices are to be kept open. We would like to know whether or not Labor members of parliament are having their Medicare offices targeted as some form of political discrimination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, I think this parliament has received more petitions from more constituents about the Medicare office in The Entrance in my own electorate than about any other Medicare office in Australia, as a result of the volunteer efforts of members of The Entrance&hyphen;Long Jetty Combined Pensioners Association. Since I have been unable to get an assurance that the Medicare office at The Entrance will remain open, I would like to ask the minister at the table: if I cannot receive that assurance about the Medicare office at The Entrance, have assurances been given to other members, such as the member for Lindsay, such as the Prime Minister, such as the Treasurer and such as the member for Robertson?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not attempt to speak entirely on behalf of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) on this matter except to say that I can reassure the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) that decisions regarding the future of Medicare offices will not be made on political grounds. Instead, there is a full, complete, thorough and proper review under way at present to assess their effectiveness, where proper savings can be identified and so on. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is obvious that some Medicare offices are necessary because of the population they serve. Members on this side of the House, as indeed on your own side, are entitled to be fairly confident in their predictions about which Medicare offices will be retained. Others we can be less sure of. For instance, in my rural electorate of Gippsland there are issues of population to be taken into account in considering whether or not all of the offices remain open. But what is very reassuring for members in rural electorates like mine is the government's initiative of establishing Medicare branches or agencies or facilities in pharmacies. So I have been able to tell the good voters of Gippsland that they will still have this direct access to Medicare. The pharmacies in my electorate are very interested and, indeed, excited by the potential of their being part of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in summary, as I am sure the minister for health will tell us, he is not going to pre-empt in some piecemeal fashion the review of Medicare offices under way. It is high time that was done. It is necessary. There are shifts in population, shifts in degrees of services as well as the opportunity to use pharmacies for Medicare services. It is a wonder it was not done, frankly, during your term in government. This is no Ros Kelly type of whiteboard exercise where you favour your political mates and punish your political opponents. This is a wholly transparent, thorough, needed and credible exercise. And bear in mind that pharmacies will be open for business for Medicare in a way they have never been before.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I discussed this yesterday evening. Really, nothing has changed since yesterday evening. No firm decisions have been made about closure, although there are a small number of Medicare offices which now have such a very low throughput of claims that it is standing out fairly starkly that it is hard to justify their existence. Some Medicare offices have a large volume of claims that are stable and do not have close proximity to another office, so it is patently obvious they are going to stay open. And there is the overwhelming majority in the middle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So while no firm decision has been made on any office, I have indicated to one of my colleagues that there is some likelihood that some offices in this electorate will close. I have said to the odd colleague, I am sure, over the last couple of months that, given the nature of a certain office, it is likely that it would stay open. But that is an absolute minority of cases. There is a process independent of me and independent of the political processes looking at things objectively by an objective set of criteria.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will follow your counsel. Perhaps I could summarise the other points that I think are important for considering the matters before the House at the moment. The minister has advised the House this morning that some of his colleagues have been lucky enough to have been informed that their Medicare offices will remain open. Yet in the Senate estimates hearing a Ms Wood from the Health Insurance Commission on 21 October, which is not that long ago&mdash;if I have my numbers right it is only about eight or nine days ago&mdash;was asked what criteria would be used to determine which offices would remain open and which would close. She was asked about the consideration of which Medicare offices would remain open and which would remain closed. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is why I am still unable to give you final criteria, because it is not finalised.</PARA>
<PARA>So Ms Wood is indicating quite clearly that the criteria for determining which offices remain open or closed have not yet been finalised. That was nine days ago. Yet, minister, apparently you have been able to assure some of your colleagues, irrespective of the criteria being determined, that certain Medicare offices will remain open. I am sure that a number of my colleagues would also like to have the benefit of being told that their Medicare offices could remain open, irrespective of the criteria to be used in that assessment not yet being finalised. I ask the minister to advise the House whether or not these criteria have been finalised and, if they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6100"> have not, how the minister is able to determine which offices remain open or closed if the Health Insurance Commission does not know the criteria to be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will the minister also confirm the information given to the Senate estimates committee that 35 Medicare offices will close this year and that that number will increase to 51 next year, 68 the year after, to a total of 84 three years from now. If that is the case, minister, don't you think you should have been honest enough to have admitted that Medicare offices with a substantial turnover are going to be affected by your decision in this budget to close one&hyphen;third of all Medicare offices?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to pick up another point made by the minister, that is, the claim that these new pharmacy agencies will be in some way a replacement for the closed Medicare offices. Could the minister please advise us what equipment will be fitted out in the pharmacies that are lucky enough to be chosen as agencies? One of the budget papers claimed that a fax machine would be used in the pharmacy agencies that acted on behalf of the government. Does that government document still apply or has there been some change? Will it be a fax machine or some form of computer? To what extent will pharmacy staff be required to assist claimants to lodge their claims, or will this be one of those do&hyphen;it&hyphen;yourself Medicare offices where you fax off your Medicare claim to some central point? I would be grateful for some clarification of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night the minister said that a number of options were being considered as to what would be the clear and transparent process for deciding which of several pharmacies in a town would be selected. I would be grateful if the minister would confirm, as he appeared to do last night&mdash;although it is not clear from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record&mdash;whether one of the options under consideration is in the form of an auction and whether we are expecting the pharmacy that is lucky enough to be chosen in a particular town to pay money to the government. Or is it a case, which we had understood until now, of the government paying that pharmacy for any expenses that they might be required to meet?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the minister mentioned a number of issues affecting people who rely on incontinence aids. While I appreciate that his attempts to rationalise federal&hyphen;state relations might have that outcome, will he at least concede that in the short term this budget, in lifting the threshold for the tax concession on medical expenditure from $1,000 to $1,500, is actually going to mean that people who do have to purchase those incontinence aids are worse off as a result of this budget decision?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proper purpose of examining a bill in detailed consideration is not to have another go at question time or Senate estimates. I have been asked very detailed questions. They are normally and properly something that would be done on notice, or placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> .

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will do it as best I can, but I am just saying it is without warning and it is not normally a forum in which one would do this. With regard to Medicare offices, the Health Insurance Commission showed me some draft criteria before the budget, I think. There were four, as far as I remember, some of which I have mentioned. The first was a rapidly declining number of claims, the second was a low absolute number of claims, the third related to geographic proximity&mdash;and off the top of my head I cannot remember what the fourth was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see any inconsistency. It is quite possible that they are not finalised. I do not know off the top of my head whether they have or have not been finalised. I have not seen anything to do with a further set of criteria since before the budget, so it is quite possible they have not been finalised and a minute is working its way through the system to me to do so. I have just assumed there would be no change to those criteria but it is possible that there would be change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for giving people assurances that offices will stay open, I think a check of the records of what I said before and what I said last <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6101"> night would show that the comments I made to my colleagues were on the basis of saying things would be likely. I have talked about the criteria openly. I would be happy to do the same thing for an opposition MP or an independent MP, because I think being elected to this place does give an obligation and that members, in pursuing activities in the area they represent, deserve a degree of courtesy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not many MPs have bothered to come to see me. I have tried not to give assurances, but in one case I pointed out they should be prepared because there is a great likelihood, given a very low absolute number of claims, and in others that given certain other criteria it would be likely. I have tried to leave some flexibility because the process is somewhat at arm's length from me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second question related to auctions. Again, I can inform the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) that not a lot has happened between 10.30 last night and 10.30 this morning in relation to the government and the Pharmacy Guild's negotiations. As soon as they are finalised, we will let everybody know, because there is a good deal of interest on the part of rural MPs&mdash;most of whom are on our side, but I concede that you still have a few rural seats left, although not many. I will treat rural and regional MPs in the same way, regardless of where they sit in this House, for exactly the same reason that I outlined before. To represent people in this place means that you deserve a degree of courtesy. Any MP will have a chance to have an input into that. The final way that we will do it is still subject to detailed negotiations with the guild.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I say in connection with this question that while I do not deny the normal courtesies that we expect and receive from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), the soft and soothing tone used by the minister and the other minister who has been here during the consideration in detail stage of the bill does very little to allay my apprehension and concerns about what is going to happen to Medicare offices in my electorate and in the wider Newcastle region. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There is a great deal of concern in the community about what is taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) for identifying the problems and our concerns with the legislation and raising questions about them. For a Senate estimates committee to be advised that 35 offices will close this year, 51 next year and a total of 84 over three years and then the minister to say that, while it is possible to be exact about how many offices will close, he does not know at this stage which ones they will be is just inconceivable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to know what is going to happen to the Medicare offices in my electorate and the Newcastle region in particular. There is a question about the whole effectiveness of the service delivery of Medicare&mdash;one of the most fundamental areas of concern for people. For people to have to be dependent upon the adequacy of public transport, where practically no public transport exists, to access the offices that may continue to operate or to access unidentified pharmacies or to use part of their refund to use the postal service to secure that refund is simply not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be interested to know whether all the pharmacies in my electorate are going to become subagencies of Medicare. If they are not, what patronage is going to be involved in identifying those that will. The people who have to claim a refund will then presumably be forced to go into a particular pharmacy. If the minister can tell me which ones they are going to be, I think I might take out a share in them at this stage. If people have to go to particular pharmacies to get their refunds, or to arrange for the processing of their refunds, obvious advantages will accrue to those particular pharmacies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is not going to be patronage involved it means that all pharmacies will act as subagents of some kind.

There has been not a brilliant and not a complete network of Medicare offices but certainly a network of Medicare offices which made it possible for most people to access that service. They are the people who are apprehensive. Many of the pharmacists are apprehensive. The people who are employed by Medicare in those offices are apprehensive. I think it is high time the whole question was clarified, made transparent and laid out on the table so that we can be sure that the sort of patronage that this government displayed in relation to the gun buyback proposal will not be extended to Medicare as well.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.28 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be opposing schedule 1. This schedule implements the budget decision to increase the cost of pharmaceuticals for pensioners and other concession card holders by 50c. It may not sound like much to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) but increasing the cost of every script from $2.70 to $3.20 would do several things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all it would increase the cost of essential medications for pensioners. It is actually about an 18 per cent increase in the cost of each script for pensioners who are ill enough to need essential medicines. Most importantly, for the first time it breaks the link between the co-payment for medication and the pharmacy allowance that pensioners receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the co-payment was introduced by the former Labor government we ensured that no pensioner was worse off even if they required 52 or more scripts a year which is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when the safety net cuts in. What this minister and this government have done in unilaterally increasing the cost of medication is break that undertaking to pensioners that they would be no worse off no matter how ill they are and no matter how many drugs they need each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past most people were a little better off because they did not use 52 scripts a year. But, as a result of this legislation, for the first time those pensioners and concession cardholders unlucky enough to need to use those full 52 or more scripts a year are going to be receiving less from the pharmacy allowance than they pay out in their co-payments for their drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that not only is this unfair to those pensioners and concession cardholders but also it is a breach of the undertakings which Dr Wooldridge, the Minister for Health and Family Services, and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), for that matter, made to pensioners before the last election. Before the last election, they said that they would maintain the real value of pensions and concessions that people receive, yet in their first budget they have devalued that pharmacy concession by approximately 18 per cent through this increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The example that I really found a bit outrageous was the claim in the minister's speech that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that the `safety net' arrangements under the PBS are not changing, thus maintaining the high level of protection afforded under this scheme. The annual concession limit to access the safety net will remain at 52 times the patient contribution at $166.40 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The minister is correct in his claim that the safety net stays at 52 times the patient contribution, but he does not explain that it is 52 times $3.20 whereas before it was 52 times $2.70. Minister, your claim that the safety net arrangements are not changing is a rather twisted form of logic. In fact, the safety net increase is from $140.40 to $166.40.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That might not sound like much to someone on a member of parliament's salary or even to someone on average weekly earnings but, if you are a person who lives on the base pension and are a resident of a nursing home, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6103"> 87&half; per cent of your income goes to paying for your accommodation. It leaves you with only a very small amount of money&mdash;around $30 a week&mdash;for things such as your toiletries, clothing, bus fares, telephone calls or pharmaceuticals. This increase takes away about one week's income from such a person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If members of this House had one week's income taken away in additional costs for their drugs or their medication, they would certainly scream loudly, as would any other wage and salary earner. That is why we believe that this measure is unfair, hits pensioners in a terrible way and breaks the promises that were made before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple point is there are lots of pensioners out there who this time decided to trust Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, and give him a go. With this legislation and schedule, the coalition are showing that they have broken that trust; they have betrayed those people who were willing to believe their word when they said that no pensioner concessions would be touched.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just make some brief comments. The basic problem is twofold: firstly, we went into the election with the then Minister for Finance, now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), saying the budget would be in surplus. On 12 March, we were presented with figures from the Department of Finance and the Treasury that showed we were facing an $8 billion deficit that actually slid and was worse than that by the end of the budget process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be nice if there were a magic pudding. But with the pharmaceutical benefits system we also inherited from the Labor Party a system that has a budget substantially larger than that of the state of Tasmania, that had doubled in costs in the previous four years and that was proposed to double or go up 50 per cent in costs in the next four years if no new drugs came on stream. With the new drugs coming on stream, it is expected to go up 100 per cent in costs again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry, I just cannot find an extra $2.6 billion every four years, particularly when we were slugged with a deficit that we were told <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was not there. We have tried to have the least impact we possibly can on people. I concede that the average concessional cardholder will be $8.50 a year worse off&mdash;not a week or month but $8.50 a year&mdash;and that the average old age concessional cardholder will be $15 a year worse off. But the pharmaceutical allowance overcompensates the majority of people, and even after this the majority of pensioners will be overcompensated by the pharmaceutical allowance with the pension. It has not been changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very happy to face the pensioners or anyone in my electorate at any time. I think the pensioners in Lindsay spoke a couple of weekends ago and said exactly what they thought. The fact is that 70 per cent of people in my electorate over 60 years of age have private health insurance and they are very happy at the prospect of being $250 a year better off as the result of being able to get a rebate on private health insurance. If you look at the package as a whole, they are substantially better off, and they know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basic problem the Labor Party has is that they can pick little bits out, they can carp and whinge and nitpick, but the public is sick of that. The public knows the problems. The public wants solutions. That is the reason that the Labor Party vote dropped five per cent further in Lindsay. The public wanted to just make sure they got the message. It appears they have not.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might just remind the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) sitting opposite of the comments the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), when Leader of the Opposition, made on the John Laws program before the election. In answer to a question, `Which would you do, break your promises or have a bigger deficit?' he said, `We won't be breaking our promises.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there are a couple of big broken promises in this bill. One is that concessions to pensioners would not be removed&mdash;a very important promise and one that, as the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has said in previous remarks, did reassure pensioners and make them think that they would not be worse off under this government. They have found that, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6104"> not just as a result of the increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals but a whole range of other increases in costs, they are going to be a lot worse off. It is the case that we have a broken promise, one which the Prime Minister explicitly said before the election would not be broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures are not about restricting the cost of new drugs. The minister makes great play of the problems for the pharmaceutical benefit scheme of the cost of new drugs. That certainly is an issue which any government has to deal with, but slugging pensioners an additional 50c per script does nothing to deal with the cost of new drugs&mdash;absolutely nothing. This is a very complicated area, one that requires a sophisticated response, not just a simple price signal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also needs to be said that concession card holders will be worse off. You say that at the moment the pharmaceutical allowance overcompensates pensioners. Why, in your election campaign, did you say that pensioners would not have any of their concessions reduced? Why did you make them think that, should the price of pharmaceuticals go up, you would increase the pharmaceutical allowance? You did not want to tell them that they would be worse off, that you would not compensate them as they have rightly come to expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard the remarks about Lindsay, but the people of that electorate have not had to pay yet. On 1 January the story in Lindsay and all the other electorates around the country will be quite different once people start paying not just for the increase in pharmaceuticals but also the increased cost of nursing home care. Then there is the increased cost of all the other things that families will have to bear&mdash;child care, HECS payments&mdash;all the costs that will impact on Australian families. Because it is families, not just pensioners, who will pay a lot more for their pharmaceuticals as a result of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister refers to a number of people in his electorate on private health insurance. That has nothing to do with the cost of pharmaceuticals. Those people will face an increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals. They <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be paying $20 per script if they are not on some sort of pension or benefit. Families and pensioners will pay a lot more for their drugs. They will not be compensated by the family tax initiative about which you carry on so much. That will be taken up by all the costs that this budget imposes on families. It will not be the case that families are better off; they will be worse off. Yet another broken promise arises from the myriad of changes in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming back to the pharmaceutical issue: it is having a very big impact; it is making a lot of older people very concerned about their future. Many older people, many chronically ill people, have high pharmaceutical costs&mdash;costs which they have to bear. You might think that an additional $8 is nothing on average, but those who are near the safety net will have a very big payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also the case that families will get no benefit from the safety net until they pay $600. They will be paying $20 a pop until they meet the safety net of $600. That is a very significant increase for those families, especially when children get sick together. It will be $20, $40 or $60 a pop every time they need to go to the doctor. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity to endorse the comments made by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) on the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996. When the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) was making his comments on this issue, to a large extent it was just gobbledegook, such as when he referred to average figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell made it perfectly clear that for many of the most disadvantaged pensioners this government is ripping away the equivalent of one full week's effective income. Don't let us understate this: that is what it amounts to. We have heard it said that an increase from $2.70 to $3.20 is only 50c. But, as the member for Dobell pointed out, that is a savage attack of 18 per cent&mdash;an 18 per cent increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6105"> It is not good enough for the government to claim that it is doing this as a result of inher iting a deficit in excess of the outcome previously expected. The member for Jagajaga quite correctly drew our attention again to the John Laws interview, when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), then opposition leader, was asked whether an incoming Howard government would honour the undertakings it had given, or whether it would seek to eliminate the deficit. The present Prime Minister's commitment on that occasion was absolutely clear. He said that the government would honour its commitment. Of course, it has not done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an undertaking that pensioners would be no worse off&mdash;and that mirrors the undertaking given about industrial relations that workers would not be worse off.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996 I want to make some closing comments in relation to the last two speakers. Obviously, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has not yet worked out why they lost the March election. I am happy for that condition to remain. The longer those opposite fail to work out why they lost, the longer they will be in opposition. The way they are going at the moment, I think it will be for a very long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we have proposed the measures contained in this bill is that the former leader of their party got his figures wrong. The leader of their party said that the budget was in surplus when it was wildly out of surplus. He could have checked those figures, he could have allowed Finance to release the figures. He chose not to. That is the reason we are in the position we are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said that things are going to change after 1 January. Great! If you would like to engineer another by-election after 1 January, we would be happy to take you on and you will get a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> similar result. What the people of Lindsay were trying to tell you was that you have not got the message, and your vote dropped another five per cent just so you would get the message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a good number of inaccuracies in the speech by the member for Jagajaga, but I will not respond to them all. As for the $20 a script, it is $17.40 at the moment. The average number of scripts for a non-concessional card holder is 1.6 a year. So the average person will be paying $4 a year more. I accept that. I would rather it was not the case. If they are concerned, they can send the bill to the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley.</PARA>

People who are sick reach a certain amount, and then they get all their scripts for free. For non-concessionals, we have left the safety net the same. So someone who is sick will not pay a cent more. They will just reach the safety net sooner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last budget, the Labor Party increased the safety net by $200, so every sick person in Australia who was not a concessional card holder had to pay $200 more because of that decision.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Charlton talked about disadvantaged pensioners. I wonder whether he actually knows who he is talking about. The disadvantaged pensioners he is talking about are category 1, 2 and 3 nursing home patients. If the honourable member had spent much time talking to nursing home proprietors, he would know the extreme frailty of these people. It is not as if they shoot down to the local milk bar to buy a packet of cigarettes or some chewing gum. These people have incredibly high dependence needs. Certain information I get tells me that, by and large, they do not spend the limited amount of money they have. I have had numerous complaints from nursing home proprietors saying that the family turns up once every three months and demands the money out of the parent's account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would rather not charge a pensioner $8.50 a year more, but put it in perspective. It is $8.50 a year. Opposition members can whinge all they like and scare people all they like but, in the end, the people are not convinced and they are not going to be convinced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer to some of the remarks that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) made in his earlier contribution. He said that nursing home residents do not use the approximately $30 per week they have left from their pension after they have paid their contribution to the nursing home. This is what the proprietors tell him. I do not know which proprietors he is talking to because it is the case, as he acknowledged, that the vast majority&mdash;in fact, I would have said all nursing home patients&mdash;are on a large number of prescriptions. As a result of being on a large number of prescriptions, they are now going to pay an additional $26 per year, which is equivalent to one week's money in their pocket that they have to spend on essential toiletries, to have a few things that make their life a little more comfortable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea that they are not spending the money and that the families are trying to collect it off the nursing home owners makes me feel as if there are some awful rorts going on out there that this government should be trying to address. It is terribly important that the small amount of money that nursing home patients have left over to them each week is available to make their lives a bit more comfortable. It should not be going to help meet your perceived problems with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are people who are in the last months or years of their lives. You are saying to them that, although they might have only $30 a week, you are going to take $26 off them per year because you have a budget problem, even though you promised them before the election that you would not do this. Older people all around Australia are not your average Australian that you are talking about. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6108"> The vast number of 20-, 30- and 40-year-old people in our country do not need prescriptions. I cannot remember the last time I needed to fill one myself, but I can tell you that I fill them frequently for my children. It is the case that people in their seventies and eighties need to fill prescriptions very regularly. They have weekly prescriptions that need to be filled. They are the people that are going to be paying the extra 50c, which, as the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) said, is an increase of 18 per cent&mdash;a heck of a lot higher than the consumer price index figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea that somehow they are going to be able to distinguish between necessary and unnecessary prescriptions or, even more ridiculous, the idea that people in nursing homes will be able to distinguish between necessary and unnecessary prescriptions is the most heartless remark I have heard in all my life. It is not the case that older people are your average Australians. That is a most dishonest way of presenting statistics. It is the case that healthy young people do not need prescriptions.</PARA>

As the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has said, we will continue to stand up for this group of people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Schedule 2 implements the government's decision in the budget to change the indexation rules for co-payments and for the safety net as well, as I understand it. I would just like to quote from item 1 of schedule 2. This is what this particular schedule implements:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Omit "down to the nearest multiple of 10 cents", substitute "to the nearest multiple of 10 cents. However, if the amount is not a multiple of 10 cents but it is a multiple of 5 cents, the amount is to be increased by 5 cents".</PARA>
<PARA>Those confusing words mean that each year when the government was considering indexing the co-payment for general users, pensioners and concession card holders, the government has always rounded down to the nearest 10c. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I know that has been of great assistance to many of your own constituents who in about 1993 would otherwise have been hit with a 10c increase in the cost of the co-payment for drugs which were obtained by pensioners and other concession cardholders. In that year, as a result of the rounding down, the co-payment was at the lower 10c level rather than being rounded up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes mean that, even when it is a dead heat and is spot on the ball at 5c, this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> heartless government does not round down; it rounds up to the nearest 10c. You would have thought that, if it was spot on the dot halfway, they would have rounded down and given the pensioners and the other general users the benefit of the doubt and a bit of generosity. But that is the last thing you would expect from this mob.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This change might not sound like much but, according to the information in the explanatory memorandum, these changes will deliver $56 million to consolidated revenue. It means that, as a result of this change, pensioners, concession cardholders and families will be paying an extra $56 million for their medication and for their drugs. In many ways, I think it shows the difference between the Labor Party and the coalition government. The coalition has this economic rationalist's approach to working out how much sick people should pay for their medicines whereas we try to give people the benefit of the doubt by rounding down. They use the economist's approach, the approach that means people will end up paying that extra $56 million.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is regrettable that, probably for some good reason, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) cannot be here for this part of the debate. I would just like to touch on the point that the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has made about this particular measure within schedule 2 that it is an economist's&mdash;or bean counter's&mdash;view of the way in which there is an attempt to save money for the PBS. Throughout the debate, the minister has made the point&mdash;and I take it that these are the figures&mdash;that over the last four years the PBS has doubled as an expenditure to government and that it is predicted to grow by 50 per cent over the next four years, even without any new drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in the second reading debate last night, one of my concerns is the way in which the bean counters, as I describe them, of Treasury and of Finance look upon the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. By way of illustration I said that, yet again, the Industry Commission has chosen to make suggestions that tamper with the basis of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, especially the way in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6110"> which new drugs will be put on to the listing. If it is a fact that the cost to government of the scheme is to grow by 50 per cent without new drugs, are the minister's comments to be taken as code such that, in the run-up to next May's budget where we have the machinery of government already working and in place, there will be further measures that will hit the patients?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is going to be pressure from the pharmaceutical industry in trying to get even better prices for the continuing products on the list or for new product, the only way in which the government appears to be addressing the increase in the cost to government of the PBS is to make patients pay. I think it is an unreasonable way to look at the PBS in isolation. It should be looked at in toto.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pharmaceutical benefits scheme sits as part of our health system. We have to continue to improve the basic health of the community; we have to continue to look at the non-drug alternatives to treatment; and, all the time, we have to be conscious of the cost factors involved. The debate that we are having with this piece of legislation illustrates the continuing problem that we have, where people seem to see this completely in dollars and cents terms without addressing the real requirement, and that is to look at the outcomes. If the outcomes require that the more expensive drugs should be listed, so be it. But we then as a community have to deal with how we handle those cost pressures on the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A disappointing aspect of the minister's response has been that he will not give an indication to the House, not only in the case of this piece of legislation but for the future, of what he envisages the government will be required to do. For instance, in the last vote the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) came in and voted with the government. He will have to make a response to the Industry Commission report which suggests that the PBS should be dismantled which will lead to the pharmaceutical industry going holus bolus in a free market attempt to get the best price they can for the pharmaceuticals that are listed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a tradition of the PBS that Australia has managed to keep the cost of drugs capped at as low as possible a level. The PBS has been a mechanism whereby drugs have been made available to the Australian community at the most reasonable price. That is the thing that is continually challenged. We have been mean spirited. That is why the other industry aspects of continuing to assist the pharmaceutical industry are also important&mdash;and they need to be addressed. They have not been addressed in the responses by the minister during this debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(11.16 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have to say that this is the sneakiest way I have ever seen of raising $56 million. No pensioner or user of pharmaceutical drugs will know that they are contributing $56 million to the government coffers as a result of this measure. None of them will know: I am sure they will not be told by the government that this sneaky measure of changing the way the rounding happens will raise $56 million out of sick people's pockets, to help meet this government's budget. I cannot understand why a well&hyphen;established practice that has been to the benefit of sick people has been changed by this government. It can only be seen as the callous measure that it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to say a word in support of the comments by the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins): the idea that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme might be abolished would have to be the most short&hyphen;sighted measure any government could even consider because it is the case that prices have been kept down by Australia having such an outstanding pharmaceutical benefits scheme. If you look at the amount of money that this country spends on drugs compared with the amount spent in similar countries, it is the case that we spend considerably less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the concerns of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) about increases are correct, the idea that we should throw the baby out with the bath water and get rid of the PBS and that somehow market forces&mdash;the great mantra that this government loves so much&mdash;would help bring the price down is absolutely incorrect. In all the other countries around the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6111"> world their experience shows that, unless you have a strong, central government controlling the level of fees or prices charged for pharmaceuticals, you see a massive blow&hyphen;out in the amount the country spends on its essential medicines. My main point is that to take another $56 million out by this rounding method is just plain sneaky&mdash;I cannot think of words that sum it up more appropriately&mdash;because it will not be explained to pensioners or sick people that they are paying it. It is something that should be opposed and the government should come clean about its actions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the comments raised by the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) slightly further in the context of previous years negotiations in this field. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will no doubt remember that the then opposition harassed the then government as it tried to negotiate a new set of arrangements with the pharmaceutical industry. If you recall, there were three components.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first was an extension in patent life; in other words, giving drug manufacturers a longer sale life in Australia. The second component was called factor F: for drugs designed or manufactured in Australia they would be paid a higher price. The third factor was the introduction and acceptance of generic drugs as genuine, legitimate, properly tested and equivalent in every sense drugs to the brand name drugs. Those were the three components.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We fought up hill and down dale in this chamber against the now government's attempts to suggest that this was to the benefit of the PBS system. The pharmacists and, more importantly, the drug industry took the factor F and they took the patent life extension of four years, but when it came to generics the war was on. It was about saying that when a drug's patent life has expired, when it is no longer owned by the person who first designed it, it is reasonable that access to that drug be much cheaper; in other words, that the chemical and bioequivalence should be available for Australians&mdash;and the government should facilitate that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the then opposition fought so hard against that and is now bringing in here the absolutely reverse kind of approach. Rather than its attempting now to help repair the damage it did then to the PBS system&mdash;and the way it operates&mdash;and to the drug companies, what we are seeing is total surrender. If you have a problem with the budget, what do you do? You slog the pensioners. Do not look at the costs or why they are there and do not look at the cost shift from the states to the Commonwealth in terms of hospital discharges in recent years. Do not look at what drugs are available and whether we are paying too much for drugs which are way out of their patent life. Do not examine any of those things. Slog the pensioner instead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the start of my speech last night I made the point that this debate was not about health; it was about budget. Quite frankly, the second reading should have been moved by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). To have the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) arguing here that somehow this was an improvement to the system is a travesty and an insult to all our intelligences. He may have been in here trying to argue for an improvement to the system&mdash;improved communications with pharmacists, improved documentation and improved coordination between pharmacists, doctors and us in terms of what drugs are available in Australia and which drug companies are playing a fair game&mdash;but it is still the case that in Australia very large companies, many of whose turnovers are greater than our federal budget, are still profiteering on drugs whose cost was paid out a decade ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are still making substantial profits on drugs that are costing infinitesimal amounts to produce. Who is paying for it? Australians are. Whether they are paying through the PBS or some other way, they are paying for it. The only answer to that is for the government to be firm, and the PBS has always been the vehicle for that. Remember, we extended the patent life. We gave those companies four extra years of patent life in Australia, which was a bonus to them, on the grounds that they would accept and eventually bring in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6112"> same drugs as generic at a genuine, not an exaggerated, profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those same forces that worked together against the previous government's attempt to improve the system are now working together to rip off pensioners and beneficiaries. Rather than take on the drug companies and get the drugs that are available cheaply, what are you doing? You are slogging them instead. It is outrageous that the same group of people are doing it. If you look at the minister's speech from last night, you will see him saying over and over again that this is an improved system. All the way through he was trying to pretend that somehow this is going to make things better. It will make things much worse. The message is very clear. If you have a budget problem, you slog the people; you do not find a benefit for the system. And that is a disgrace! <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I would like to put on the record this morning the Labor Party's continuing concern about what mechanism the government will put in place so that pharmacists can assess whether or not people are eligible for the subsidies that are available under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, these changes mean that you will be entitled to subsidised drugs under the PBS only if you are an Australian citizen, an Australian resident or you are the citizen of a country with which Australia has a reciprocal health agreement. That will then place an obligation on pharmacists to try to find out who the other people are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is quite happy to support the government in saying that people who are tourists, people on holiday to Australia, should not expect the Australian taxpayer to subsidise their medication. If they come to Australia on a holiday, we would expect them to have travel insurance and that their travel insurance should meet the cost of any medication they need. If they have not taken out travel insurance, then that is a cost that they should meet from their own pockets, just as Australians who travel to other countries would expect that any medication that they need while they are away on holidays should be met from their travel insurance or from their pocket. We think that is quite reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am not sure of is how pharmacists will be expected to pick Australian residents, Australian citizens and people from countries with which we have reciprocal health care agreements. The government might expect pharmacists to check whether someone has a Medicare card&mdash;that would be one way to double&hyphen;check. We would hope that only Australian citizens or residents would have Medicare cards, given that we are picking up the eligibility rules under the Health Insurance Act. To  pick people who are citizens of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> countries with which we have reciprocal health agreements, I imagine that pharmacists might have to check passports or some other form of identification&mdash;perhaps a photo ID or driver's licence might be acceptable. I certainly hope that the government will not be expecting pharmacists to keep detailed paperwork on these things. I hope that at the end of the day maybe the pharmacist's word is good enough that the pharmacist has actually sighted a passport or photo ID of sufficient security to ensure that the taxpayer is not getting ripped off. As I say, I place on record my concern that the government keeps the undertakings the minister made last night that the government would not be pursuing measures that place an undue bureaucratic burden on pharmacists.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill contains a number of items, some of which are non-contentious. A number of items in the bill relate to indexation adjustments for price movements to payments made to universities. Some of the other provisions reflect some of the more benign aspects of the coalition's announcements on higher education, such as the increases in research infrastructure spending, the system of merit scholarships and so forth. These clearly are matters that we would support. It has to be stressed, however, that they scarcely begin to offset the very negative impact on the higher education system of the other measures that the government is taking, particularly the cuts in university operating grants and other forms of funding and the changes that are being brought about through measures in this bill to the higher education contribution scheme, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6114"> allowing the charging of full fees to Australian undergraduates, the changes to the open learning system and so forth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of measures in the bill that we will be opposing very strongly. We are on the public record as saying that we are fundamentally against the proposals to increase the level of HECS and to reduce the threshold at which repayments of HECS become payable, as well as the proposal to allow universities to charge full fees. When we get to the detailed consideration of the bill I will be moving a number of amendments to the schedule setting out these changes to delete the items that we find objectionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be opposing these measures right down the line. We will be dividing on the third reading, assuming our amendments are not agreed to by the House. We will continue that opposition when the legislation goes on to the Senate. We think these are fundamental issues. We have fundamental concerns and objections to what the government is doing in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth noting at this point that the bill is noteworthy not just for what is included in it but for what it omits. The key thing that it omits that you would expect a piece of higher education legislation at this time to include is the legislative provision for funding for the last year of the rolling triennium. It was the practice of the previous government after the budget and once the issues had been settled about the total amounts to be allocated to higher education to legislate to amend the Higher Education Funding Act to incorporate those amounts specified in the act for the three years of the rolling triennium. The rolling triennium now should include the years 1997, 1998 and 1999. This bill does not include the funding relating to 1999. We think that is a very major concern, as does the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Vice Chancellors Committee and the National Tertiary Education Union and other organisations directly involved with the sector have expressed very grave concern about what this implies for the stability and security of funding for universities in the coming period. This is a particular concern, obviously, in the light of what the government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has already done by announcing that it will be paying to universities less than the amounts already legislated for for 1997 and 1998. The way the Higher Education Funding Act is framed the minister has a capacity to make a determination under the act to pay an amount less than the maximum specified in the act, something we never did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) has announced that she will, effectively, undermine that triennial funding arrangement both by not legislating for the 1999 funding and also by determining amounts for 1997 and 1998 less than those already specified in the act. We are very concerned about that. We believe that that is part of a matrix of decisions this government has taken on higher education that will fundamentally transform the system over the coming years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is significant that at the time of announcing its higher education budget measures for this year that was done in a separate statement 10 days or so before the budget&mdash;the government also announced that it would be conducting a review of higher education policy and funding. We think it is extraordinary, given that the government expresses a view that it is necessary or desirable to have a fundamental review of all aspects of higher education funding, that it would be taking decisions of this degree of significance and magnitude within the short-term context of this year's budget. We think it is very short-sighted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to stress that these decisions are not minor incremental changes. They are very significant changes. We believe that they will have a very significant and negative effect on both the quality and accessibility of higher education in this country. When I say `accessibility' I mean accessibility to people irrespective of their backgrounds and irrespective of their degree of relative disadvantage. Professor Bruce Chapman, the designer of the original HECS scheme, in a paper he released recently in which he discusses the impact of this government's budget decisions makes the point: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6115">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to Australia's higher education system announced in the 1996/97 Budget have more potential to transform financial arrangements than any other funding policy variations introduced over the last 30 years. This includes the abolition of fees in 1974 and the introduction of HECS in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>That was said by Professor Chapman who, as the architect and designer of HECS, is obviously well acquainted with the scheme. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three important points: there is now a different basis determining the relative charge for courses; there are increased effective charges for not just all future students, but also all current HECS debtors; and there will be an inevitable increase in the composition of enrolments towards students from rich backgrounds as the currently universal HECS arrangements move towards a system in which a significant minority of students are paying up&hyphen;front fees.</PARA>
<PARA>These changes are very significant and will have a very profound impact. We think it is indefensible that the government has chosen to go down this route without first carefully evaluating the potential impact of these changes and without first seeing whatever emerges from its broad based review of higher education funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are particularly concerned about the impact of these changes on equity of access to higher education. In government for over 13 years, we made it a major priority to greatly expand access to university education. You can see that in the aggregate numbers. The number of students in our universities grew from around 350,000 in 1983 to over 600,000 last year, a very large increase. That was matched by a very large increase in the real level of Commonwealth funding for universities. That went up by about 70 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the degree of access to people in our society, if you focus on school leavers, there are some interesting tables in DEETYA's publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Selected Higher Education Funding 1995</EMPHASIS>. If you look at the 17 to 19 age group, which you can regard as most relevant when assessing access for school leavers, the level of participation per thousand of population increased by about 60 per cent over the period that we were in government. So notwithstanding the claims that are sometimes made&mdash;and I note the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister has sometimes said that opportunities for school leavers fell during particular periods&mdash;the overall impact during our period in government has been a very major and significant increase in the level of opportunities to participate in higher education by school leavers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also made it a very significant priority to expand not just the number of places and access across the board, but access for groups who are particularly disadvantaged. I do not pretend that by any means we achieved everything that we set out to achieve in that area, but there were some notable achievements. These are documented in a report by the Higher Education Council on the effectiveness of the former government's equity programs which was released earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It showed that particular groups&mdash;and I instance Aboriginals, people from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds and women in non&hyphen;traditional areas of study&mdash;had very significant improvements in terms of access and participation. If you take Aboriginals, for example, from 1990 to 1995, the number of Aboriginal students participating in higher education rose by about 50 per cent. That same report, as Senator Vanstone has pointed out on a couple of occasions, also showed that the share in university enrolments of people from low socioeconomic backgrounds and people from rural and isolated backgrounds did not improve. That is true, but bear in mind that the absolute numbers of people from those backgrounds participating in higher education grew quite significantly. In other words, while people from those disadvantaged backgrounds did not increase their share of university intakes, they certainly were able to benefit from the overall growth in participation numbers that took place during our period of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is singularly ironic that the minister raises that matter because when we talk about HECS I think it is important to look at the HECS impact on people's decision as to whether to participate in higher education. A range of studies that we conducted back in 1992 showed that the group which were most sensitive in terms of their participation decisions to changes in HECS were precisely those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6116"> groups which have proved to be most difficult to improve in terms of raising overall participation rates&mdash;that is, people from low socioeconomic backgrounds and people from rural backgrounds. If you combine those characteristics, you start to see&mdash;even back in 1992 when we did the studies and even at the level of HECS at which we pitched it&mdash;that they were the group most likely to be deterred. I think about 20 per cent cited HECS as a significant factor affecting their decision to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is singularly ironic that the minister, in seeking to disparage the achievements of the previous government in this area, refers to our lack of achievement in regard to those groups and then in this budget proposes to ramp up HECS by a very large amount, given that these are the very groups that are most likely to be deterred by a HECS increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we sought to do in government in the higher education area was to achieve a system where access to the maximum extent feasible was a function of motivation and capacity and not of financial means. That is the central equity issue and that is the central national interest issue when we talk about arrangements for higher education funding&mdash;avoiding a circumstance where people are not able or do not feel that they are able to participate in higher education because of a less advantaged background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had some significant runs on the board in that area. We did not achieve everything we wanted, but in so far as we did increase the proportion of people from low socioeconomic background&mdash;we certainly increased their absolute numbers&mdash;any deficiency in the previous government's achievement in this area will obviously and clearly be compounded by what the current government is doing in regard to HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect to which we attached great priority in government was addressing the regional aspect of disadvantage in terms of access to higher education opportunities. We accorded a very high priority to developing new regional institutions. We put hundreds of millions of dollars into capital developments at new universities&mdash;for example, in New South Wales, the University of Western <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Sydney, Charles Sturt University and others. We believe that the impact of this government's decisions will be particularly detrimental to that aspect of what we sought to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn to some of the specific measures contained in the bill. The bill is notable for the omission of the inclusion of funding for the out year of the rolling triennium. This is all done against the background of major cuts in higher education expenditure. If you add together the cut in operating grant, which is in excess of $600 million, and the abolition of discretionary funds, which is a cut in excess of $200 million, you are up over $800 million over the forward estimates period. You have to also combine that with the decision to not provide supplementation for academic salaries, which will have the most significant impact of all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that it is prepared to consider financial assistance in particular cases where institutions are seeking to facilitate salary negotiations at the institutional level. It has been made very clear to the universities by DEETYA, as I understand it, that the most that can be expected in this regard is some adjustment in cash flow&mdash;in other words, a bringing forward of funding for universities but not a real substantive increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gavin Brown, who I understand is a mathematician by training and is Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of Sydney University, estimated that by the year 2000 there would be an effective 15 per cent cut for his institution as a combined result of these decisions. The Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee and others have put the effective combined cut resulting from non&hyphen;supplementation and cuts to operating grants and discretionary funding in the range of 10 to 12 per cent. It is hardly a nick, to quote Senator Vanstone's term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the measures in this bill, you really have to take this overall constraint on funding and the reduction in effective available funding for institutions into account when you think about the potential impact of HECS increases and full fees. You cannot consider these things in isolation. As the demand for higher education resumes its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6117"> growth in the longer term&mdash;and there is a bit of a demographic dip at the moment&mdash;how is that growth going to be accommodated? Is it going to be accommodated through increases in Commonwealth funding on the basis of HECS paying places? I do not believe so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is&mdash;and I think the universities are becoming reconciled to this&mdash;that the growth will be in the fee paying area. That will mean that in the more lucrative and attractive courses over time you are going to see a progressive substitution of full fee places for HECS paying places. The government claims to have safeguards in that area. I do not believe for a minute that they will be workable. In any case, that does not deal with the question of growth. The growth area is going to be in full fee places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Professor Chapman points out, the impact of this over time will be a severe diminution in the level of equity of access to our system. It will mean that certain professions will be restored as bastions of privilege. You will have to pay very large sums to get into them. You will have to be prepared to undertake very substantial levels of financial risk. Clearly, people from low socioeconomic backgrounds are going to be less inclined and less able to incur that level of financial risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the HECS changes, I think what has been proposed is tragic in terms of its implications. We had at the outset&mdash;and this is not just my view; a number of respected academic commentators have confirmed this&mdash;succeeded in creating one of the most accessible systems of higher education in the world. The HECS, when it was introduced, involved a degree of cost recovery and user pays, but it was very carefully designed to avoid constituting a barrier to participation for people from low income backgrounds. That was reflected in the basic structure of the scheme with the income contingent repayment mechanism and a zero real interest rate so people did not have to start paying until their incomes were above average weekly earnings. We thought that was a reasonable benchmark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also reflected in the level at which we pitched tax, which was a bit over 20 per cent of average course costs. It was also <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reflected in the importance we attached to continued monitoring of the impact of HECS on participation decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We introduced a legislative requirement that the Higher Education Council report regularly to parliament on the impact of HECS on participation decisions. At the time we made the initial decision to go down the HECS route we said that we would commission a body of research to give us some indication of what the likely impact of HECS would be on participation decisions. That research was conducted, most of it in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It broadly confirmed that, at the level we had pitched it at and with the structure we had created, it was not going to have a major impact in terms of deterring people from disadvantaged backgrounds from participating. Having said that, you cannot say that it was a completely non&hyphen;existent factor. There are particular subgroups, particularly those from low socioeconomic backgrounds and residing in rural areas, that did start to show some significant proportion potentially being deterred by HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ramp it up by an order of magnitude in the way which is being done, without any real knowledge and any underlying research to get a sense of what the probable impact of it will be, we think, is highly irresponsible and highly likely to constitute a problem for people from low income backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rationale for differential HECS was considered by the government at the time HECS was introduced. It was considered and rejected for what we regarded as good and cogent reasons. The sort of rationale that underpinned our rejection of differential HECS is starting to be borne out already, even at this early stage in what we are seeing with enrolment application patterns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of our key concerns at the time was that there are courses which are relatively expensive to teach&mdash;and that includes many of the technology and science based subjects&mdash;but which do not necessarily lead on to hugely lucrative career paths, but which are areas of education and training which are very important from the national point of view if we are to have a work force which is scientifically and technologically competent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6118">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing with the early information on enrolments is very interesting and disturbing. We do not have the full information yet because it is not generally available in all states. But I have had my staff ring around a variety of institutions to try to get a sense of what has been going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see in some cases quite catastrophic declines in applications for enrolment in fields like science and engineering. The University of Western Sydney, for example, has had an overall decline in student numbers of 8&half; per cent but a 41 per cent decline in engineering and a 14 per cent decline in science and technology. Even in Queensland, where, contrary to the national trend, there has been overall growth in applications, science and engineering have suffered. For example, at the Central Queensland University, which had overall growth of six per cent, there is a 20 per cent decline in applications for science courses and a seven per cent decline in engineering courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing that decline in some of the areas of study that are really essential to this country's future if it is to be a country capable of sustaining industries producing sophisticated manufactures and sophisticated services and having a good scientific knowledge base and qualified science and mathematics teachers. The latter is another major problem. We are seeing the prospect of a critical shortage of teachers generally at some point in the future, but particularly in the area of science and mathematics teaching.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You look at all that and ask yourself: in terms of the national interest, what are the implications of these changes? I think they are very serious, particularly when you consider the impact of some of the government's other decisions, such as in the research and development area, where there are clear indications that quite a bit of the research and development activity conducted by the private sector is likely to move offshore. What is the combined impact of these changes? I would argue it is a very significant detriment to this country. We have to be concerned about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also clear that people particularly affected by the reduction in the HECS repayments threshold are showing evidence of a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decline in interest in higher education. The best reflection of that is the numbers of mature age applicants for university admission. In some cases, the falls are quite stark. In Victoria, for example, there is a 1.4 per cent decline in school leaver applications but a 14.7 per cent decline in non&hyphen;year 12. What does this mean for people being able to access the education and training system throughout their lives? There is a lot of rhetoric spouted about the importance of lifelong learning. And it is not just rhetoric; it is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of these changes, it is going to be increasingly difficult for people who need to support a family&mdash;and therefore need to earn some sort of an income&mdash;to justify or sustain participation in higher education. Given this sharp drop in the repayments schedule to $20,700, these people will, in many cases, be having to make repayments at the very time they are studying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the HECS rises and their impact on science applications, Dr John Rice, who is the President of the Australian Council of Deans of Science, has pointed to what he describes as a `quantum' reduction in applications for science, which he directly attributes to the impact of the government's changes to HECS. This was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 24 October 1996. The President of the Australian Council of Deans of Education has pointed out that there is a significant impact on potential production of qualified teachers in science and mathematics. These are very serious impacts from these HECS changes which, as well as diminishing the equity of higher education provision, are going to mean that the accessibility of the system throughout people's working lives is going to be severely diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rationale for differential HECS is also fundamentally flawed. It is all very well to say that statistically on average graduates in a particular course will earn a certain amount. You can compute an average, but the reality is that there is a huge amount of variation around that average. Take law, for example. People who go into practice in community legal centres or the very high proportion of law graduates who go into professions or occupations other than the practice of law are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6119"> going to be affected by the presumption that they will be achieving earnings that, in reality, they will not achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the concern is with achieving more equitable distribution of lifetime earnings and income, the HECS structure is not the appropriate instrument to achieve that objective. There are other and far more direct mechanisms to do that, the obvious one being the taxation system. It is certainly not rational to try to use the HECS system as a means of equalising and achieving a more equitable distribution of lifetime earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are fundamentally opposed to the fee changes, for the reasons I have already outlined. You are going to see, as the system continues to grow, the progressive substitution of HECS paying places by fee paying places. The reality is that some institutions are going to be particularly severely affected by that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Charles Sturt University, which is in western New South Wales, is an example. Quite a high proportion of its generic business students come from metropolitan Sydney. They are facing the combination of a sharply increased rate of HECS and the cost of moving, and of parents supporting their move, away from home. If the University of New South Wales, or any of the other long&hyphen;established metropolitan Sydney universities start to offer full fee paying places in the same area, the potential impact on institutions like Charles Sturt could be quite serious and will undermine that key dimension that we focused on in government&mdash;that is, trying to make sure that the locational aspect of educational disadvantage was effectively addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not much time to talk about the open learning changes in this bill. Needless to say, we oppose the opening up of the open learning courses for unrestricted fee charging. I was the minister responsible for the initiation of the open learning system. It was certainly not my intention to create a Trojan Horse for the demolition of the whole current structure and system of access to higher education. We will be opposing those measures in the legislation as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion: this bill contains a mixture of measures, some of which are unobjectionable, some of which we will support. But it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> also contains a number of the core decisions in this year's higher education budget that we find profoundly objectionable and which we will be opposing right down to the wire when this bill goes to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we get to consideration in detail, I will be moving a series of amendments which seek to delete from the schedule to the act containing the substantive measures those which we find particularly objectionable. Assuming that those amendments will be defeated in the House of Representatives, as no doubt they will be, we will be opposing and dividing on the third reading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That approach will be taken to the bill as a whole because we think these measures are so objectionable that such a level of opposition is warranted. We will be pursuing that level of opposition in the Senate. Whereas the outcome in this chamber is predetermined, that is not the case in the Senate. I can tell you that we will be going right down to the wire on this issue and doing everything in our power to defeat the bill and overcome these objectionable proposals.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the government's Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. Having listened to the last comments the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) made, I am highly disappointed that, firstly, he finds this bill objectionable and, secondly, that the opposition will not support the legislation but will vote against it, as he says, `down to the wire'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have known for a very long time that there are various degrees of benefit from this business we call higher education. I have said in this place before that, essentially, the public certainly derives benefit from higher education. Industry, business and commerce also derive benefit by virtue of the fact that the outputs of the education system&mdash;the educated students&mdash;are available to pursue business, technical and industry careers which benefit the businesses they work for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third benefit is to the individual who chooses to go to an institution of higher learning, who is capable of undertaking the study, and who has the will and determination to last through that study and obtain the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6120"> appropriate outcome, be it a diploma, a degree or a higher degree, and who is able to use those both to personal benefit and to the benefit of the broader society. This morning I will look at each of those three benefits and see how this bill impacts on them and at where higher education is heading in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last year or two it has occurred to me that industry, which is one of the beneficiaries I talked about, has perhaps too little a part to play in our system of education, be it at the primary or secondary level, the technical and vocational education level, or at the higher education level. We have created an almost totally government&hyphen;dominated education business in this country. There is nothing wrong with that except that it sends a message to private industry that it need not participate, that government will take care of educating our citizens and that industry need not supply their resources to help in that effort because government will take care of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government takes taxation revenue from the general population and from trade and industries on profits and capital gains. It then reapplies it to a number of mechanisms for social good&mdash;welfare, the defence of our nation and, of course, the education of our citizens. But the more I think about this the more I feel there is no particular reason for government to go beyond the funding of the public provision of education and deliver that education. I am not sure why government has to own and run schools. The more I think about this the more I am enthused by the prospect of government funding education while others supply it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government has not been very good at running industry. That is why the former government, 13 years worth, did its best to sell and privatise the majority of major government&hyphen;owned assets. Part of it, sure, was to get some income because they could not balance the books and were not willing to attack the deficit problem, as this government is willing to do. But, on the other side of the coin, they also knew that for efficiency, productivity and competition reasons, government need not be the absolute providers of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> businesses or services that others can logically provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely nothing to indicate that education should be a monopoly service. There is no reason, once government takes taxes from people and redistributes them by paying for education at all levels, that government then has to be a monopoly supplier. We should think about opening up all sectors to increasing competition from the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill ensures a fairer balance between the public and private benefits derived from higher education. I have said before when talking about this concept that there are millions of people in this country who contribute to the public purse but who will never derive any benefit, other than the social benefit of having a more enlightened nation, from higher education because they will not be participating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people will go to high school, find a job and perhaps take a few TAFE courses or private industry training courses and get on with their lives. They will never ever go to a university, yet they pay taxes that fund the university places for those who do have the intellect, the drive, the will and the energy to go on to university to complete university qualifications. Those people who do go to university almost inevitably earn more money than those who do not. They derive greater benefit. Yet millions of our citizens who do not go to university help pay their bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill brings a bit more balance into the equation, because we have asked students to make a greater contribution. We have also asked them to make a greater contribution in a differential sense&mdash;that is, by designating three categories of courses where the government and the department believe that, on average, higher incomes will be earned by the individuals who complete them. So those individuals are asked to pay a bit more towards the cost of their courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That seems to me to be reasonable. It seems to me to be unreasonable to ask someone who is studying for an arts degree and wants to be a librarian in a public library on Public Service pay levels to pay the same contribution for a three&hyphen;year or four&hyphen;year university degree as a medical student, who will earn <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6121"> many times the income of that arts student who wants to go on to be a librarian. So it is reasonable that we ask those who will benefit more to contribute more of their own income in this sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the total public benefit of universities, we need to examine why we have universities in the first place. I would say that there are a number of factors. The first is that universities, as I was taught, teach their students how to learn. That is the major reason for having universities&mdash;to teach individuals who undertake the course work how to learn. It would be unrealistic to expect people to go through a four-year course, sit through class after class and lecture after lecture and read book after book, and then retain all of that knowledge in a secondary memory bank in the back of their heads so they could get instant recall of everything they learnt in every course they ever took.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell honourable members that I frequently wondered, as I struggled through the theory of statistics at university, why on earth I ever needed the theory of statistics or what I would ever do with it. In fact, I am quite certain that I have never had to develop a statistical equation from what I learned in that class. But I did learn a lot about logic. I learnt a lot about numerical logic, how the system of mathematics is put together and how one develops statistical equations, which changed a bit of my thinking process. So I cannot say that the course was not worth while. It did teach me how to learn. It taught me how to learn, but not necessarily each of the individual, discrete skills I may have used some time later in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect, the world of work, as we all know, is changing dramatically. In the future, it is unrealistic to expect that one would go to primary school, secondary school and university, get a job and stay with that company for life. I predict that 30&hyphen; and 40&hyphen;year watches will go out of style, because we are finding increasingly that people are changing their career paths. They move up in their jobs. They gain a greater capacity and shift to another occupation, another career or another company. We are going to see this increasingly happen, as we have seen part-time and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> casual work increase rapidly over the past decade. So learning how to learn is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing we learn at university is definitive skills. A university is no different from a TAFE college in that it teaches definitive skills. I can tell honourable members that employers around the nation are finally making an impact on universities. They are making them realise that their course structure needs to be more up-to-date and that they need to think more about modern, relevant skill development to make their graduates more employable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect, I acknowledge and commend the work of the Berwick campus of Monash University and the Casey TAFE at Berwick, which are working together in dual courses whereby a student obtains both a degree and a diploma from TAFE. Employers will value those pieces of paper because they will know that the students not only have studied the theoretical aspects of the course but have been trained in many of the practical aspects. Those students will be employable upon graduation, rather than having to go back and do other work in order just to be able to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, I note, a number of graduates in my electorate who have chosen to go to TAFE after they have finished university to get some TAFE relevant work skills before they actually put themselves on the job market. They do that because, when they go to get a job, they want to be able to get the job they want and they know they will be more employable. So I commend the Berwick campus of Monash and Casey TAFE for the work they are doing conjointly to develop courses that will give young people more relevant skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area that we gain from universally in higher education is an area you could call thinking. In the education sector, we produce people who learn how to think, how to put those thoughts on paper and how to communicate those thoughts to other people, and they can do it in a better fashion than those who have not gone through some structured, rigorous, academic program. That is important for us as a nation. It is important that we have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6122"> people who are philosophers, who can think about the nature of life, the nature of work, the nature of mankind and the nature of our relationship with our environment&mdash;all these things that, in our day-to-day work lives, we probably never give two seconds of thought to. The universities provide a very useful institutional opportunity for people to think and to communicate their thoughts for the betterment of all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of our institutions are research institutions. I commend this bill for the increase in funding for research. We have known for a very long time that we have had a problem in Australia with Australian companies devoting enough of their overall turnover or sales to research and development. I have to say that I am pleased that industry seems to be increasingly concentrating on research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of our most successful companies are now spending huge proportions of their sales on basic and applied research and development to develop new products, to further develop products they already make and to make products they have more marketable to meet the requirements of other markets overseas so that they can help us address our balance of payments problem. That is very positive, but we still need to support academic research within our tertiary institutions. So I commend the extra spending on research. Australia has a long and proud history in funding public sector research both through the universities and through CSIRO, and I am pleased to note that the government has maintained its commitments and increased its commitments in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Social and economic infrastructure are items which are also addressed by our tertiary training institutions. In the local example I just quoted you of the Berwick campus of Monash, we have great hopes that the newly announced public hospital for Berwick will be built on our university site and, over time, will become a teaching hospital. That will give the community huge opportunities to develop young minds, to develop training and expertise and new and modern medical techniques to work with the communication facilities at the Berwick campus and with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doctors and scientists in other countries. This will help improve overall our access to modern medicine techniques and our communications with other people who are doing similar work in the same or other fields in other countries. Universities contribute to the social and economic infrastructure of our nation, and they need to be supported in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding what the member for Sydney had to say, the bill provides increases of $7 million in 1996, of $7.7 million in 1997 and $24.5 million in 1998 on the current legislated amount. While there is some decrease in funding on Labor's forward estimates, nonetheless the government is maintaining its commitment to the tertiary sector by maintaining funding. There is a dramatic increase in funding available to the universities if they take up the options of filling all of their funded places and then offering some more of their places to students who pay their HECS contribution. That contribution, instead of going into general revenue, will go straight back to the university. So where they have the capacity to add a few more students to individual courses, those universities will have the added capacity of taking further students and receiving the HECS payments themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second opportunity is an issue that I began speaking about in this House many years ago, and that is a matter of equity. It has seemed to me for a very long time that it was totally inequitable that we would offer full fee paying places to overseas students but not to Australian students. How was it fair that, if you were born in the Philippines or in Indonesia or in the United States or in England, you could come to Australia, pay fees to go to university and be assured of a place because the university had welcomed you with open arms but, if you were born in Melbourne or my village of Berwick and you qualified to go to university but did not make the financially imposed cut&hyphen;off, you could not get a place. The only way you could get a place at all to pay your way through university was to go overseas where the other students came from. How equitable is that? It was always a nonsense and we have fixed that. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6123">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I absolutely praise the minister for taking that action, because it will give thousands of young people who otherwise might not have had the opportunity the opportunity to participate. I welcome absolutely the funding for 4,000 students to have scholarships between now and the year 2000, maintaining the government's commitment to those who come from low income backgrounds and who have outstanding academic qualifications to give them a real opportunity to participate in university life and in tertiary education generally. I recommend the bill to the House. I am disappointed that the opposition, the Labor Party, does not see fit to support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a lame defence from the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) for what I think is the greatest attack which has occurred in this country on tertiary education this century. We have had in Australia a progressive expansion of tertiary education, a progressive revolution in participation in tertiary education which this bill threatens to knock on the head. All the member for La Trobe can do is come into this place and demonstrate once again his hostility to all things public, his obsession with the private sector, and propose that we have privately run universities, privately run schools and that we abandon government involvement and government commitment to education and to tertiary education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Many years ago we did have these things, but it was precisely because the private sector failed&mdash;it could not provide a decent education system; it could not provide a decent tertiary education&mdash;that government&hyphen;funded universities developed. If we were to go back to that system, in time it would be the case that only the wealthy would get access to universities. You would not have standards being guaranteed; you would have a mishmash of standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the courses and disciplines to which the member for La Trobe referred, like philosophy and the courses which contribute to this nation's rich intellectual culture, would wither and die on the vine. It is remarkable that the member for La Trobe can come into this place and mount such a lame defence for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this legislation. I think that is one of the reasons why his electorate will, in my view, be one of the first to fall at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is a remarkable bill. It appears that it may well be changed before it even gets through the parliament. I draw the attention of the House to comments made by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 24 September. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . she may review proposals to charge high fees to university students studying to be mathematics and science teachers.</PARA>
<PARA>The article said that the minister had told the deans of Australia's education faculties:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the HECS changes first had to get through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>It actually sounded like she was hoping she would get off the hook because they would not get through the Senate. But, if they did get through the Senate, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if there was a problem with the differential fees, the Government would fix it.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Vanstone was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 28 September as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government would reconsider its Budget changes to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme if evidence showed higher charges were deterring students from taking science and engineering courses . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concession came as the vice&hyphen;chancellor of the University of Sydney, Professor Gavin Brown, told students the shift to a three-tier HECS system was a "gratuitous act of violence which showed a lack of understanding on the part of politicians&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I hasten to add Liberal politicians&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">about the impact of their decisions".</PARA>
<PARA>Well might Senator Vanstone be considering reviewing this legislation and these proposals even before they go through the parliament.

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Extraordinarily, the University of New South Wales has put forward the idea of subsidising up to half the cost of students' science degrees in a bid to halt the dramatic decline in enrolments in these courses. Once again, Dr Rice has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is starting to become a client nation . . . [one] that only buys things that are made overseas, but it doesn't actually produce any of those technological goods . . . that actually makes you a national backwater if it keeps going on.</PARA>

<PARA>We have here a drop in enrolments as a result of this legislation, which may well need to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6125"> reviewed in the event that the legislation gets through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will make Australia, according to evidence submitted to the Senate inquiry, the second highest fee&hyphen;charging country in the world for students in public universities. The National Tertiary Education Union's submission to the Senate inquiry indicated that the World Bank recommended that students in public institutions should not be charged above 30 per cent of the cost of study. Back in 1994 the World Bank conducted a survey which placed Australia as about average internationally in the study cost for students through HECS. With these proposed amendments, we will have a situation where only students in South Korea will pay more for study in a public institution, according to that World Bank chart. The union has also expressed the view that these changes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will be destabilising, unequal in their impact, and will result in unintended consequences of some significance for quality and equity.</PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, the architect of the HECS proposals, Professor Bruce Chapman, has said that the government's changes will have more potential to transform the system than any other funding policy variations introduced during the past generation. He is concerned that the government's decision to allow universities to charge undergraduates up-front fees for 25 per cent of enrolments could lead the higher education sector, in his view `in the least desirable economic and social directions'. Professor Chapman also said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without a HECS&hyphen;type loan mechanism, the charging of up-front fees for 25 per cent of students will have the inescapable consequence of the Australian higher education system becoming one with an increased composition of the student body from wealthy families willing to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moving towards up-front fees also means a greater entrenchment of the nexus between one's socioeconomic background and future life opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have it! There could be no greater contrast between the Liberal and Labor parties than our respective approaches to education. It is Labor who, in the words of Paul Keating, are the enlargers; it is Labor who have promoted tertiary education opportunities through <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the measures of the Whitlam government and, subsequently, through the measures of the Hawke and Keating governments. Our vision of Australia as a clever country; our understanding that Australia's future opportunities depended on having a well-educated, skilled nation and a skilled work force; and our understanding that the life chances of individuals also depend, more than anything else, on the quality of the education that we get&mdash;that was what the Whitlam, Hawke and Keating governments understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were able to generate a revolution in participation in education. When we came to office, the number of students completing secondary education was just one in three; during our period in office we increased that to over two in three. It was not just enough to focus on secondary education; we also focused on post&hyphen;secondary and tertiary education. Total enrolments at universities increased from 350,000 back in 1983 to some 630,000 this year, with the proportion of 17- to 19-year-olds participating rising by over 60 per cent during this period. That did not come about through accident; that came about through the commitment and the hard effort of those Labor governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But now we have the Liberal view. They, by contrast, are the straighteners and reducers. It is not their view that education should be available to all. If you have access to all, that diminishes the advantages which go to the sons and daughters of the wealthy in terms of their capacity to get a quality education. It is also not their view that we need a skilled nation. They linger in the past in this view of workers as having arms and legs&mdash;just being that pool of labour that they want to be able to use in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Liberal view of education is once again leading to a reduction in participation, which is shown through the reduction in enrolments around the nation that I categorised. For the first time since 1983 we will see a decline in the percentage of Australians going on to enjoy and participate in tertiary education. The coalition, when in opposition, had something altogether different to say about what Labor had achieved in our revolution in higher education participation. Let me <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6126"> quote what Senator Robert Hill wrote in a letter to the National Union of Students in December last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Coalition has been very critical of the reduction of commonwealth expenditure in real terms per student following the Dawkins reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this is a matter of making education more efficient. Everywhere else you get criticised if you spend more per student on education or more per head in health. But here they say, `No, this is a bad thing.' What was occurring was a dramatic increase in the numbers of students participating in tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition in their document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quality, diversity and choice</EMPHASIS>&mdash;which has been shown to be a fraud, a charade&mdash;told students:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Coalition will at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities in terms of operating grants and research grants.</PARA>
<PARA>They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition recognises that the significant per capita reduction of Commonwealth funds under Labor has had a detrimental effect on quality. This has been evident in overcrowded lectures, unworkable tutorials and inadequate libraries. The financial squeeze also has detrimentally affected research infrastructure, research training and research capacity. Overall, this has put at risk the quality of both education and research.</PARA>
<PARA>It is little wonder that people like the Vice-Chancellor at Latrobe University, Professor Michael Osborne, said, on looking at these quotes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to see how even devotees of Alice in Wonderland can view these commitments as equivocal.</PARA>
<PARA>We have a government weeping crocodile tears on behalf of those in the student and academic communities, encouraging them to believe the coalition were sympathetic to them and had a commitment to higher education. But what did the coalition do? What are they doing with this bill? You will find there are net savings of $2 billion over four years being achieved, first, by funding cuts; second, by dramatically increased HECS charges; and, third, by making universities absorb the costs of staff salary increases to the tune of some $200 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is from the coalition which said they were going to maintain spending on higher <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education. We are seeing the HECS repayment threshold changed so that instead of the threshold being $28,000 per annum, it is being dropped to $20,700 per annum from 1 July next year. Many more students and former students will be forced to repay HECS before they are earning the average weekly income. That, in turn, will deter a lot of people from ordinary families and a lot of battlers from going to university and enjoying the benefits of university education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is part of the triple whammy on young people: they are facing something like a $1.8 billion cut from labour market programs, they are facing the industrial relations legislation which will exploit young people in terms of the amount of time they are expected to spend on training and they are being attacked through the higher HECS charges. So we have a coalition which tricked people into thinking that they in the coalition were sympathetic to higher education and that they would look after students better. But what we find in this legislation are measures which will reduce the level of participation in this nation on higher education, to the detriment of Australia's wellbeing and to the detriment of many people from ordinary families who will not be able to go to university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of people in my electorate have indicated that they will not be able to afford to send their children to university under the higher HECS charges, under that three&hyphen;tiered HECS system where in some courses we will have a rise from $2,442&mdash;the present level&mdash;to $5,500. In each case we will have rises to $3,300. So this is a measure which indicates the Liberal Party's lack of concern for education and their lack of concern for the needs of young people to have better educational opportunities. I regret very much the damage it is likely to do to the future of this country. It will affect our nation's competitiveness, our productivity and our living standards in years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very short&hyphen;sighted decision to have a government saying that these budget cuts are planning for the future and saying that we do not want to leave our children with a legacy of debt. But if we do not leave our children with the legacy of a decent education, their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6127"> capacity for improved living standards will be very much diminished. It is not smart to say that we do not want to leave our children with a legacy of debt but then say we will not be able to provide them with a tertiary education. That is not the way to prepare this nation for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition vigorously opposes those elements of this legislation which increase the HECS charges. We note that Senator Vanstone has already indicated that she may be prepared to review this legislation, so I urge the government to abandon this bill now. Do not take the House through this charade which is already damaging enrolments, particularly in the science and engineering areas and for mature aged students, only to have to come back to the House later with amendments. I urge the government to withdraw this legislation now and engage in proper consultation with universities, the academic community and students.</PARA></SPEECH>

I must point out to them, having taught in the university sector, that first preference figures are highly speculative. There have been many occasions in the past when I was teaching when I would have no idea of my student numbers until second and third preferences came in. The particular figures they are quoting are highly speculative. I feel I should point this out to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our country's higher education sector has for a long time been a bastion for research and development, and the hallowed halls of universities have been integral to underlining the knowledge and skills of the most learned minds of this country&mdash;our top scientists, our medical practitioners and average Australians who graduate with a sense of pride and achievement. The importance of the higher education sector should never be underestimated. Universities prepare students with skills and great confidence, and they make opportunities become a reality. Universities are very much a culture within themselves. From the dress, language, lectures and lifestyles, a university education is a treasured commodity which should never be bargained away or taken from anyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The higher education sector is blossoming into a competitive and marketable sector. There seems to be a move to offer students not only a quality teaching environment but also up to the minute library facilities, gymnasiums, sporting complexes and accommodation. Universities now attract not only local students but those outside the metropolitan areas&mdash;the state, the country and areas around the world. The education sector forms a very large part of our overall services sector, particularly our export sector. As the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) mentioned, Monash University leads the way in this area. Dr Ian Reinecke, pro&hyphen;vice&hyphen;chancellor at the University of Queensland, in a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The emerging full-service universities will have analysed the market structure for education, research and professional services and will know as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6128"> much as they can about their existing and likely future competitors.</PARA>
<PARA>The vice-chancellor then went on to indicate the need for universities to have a number of characteristics, including the need for service differentiation, quality use of communication infrastructure, becoming leaders in information technology, and offering targeted professional services. Just as people need to make very careful decisions about purchasing motor vehicles or houses, choosing the right university has become just as important. Universities are facing up to that challenge. Now is a great opportunity for them to make the structural changes that they have long advocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More and more of our institutions need to continuously structure and focus their operations to cater for the needs of students. The aim is to be leaders providing all-round service which will attract students, their families, friends and colleagues. The federal government understands the needs of universities and their students and has balanced this with equity and cost effectiveness which is needed to make this a very workable sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I speak with some experience in the higher education sector. As a lecturer and tutor at the Queensland University of Technology in the area of marketing, I know of the work and commitment which is placed into higher education by students, lecturers and administration. It is not easy, but it can be very rewarding. I acknowledge the fact that university life does not just revolve around students themselves. Family support and contacts made at universities form a very valuable support structure in the community. Let me take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of all those involved in the higher education sector, particularly the teaching staff who work long and endless hours, freely giving of their time for student advice and counsel after hours and on the weekends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Carseldine campus of the Queensland University of Technology is a feature of the Petrie electorate. Students can undertake at this campus Bachelor of Business courses majoring in human resource management, Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Social Science. The Queensland University of Technology is the second largest tertiary institution <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the state and educates and accommodates upwards of 16,000 full-time students and 11,000 part-time students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to see that the operating grants for Queensland institutions will be 3.6 per cent higher in 1997 than in 1996. In 1998, operating grants for Queensland will continue to grow relative to 1996, being 4.6 per cent higher than they were in 1996. Furthermore, one of the aspects of this bill, which all sides of the House should find commendable, is the commitment to research. Undoubtedly, universities have a primary responsibility for the provision of research training and for undertaking the majority of Australia's basic research. It is my understanding that further research infrastructure will be most welcome in this area. The bill demonstrates the government's commitment to research by increasing funding for Australian postgraduate awards and collaborative research by $39.3 million and research infrastructure by $90 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next three years, this government is giving an assurance for a real commitment to research in higher education&mdash;$90 million will be provided to ensure the international competitiveness of Australia's higher education research infrastructure; $9.3 million will be provided for postgraduate research training, and the additional funding will provide support for a further 100 research students; and $30 million will be provided to enhance research between universities and industry. This is a very positive step. It is very rewarding for those who place much time and effort in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would now like to speak about HECS. To provide a fairer balance in the public and private benefits from higher education this government has made a hard decision on the higher education contribution scheme, or HECS. Payment for study and the resources provided is largely accepted. That HECS can be paid up&hyphen;front or deferred are important options which this government fully supports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill, HECS will be altered to more closely reflect the cost of delivery and future earnings associated with different courses of study. The three different bands of contribution for HECS liable students will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6129"> apply. This move, in essence, will provide a much fairer and more equitable distribution across all bands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Why should we rely on non-graduate taxpayers to subsidise the cost of higher education? It was interesting to note the comments made by the member for Wills particularly in reference to Professor Chapman's comments about up-front fees. In the past many students came to me when I was teaching at the university and said that they hoped they would never have to pay back their HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the cost of delivering higher education will now be more clearly defined. There is no doubt that some university courses lead to higher paying jobs, and these are much more expensive to provide. It must also be remembered that students with a HECS debt and those involved in current courses will not be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Importantly, this government's initiative will alleviate the criticism that everyone has to pay the same fee when they attend a university. Furthermore, the move to lower the repayment threshold is another very positive step. But it must be remembered that students have a right to apply to have the HECS payments deferred where these payments would cause serious hardship. Lower income earners will not be disadvantaged through the amendment. It will actually allow students to repay their debt more quickly than under the previous provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I wish to alleviate concerns and make it clear to students and their families that existing students will not be disadvantaged. No qualified student will be prevented from entering higher education. The federal government has presented a higher education package which improves rather than substantially restructures the sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Greater diversity and choice must always be paramount and confidence in the university sector must be maintained. Current university students can be assured of no increases in the HECS charge or debt levels for existing students and HECS liable students in their current courses, as promised before the election.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A qualified student should not miss out on an opportunity to attend university just because that person is unable to pay at the time of enrolment. The government is bringing greater equity to HECS by introducing a three&hyphen;tiered system which reflects both the actual course costs and future income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's commitment to research, HECS and its other initiatives, such as introducing a new system of merit scholarships, are positives of this legislation. The new system of merit scholarships, in particular, will open wonderful opportunities for 4,000 new undergraduate students from 1997 to the year 2000. The scholarship further highlights this government's commitment to young people and to those who are disadvantaged or are from low income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is a benchmark and it is a strategy which balances the fiscal and education needs of the sector. It is a package which seeks to support and secure higher education well into the next century.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And where is the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay)? Remember him? The member for Herbert said recently that rich people are smarter than poor people and so they have smarter children. This, he said, explained the high proportion of wealthy students in universities. He said that it is a reflection of higher intelligence rather than better opportunities. That is what he said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That comment exposes, yet again, the current of elitism which runs through this government. It is an elitism which is reflected in the range of statements and bills which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6130"> have emanated from this government since its election in March. The member for Herbert's view is not a rogue view within the government. It is shared by many others. The provisions within this bill provide the evidence that it is not an isolated rogue view. It may be a subliminal view in some cases, but its effects are consistent and expose its presence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill further disadvantages already disadvantaged students and potential students from lower income backgrounds. It will deter such students from undertaking tertiary studies and reaping the benefits of tertiary qualifications. It will return privilege to the privileged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this sense, the bill is consistent with the government's ongoing verbal and legislative attack on the disadvantaged. Witness in this context the extraordinary track record of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). Witness the soft&hyphen;shoe shuffle of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in his response to the abominable views of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). The member for Oxley's rogue views are totally rejected by everyone on this side of the House, but that is not the case on the government side as they struggle to come to terms with their former colleague.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attack goes on. Witness the strategy of cutting the wages and conditions of the lowest paid in the work force in the upcoming industrial relations bill. Witness the government's consistent attacks on programs designed to create greater equality of opportunity, such as jobs training programs under Working Nation which have had an 80 per cent cut in the western suburbs of Adelaide but only a 25 per cent cut in the leafy eastern suburbs. Witness the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), who, in this bill, is slamming down the shutters on access to tertiary qualifications for young people from lower income backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this government, Australia is reverting to a two&hyphen;tiered society. The new financial imposts on students contained in this bill are inconsequential to those from high income backgrounds. That view was reinforced by the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro). The impost will make all the difference for those not enjoying the privilege of family wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increased financial burden for students will hit in three ways. First, the bill raises the HECS contribution for all new students, including very large increases for some students under the differential HECS structure. The current rate of HECS, set at $2,442, is to be replaced by a three&hyphen;tiered structure of $4,300, $4,700 and $5,500. This will raise $313 million from students over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gets worse. Second, the bill lowers the threshold at which HECS becomes repayable from the old benchmark of average male weekly earnings to the second tax threshold, and indexed thereafter to average weekly earnings. That is, HECS liability is to be repaid on incomes above $20,701 compared with the $28,495 under Labor. This will raise another $817.4 million from students and graduates over four years. That is a total of $1.3 billion to be taken from students by the government over the next four years. This measure breaks the coalition's pre&hyphen;election promise not to change the HECS rules for students already studying. It means an increased financial burden for all students&mdash;not just future students&mdash;and all graduates as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Third, the bill allows universities to charge full fees for places above the target number of funded places enabling wealthy but less able students to jump the queue. If the government, at a later date, adopts its hand&hyphen;picked audit commission's recommendation that future university funding be limited to a capped number of scholarships, properly qualified applicants may have to pay full fees or miss out altogether on a tertiary education. The bill dismantles the equity of access principle that was at the heart of Labor education policy, a principle, by the way, that was seen as an impediment by many from wealthy backgrounds with inferior scorecards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">HECS was introduced by Labor, but it was designed in a way to avoid creating barriers to participation by students from low income backgrounds. Further, the Labor government required constant monitoring of the impact of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6131"> HECS on participation by low income students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the provisions of this bill all students will face major increases ranging from 35 per cent to 125 per cent. The new financial impost means that students will have to make an assessment about the financial risk involved. Many students may make the decision to forgo an education in order to avoid a crippling debt incurred by the dramatic increase in the cost of courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the harsh reality is that repayments on the HECS debt will be required on an income of $20,701 rather than $28,495. For students from a high income background, this is not a matter of concern. Wealthy parents generally foot the bill for their children's education. Students from low income backgrounds do not have that comfort zone and they will have to reassess the risk involved for them. Under Labor, repayment was not required until the student had gained employment with an income that reflected the benefit of achieving a tertiary qualification. By lowering the income on which repayment of HECS debts is required, the government will be requiring repayments from students and graduates with incomes not reflecting the benefits of having undertaken a course of study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those affected by this change include students who fail to complete a course of study and graduates who opt for occupations which do not maximise their income producing power. Students who leave an institution without achieving a qualification will still be liable to repay debt once their income rises above the new lower threshold, even if their occupation presents little scope for pay increases above that threshold. Remember, the income on which HECS will be repayable is a very long way below average male weekly earnings. The students who are most likely not to complete a course will be those who are unable to repeat a portion of the course and those on whom there is a less family expectation that they will complete the course. In short, this is an attack on people from low income backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also adversely affected will be those who are working in low paid employment while <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> studying for a further qualification. These students will be required to repay HECS debt on their current incomes before enjoying the higher incomes that qualification may eventually bring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Others to be particularly disadvantaged include those who attain the qualification but are not able to gain work in their chosen profession. For example, as the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) would know, there are many teachers who have completed their training but are unable to find work as teachers and elect instead to work in lower paid, non-professional jobs. They will be required to repay HECS debts on incomes not reflecting their tertiary qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Still others may decide, for a range of reasons, not to maximise their income producing power. There are still people in this country who work for philanthropic reasons rather than remuneration. A lawyer, for example, may opt to work in a community legal service rather than a legal practice but he or she will be required to repay debt on a very moderate income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the new financial impost on students and graduates by this bill, how many talented young Australians will simply give up their higher education aspirations? The signs are not good, if you bother to talk to current senior secondary students in the schools in your electorate. This bill is a perfect policy reflection of the elitism of the government espoused by the member for Herbert, in that they have most disadvantaged those from low income backgrounds. For such students, the attainment of professional tertiary qualifications may never have been an expectation. It certainly would never have been regarded as a right. In fact, some students may not even know anyone with a tertiary qualification. This is something that members on the government side simply cannot comprehend. Historically, people from low income backgrounds viewed tertiary institutions as inaccessible and remote. In contrast, the privileged saw tertiary education as their right and used it to maintain their privilege and their wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, the financial accessibility was relieved and the doors of opportunity were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6132"> opened. Labor successfully encouraged students to complete high school and undertake tertiary courses. The honourable member for Sturt would be, I hope, concerned at the drop in retention rates in South Australia from over 90 to just over 60 per cent in three years of a state Brown government. At the same time, Labor used various policies to break down the inherent elitism within tertiary institutions. This was highly resented and strongly resisted by many within the institutions and within the then opposition, who believe that people from low income backgrounds have no place in tertiary institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Herbert is a representative for this view, and there are many others on the government side. This bill reflects that point of view. It reflects the cloistered, elitist views of tertiary institutions. It is a bill which puts up the bars around tertiary institutions, around tertiary qualifications and around tertiary incomes. It is a bill that turns back the clock and closes up the flowering under Labor of equality of opportunity in tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will please some. It will please those who believe that universities should revert to being the preserve of the wealthy and the privileged. It will please those who believe that extending the opportunity of higher education to people from lower income backgrounds lowers academic standards. It will please those who believe that certain high paid professions should be the preserve of the privileged, as they were before Labor turned it around. Medicine, for example, will once again become the faculty of the children of the leafy suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides further evidence that under this government this country will again become two tiered. The government is aiming to make health care two tiered by starving the public sector of funds. The work force will become two tiered by swiping away award protection for those who are most vulnerable. And education will become two tiered by this bill cutting accessibility for students from lower income backgrounds, while providing opportunities for the wealthy to jump the queue ahead of poorer, better qualified students. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this government, elitism rules. This bill epitomises the government's policy formulation since their election in March this year. So much of their policy is about exclusion. So much of their policy formulation is about punishment. All of their policy formulation reflects an elitist view. It reflects a complete remoteness from the problems and the difficulties that people from middle and especially lower incomes face. It reflects a view of the world without genuine compassion. It reflects an intent to drive a wedge through Australian society, to punish those who they do not like and to reward those from the upper echelons, from their side of town. This is a government for the privileged sector of the community, not for all of us, as they proclaimed before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, this bill is a blatant betrayal of young Australians' aspirations for fair access and participation in higher education. It breaches the solemn promises the government made to the Australian electorate. It forgoes equity, it forgoes access, it rejects inclusiveness and it promotes exclusivity. Under Labor, Australia's higher education system was internationally regarded as one of the most accessible systems in the world. And it had to be, because total enrolments in higher education grew from around 350,000 to 630,000 this year. That is some achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next four years the government aims to cut over $1.8 billion from this sector through the combination of funding cuts and these dramatically increased HECS charges. In fact, it is worse than that. Salary increases of about $300 million are not included, and what about the $2 billion in fees that universities receive from overseas students and a consequent risk to jobs of Australians because of the idiotic and unfounded comments of the member for Oxley?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the very same coalition which promised to maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities. This is the very same coalition that promised not to make changes to HECS rules after a student has begun study. Mr Deputy Speaker, we on this side of the House always knew those promises were worthless, but many in the Australian electorate believed the coalition's promises on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6133"> 2 March.

It is really pathetic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to comment on the hypocrisy of the Labor Party in trying to make the claim that because the Liberal Party has been in government for seven months we are somehow creating two societies in this country, when for 13 years the gap between the rich and poor in Australia widened very considerably, very significantly. I would also make the comment that under the Labor Party the rich got richer and the poor got poorer, but it took a Liberal&hyphen;National Party government to make changes in the budget like a surcharge on superannuation on high income earners, and cutting off the Medicare private health insurance rebate for people on high incomes and giving it to people on low and middle incomes. It was a Liberal government that did that. It was a coalition government that actually had the courage to recognise that the gap between rich and poor was widening in this country and that we should act to ensure that that did not continue. The Labor Party spent 13 years trying to pretend that it was not happening while they cosied up to big business and to big unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Port Adelaide also made some comments about the flowering of equal opportunity under Labor and financial accessibility relieved under Labor because of their changes to the higher education sector. It is a known fact that from the moment that Gough Whitlam introduced free education to Australia&mdash;or so&hyphen;called free education, because the taxpayer still was paying for it&mdash;nothing changed in the make&hyphen;up of students who have attended university. All that has happened is that some people have been subsidised outrageously for higher education over that 25&hyphen;year period and those who needed support, who needed to be looked after, were not being looked after by the Labor Party because of some ideological hang&hyphen;up about free education. The member <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6134"> for Port Adelaide says changes are now at risk because of a Liberal government, when for the years of the Whitlam government and later the 13 years of Hawke and Keating none of those changes was in fact achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Port Adelaide also made some extraordinarily banal comments about the fact that students would only be able to go into medicine from the leafy eastern suburbs of Adelaide. Perhaps he has not caught up with the government's changes, but medicine is the only faculty in which Australian students will not be able to purchase places over and above the places that are provided by the government in medical schools&mdash;other than overseas students, who will be able to continue to pay for places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if you buy the argument&mdash;which I do not and the government does not&mdash;about the rich and thick being able to send their children to university, it is actually the medical school where no positions, other than government&hyphen;funded positions and overseas&hyphen;funded positions by private students, will be available, so it is ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also tried to claim that all courses will now be filled by rich people from the eastern suburbs. Incomes, family incomes and backgrounds have made no difference and will make no difference in the future under the coalition government's changes. If you can get the scores to get into university you will attend university; it will make no difference to you whether you have funding from home or from special incomes. The government has recognised the importance, which you never did, of protecting people from low socioeconomic backgrounds, rural and remote people and indigenous people by creating 4,000 scholarships for those people to go to university; something that you never did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not wish to speak for very long on this bill as I spoke in the appropriation debate on higher education in the main committee, but as the chairman of the government Committee on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs I feel I should make some contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 13 years of attempting to create a nation in their own image, it is perhaps natural that the few remaining members of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that former ruling class shy away from change. A baker's dozen in years was enough for them to put in place their required policies, setting up a system to suit themselves. Clearly, they are in no hurry to see it dismantled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirteen years, however, was not long enough for them to complete the Faustian deal craved so desperately by those opposite. The people showed on 2 March that they were not prepared to sell their souls in return for the free ride promised by Labor. Australians do not expect a free ride; they only expect a fair go. They sensed Labor could deliver neither and so they voted for change. Now it is time to make those changes. Those opposite rue their political impotence, but believe me, their affliction is viewed as a blessing out there in the community, something they failed to understand and that was underlined by the Lindsay by&hyphen;election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time to move now to ensure that our higher education produces what it promises. The succession of Labor governments loved to use the yardsticks of access and equity and the member for Port Adelaide recognised this in his own speech. In most areas their policies on access and equity failed miserably, but especially in higher education. In that regard, ours was the vision that was embraced by the voters and I believe that the size of our majority is fair evidence of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is amusing that the Labor Party now poses as the defenders of the people after years of indifference to them. I would add that I imagine that the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and the member for Port Adelaide would agree with me on these issues, coming from that part of the Labor Party that was so out in the cold under Paul Keating in the last four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on about their shabby treatment to those in so many areas of Australian life but today I wish to confine my remarks to higher education. Here are the facts: the system has not yet collapsed despite 13 years of Labor government, but it is rickety and it certainly needs repair. At its best, it has functioned only adequately; in government Labor occasionally recognised shortcomings in the system, particularly in the 1980s, but it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6135"> never took responsibility for the shortcomings that it caused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So&hyphen;called free education did not produce higher education for all, merely a larger bill for the nation's learning. Then the Labor government introduced HECS, a fall back second&hyphen;best option to the previously utopian one preferred by the short&hyphen;lived Whitlam government. Despite HECS, education is still, in the main, sponsored by the taxpayers. If the system produces qualified people who work in Australia's interest then everyone benefits. The timing and size of that repayment is dependent on graduates becoming productive; they must be qualified and the work force must be capable of absorbing them. The Labor Party did little to ensure either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That academic excellence meant little to Labor members was clearly demonstrated when they introduced full fees for postgraduate studies. Rather than rewarding the ambitious and the excellent, those who would in the longer term be able to contribute more to Australia, they treated them as elitists and made it more difficult for them. At the same time, while they expanded the tertiary education sector massively they reduced per capita funding for students. Education was clearly not their goal; rather, their goal was a reduction in unemployment queues with babies and sitters posing as students and academics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is about making the term `the clever country' mean something genuine. This bill heralds much needed changes in attitude to, and the direction of, higher education. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) has worked diligently in bringing all this together. She has consulted with many people, sought many opinions, and sadly been subjected to many more. Unlike her recent predecessors, she has the ideas and the conviction to bring about dividends for and from the system. Senator Vanstone has responsibility for portfolios that are vital to Australia's future. It is a shame that some are placing politics above people in attempting to block her initiatives.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must sadden some of the old former Labor reformers to see those opposite, like Horatio on the bridge, staunchly defending a system that fails to measure up in today's competitive environment. Education, like most things these days, comes at a cost. We only get what we pay for. Polls have shown that Australians are happy to dig deep for something that they believe in. There has been a preparedness amongst the Australian people to pay more for a better health system, to pay for a gun buy&hyphen;back system, and some have offered to throw money even at the ABC because they believe in its importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because we believe education really matters, because we believe it should be more than merely a job alternative, we are asking students to contribute a little more. Our aim is to improve the system so that increased input will mean increased output. It is quite equitable to ask those students taking specialised courses to pay a little more than those who are taking general studies. The top 20 per cent of households derive more than five times the benefit from education than the bottom 20 per cent of households. Those students who will ultimately join the ranks of the very high income earners are subsidised by all the taxpayers, whether they are white collar or blue collar, rich or poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our changes to HECS are fair. They will not affect students already undertaking a university course, as was promised in the last election. The previous government showed no such courtesy to students, and to me as a HECS payer, when they retrospectively increased HECS three times in the last parliament. The previous government also introduced fees for students from overseas countries for places over and above government provided places. They did not, however, allow Australians the same opportunity to participate in that scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government's initiative to allow Australians to purchase a university place will not, despite the murmurs of the nay sayers, including the members opposite, lead to thick young people from rich families receiving preference over any other. Rather it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6136"> will increase the scope for students to take courses in which they have an interest and it will bring in money to the system. HECS paying students will not be disadvantaged in the least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an interesting statistic which you might like to add to your next speech. If universities attract only one per cent additional undergraduate student load in 1997, if they increase it by one per cent of fee paying undergraduates, they will raise another $17 million in income. Imagine, if they get their full 25 per cent, how much money that will mean for universities in terms of revenue. One of the challenges of the new global economy is to be good enough to compete with the best. Our academic institutions must cut the mustard with the very best universities around the world. It is not enough to provide higher education, we must remove duplication. We must cut the waste, we must strive for excellence and ultimately be the best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be looking to the areas in which we can excel. It seems to me that with our extraordinary natural wealth in the mining area and so on we should be leading the world in training students for that field. Instead, people are travelling overseas to be trained in that field. Why should Australians have to venture overseas to obtain the best qualifications? We often force those students to go looking for gold, metaphorically speaking, and complain when they do not come back. While our undergraduate degrees are as valuable as most on this planet, it is the postgraduate level where we fall behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of that we will be funding an additional 100 postgraduate awards at a cost of $9.3 million over the next three years. We will be providing another $30 million for collaborative research grants to foster links between our universities and the industrial sector and we will provide $90 million for research and for investment in new equipment for facilities. Commonwealth funding for higher education operating grants and research will increase by $50 million next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Universities are being asked to find a one per cent saving this year. I am disappointed that the member for Port Adelaide is leaving during this debate, having indicated that he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wished to listen to my speech so that he could improve his future ones. But to continue, universities must plan and budget so that they can find another 4c in the dollar by 1999. These are hardly draconian measures, especially at a time when Australians are being asked to make sacrifices for the greater national good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we favour moving to more of a user&hyphen;pays system, we have not forgotten the disadvantaged, as I said earlier when I mentioned the 4,000 HECS&hyphen;free scholarships. I am amazed that the members of the Australian Labor Party who envelop themselves in the shroud of social justice&mdash;particularly the member for Melbourne&mdash;could object to this fair and reasonable bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then again, nothing surprises me anymore about the Labor Party, a party that is down, with its collective neck pinned to the floor by the heavy boot of its union bosses. If the Labor Party is to recover, it needs to listen to the people, not to special interest groups. The Lindsay by&hyphen;election proved that people have still not found a place in their hearts for the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As long as Labor continues to pull cynical stunts like running failed ex&hyphen;ministers in the seat of Lindsay, a man who had been rejected only months earlier by the electorate, it will remain locked out. As long as members of the Labor Party are obstructionist, they must be content to remain on the outside, mere spectators to the passing parade.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill is of great importance to me. As a student, I was fortunate to be in the very first intake in 1974 and was able to go to university without the burden of fees and with assistance from the tertiary education assistance scheme, or TEAS as it was called&mdash;the forerunner to Austudy. Many people that I went to university with probably would not have been there without help from the changes initiated by the Whitlam government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My parents were not wealthy, but given their very strong commitment to my education, I suspect that they would have virtually starved in order to pay my fees, had that been necessary. Many people in society at that time <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6137"> did not have the option of going to university because of the arrangements under the Liberal government, which meant that if they were unable to get one of the limited number of Commonwealth scholarships, and they were unable to afford the fees for university, they simply did not go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It worries me a great deal how, even under the arrangements that were put in place by the former Labor government, students can manage their financial obligations when they are going to university. It took me quite a number of years to clear the debts that I accumulated when I was at university, and I did not have HECS to worry about. It greatly troubles me that students these days, even under Labor's arrangements, have considerable difficulty coping with the HECS burden after they leave university, as well as with the debts that inevitably accumulate throughout that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a background to this debate, it is important to go through the record of Labor in office. That record is sometimes misrepresented, not only by people within the coalition, but also by people in the student political arena who are further to the left of the Labor Party. Although I was very troubled by some of those initiatives, and I even opposed some of them at the time, retrospectively, Labor's performance in overall terms was excellent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In real dollar terms, funding for the higher education sector increased by 70 per cent over the period that Labor was in office. Even if this is taken on an equivalent full&hyphen;time student unit basis&mdash;an EFTSU basis&mdash;there was a slight increase in funding per student. The real story is in those two figures, and it is that Labor massively expanded the higher education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) made some fleeting references to access and equity and alleged that Labor had failed on that front. The massive increase in the number of young people and mature aged students who gained access to higher education under Labor shows how fallacious his comments are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to estimate the true magnitude of this, you only need to look at the comparison <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> between when I left university back in the early 1980s and now. When I left university there were roughly about 90,000 Australians who were in receipt of TEAS, the forerunner to Austudy. The amount of money that was spent from the federal budget on TEAS was about $150 million. That was towards the end of the Fraser government's period in office. Now that amount is approaching $1 billion. From $150 million to $1 billion, even when that is reduced to be in constant prices, is still a massive increase. The number of recipients is over 250,000. That is the outcome of 13 years of dedicated effort by a Labor government to ensure that access to higher education is broadened. It has expanded enormously. As a result of that, participation, in numerical terms, in higher education has virtually doubled over that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, the HECS system, in retrospect, was probably a justified change. At the time I was not in support of the HECS system. I believed that it would function as a barrier to participation and that particular groups of students, particularly people from lower income backgrounds, would be disadvantaged as a result of it. There has been some study of the operation of the HECS system on that front and there is some evidence to suggest that, on the margins, it has operated as a disincentive to some students to participate in the higher education system. But, generally speaking, that disincentive factor has been relatively limited and certainly much less than I expected at the time when the debate was occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the broader context of massively expanding the system and ensuring that the quantity of people in our society who can gain access to higher education is enormously increased, then the HECS system, I think, was justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The age&hyphen;old debate that has been revived by the member for Sturt today about the question of equity and about the fact that the predominance of people in higher education, both prior to the Whitlam government and subsequently, has been disproportionately people of a wealthier background, really has one missing part in it. That is, in order to achieve some degree of equity in the higher education system, it is necessary to remove barriers to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6138"> participation by people from lower income backgrounds. But that by itself is not sufficient. The great fallacy in this debate is the notion that because these barriers were removed by the Whitlam government and there was no sudden dramatic change in the socioeconomic mix of people participating in higher education, somehow this was an inappropriate approach and that we should go back to the old days of major financial barriers to participation. The fact is that the reasons why people participate are more comprehensive and more complex than just financial barriers such as being required to pay fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the solution to these problems is not to reinstitute fees. It is not to put the barriers back. The solutions are to do other things as well. Therefore, it is absurd to argue that, because these changes by themselves have not brought about a revolution in participation, at least proportionally, therefore they should be removed. Even though that revolution did not occur on a proportionate basis, we must remember that on a strict aggregate basis&mdash;on a numerical basis&mdash;there has been a revolution in participation simply because the total percentage of particular age groups, the 18 to 24 age group most obviously, that does now participate in higher education has increased enormously. That, by definition, brings within its ambit a much larger number of people of middle and lower income backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the changes that have been put forward in this legislation by the government. There are three key changes on the HECS front and one or two others that are ancillary changes. The first is that the single rate of HECS of $2,442 will be replaced by a three&hyphen;tier rate. That starts at $3,300 per year, moves up to a second level of $4,700&hyphen;odd per year and then the highest level of $5,500, which depends on which particular course you are doing. The important thing to recognise here is that, unlike some of the criticisms that were levelled at the former uniform rate of $2,400&hyphen;odd, these rates do not reflect the cost of individual courses to the taxpayer. They appear to be based&mdash;and it is a very crude basis at best&mdash;on the anticipated earnings that individuals will achieve as a result of doing those particular courses. Law, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which is relatively cheap to teach, is in the highest group. But science and engineering, which are more expensive, by definition, to teach than law and for which the taxpayer pays more per individual student than in the case of law, are in the second group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second change that has occurred is that the repayment threshold has been reduced from $28,495 to $20,701. In other words, after you have completed your course&mdash;if you are fortunate enough to have completed your course&mdash;you start repaying your HECS as soon as your annual income hits above $20,000; in effect, as soon as you get a full&hyphen;time job. That is, effectively, the nature of it. There is some full&hyphen;time employment around these days below $20,000 a year, of course; but, as a proportion of the total, it is fairly limited. The third key part of the change is to permit universities to charge full fees for additional places&mdash;for people who are unable to get in in the normal way&mdash;up to the equivalent of 25 per cent of HECS linked places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some additional factors that have been put into the changes by the government, for example, the 4,000 scholarships&mdash;starting off in this financial year as 1,000 scholarships, building up year by year to 4,000&mdash;which will eliminate the need for 4,000 people from low income backgrounds to pay HECS. It is important to point out that those 4,000 are roughly 0.6 per cent of the total current enrolments in higher education. To trumpet that as some sort of magnificent equity initiative really is a joke. It is a very tiny, very limited initiative. It really takes you back to the old Menzies Liberal approach, which was `We are going to have an elite system for the young people from better&hyphen;off families from the eastern suburbs of Melbourne and those sorts of areas. We will let in a small proportion of the deserving poor, the very bright working class. We will give them a help up. But we do not really want the vast mass of people from lower socioeconomic background areas there.' That is really what all this is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you add to this a 4.9 per cent cut in funding for the higher education sector&mdash;which, when you put all of these things together, amounts to about $2 billion less <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6139"> from the federal government for the sector over the next four years&mdash;what you get is an overall picture of withdrawal of government from provision of higher education, withdrawal of government from ensuring that the largest number of people in our community that we can possibly manage get skills, get a decent education and are able to contribute to a different society and a much more vibrant economy based on high skills, high knowledge and sophisticated manufacturing and service industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other changes associated with this legislation. For example one of the keys changes in Austudy&mdash;I remember the impact of it very well, because I have been through it as a student&mdash;is to increase from 22 to 25 the threshold age when a person can be deemed to be independent of their parents. Labor, to its great credit, reduced that threshold from 25 to 22 years of age. The government is reinstating that threshold, so that you are now deemed to be dependent upon your parents until the age of 25. What is even more ludicrous about it is that it starts at the commencement of a course and continues throughout that course. So, if you start doing medicine at the age of 24, you are still deemed to be dependent upon your parents almost to the age of 30. There probably are some people out there who are still  dependent on their parents up to that age, but I doubt if there are very many. Yet the government is going to deem that to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all part of excluding from the system people who are not well off. It does not matter if a person who is from a wealthy background continues to be deemed to be dependent upon their parents. That does not matter to them because they have got money to draw on from that source if they need it. But where it does very much matter is for somebody who is genuinely independent but struggles to be able to prove that under the very restrictive criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these changes you can see the resonance of the Fraser government's approach, the pea-and-thimble stuff: `This is all wonderful, it is equitable and it is more expenditure.' I remember very well that in 1976 Malcolm Fraser increased the level of TEAS from $31 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to $46 per week, but at the same time he managed to drastically reduce the total amount of money being spent on it by changing the criteria, so a lot fewer people were actually eligible for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a major breach of promise by this government with respect to the higher education sector&mdash;and, incidentally, yet another breach of promise in respect of the commitment not to increase taxes. HECS ultimately is a tax. It is a charge; it is a tax; it is being increased, contrary to the commitment made by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of these changes will be, first, to alter radically the equation that confronts a person about to enter higher education. There are substantial financial risks involved and they are being made more substantial. Although it is assumed that higher education in certain courses automatically leads to wealth or high incomes, that is not necessarily the case, particularly when repayments will now start above the income of $20,000. That illustrates just how absurd this assumption is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many areas where people end up in employment that is not particularly remunerative, after having completed courses such as science, law or arts. As the expression of some sort of equity notion, this legislation is clearly absurd. Like all good conservative governments, this government runs away from the obvious. The obvious is that if you think that people on higher incomes should contribute more to the collective costs of society then it is through the taxation system that you do that. You do not use a random, blunt instrument on people, some of whom may achieve substantially higher incomes&mdash;but many of whom will not&mdash;as a result of the education that you are providing to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provision for full fee places to be offered to people who are not able to get in by the normal course process will inevitably erode over time the number of ordinary HECS payment places that are there for students. Universities will naturally be wanting to get more people on a full fee basis; they will naturally push to get more of those students there. The government, particularly this conservative government, will in consequence allow the number of HECS payment places to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6140"> erode. Bit by bit, we will see precisely what the honourable member for Sturt has denied will occur, namely, that people will be able to get in because they have got money and not on merit. More and more people who should get in on merit will be excluded because they do not have money. We will be back to the bad old days of the wealthy, effectively, buying their way in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) for providing some of the details that have been reported in the media over the last few weeks. It is very significant that we are already seeing drastic reductions in enrolments and drastic reductions in first preferences. The honourable member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) was quite right in saying that first preferences will not necessarily always tell you of final outcomes. There will be variations. Nonetheless it is very disturbing to see, for example, the preferences in the mature age student enrolment in Victoria drop from 24,000-odd to 21,000. It is very disturbing to see the serious decline in the number of people expressing a preference for science and related courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time may indicate that these concerns are unjustified, but the initial evidence is not good. The initial evidence suggests that the changes that are occurring in the system are clearly deterring a substantial number of people from entering higher education or from entering particular courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final aspect of the legislation, a most disturbing aspect, concerns Australia's economic future. One of the great achievements of the Hawke and Keating governments was the emphasis on the clever country&mdash;the emphasis on shifting away from our traditional reliance on digging things out of the ground and sending them overseas, earning enormous wealth from that and redistributing it. It is essential for our future that we produce both sophisticated manufactures and services and are able to diversify our economic base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are already exporting roughly $1 billion worth of education services and that could rise to $3 billion within a matter of five to 10 years if we can continue on the path that we are on. Also, higher education is a critical <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> underpinning for our sophisticated manufacturing capacity and our capacity to deliver a range of other services. Already we are earning substantial amounts by delivering legal services in Asia, and that has enormous potential to grow. This legislation is all part of, ultimately, a mindless, backward looking, `back to the 50s' agenda that the coalition seems unable to escape from. There are no intelligent conservatives left any more, it seems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We keep the diesel fuel rebate, we look after the farmers and the miners and the good traditional producers of Australia's export income and so forth, but we knock off the bounties for fast ferries, even though that is now producing nearly half a billion dollars a year worth of export income. We knock over research and development assistance, we get rid of a whole range of industry policy initiatives, targeted industry initiatives, and just simply go back to the past. These changes in higher education are all part of that overall pattern&mdash;back to the 1950s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder that organisations like the Heavy Engineering Manufacturing Association are already complaining vociferously about the orientation of this government which has no sense of Australia's future economic role, which has no sense of the imperatives in world trade patterns that are pushing us more and more, if we want to stay a first world nation with a high living standard, into ensuring that we are competitive and have a strong product to sell in areas like high tech manufacturing and services. What we are now seeing is a very serious disincentive to study in all of the areas that are going to provide the base for our capacity to fulfil that promise in those areas. So it is being undermined and the structure of the Australian economy is being undermined and sent backwards in the long term on all of these fronts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final concern I have is that this is yet one more step in an overall process in our society of atomisation, of user pays, of individualisation, of deconstructing everything that occurs in our society down to individual transactions, individual obligations, so that there is no social obligation, there is no such <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6141"> thing as society&mdash;as Margaret Thatcher once famously said&mdash;and that every transaction can be deconstructed, can be disaggregated down to its component parts and charged according to market imperatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is another step on the road to ultimate privatisation of the higher education sector. It is another step on the road to a reduction in total participation in the higher education sector, as we are already seeing, and it is another major step on the road to reducing our long&hyphen;term capacity to compete internationally. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (1.52 p.m.)&mdash;I rise to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. Just to follow on from the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), I would like to make one or two comments about things which he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, he said that this government has no sense of a future economic role for Australia. I must say that is rather laughable, considering the circumstances in which the government of which he was a part left this country on 2 March this year. When the new government came into parliament this time, we found that there was this huge debt which Australia had to work out how to fund. For members of the opposition to come in here and say that this government has no sense of a future economic role for Australia is an absolute joke. This government did not create the problems of huge debt, of a huge overburden on future generations of this country, for our children, for our grandchildren. We did not create that debt but we are determined to take responsibility for doing something about it. Not only that, the previous government had no plan for Australia in regard to providing for services such as higher education, and other areas of course, as well as no clear plan as to how you raise the finances to fund those services to our young people. There was no plan from the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have a plan to do this. It is very interesting, in regard to this debate on higher education, that essentially what the minister has set about doing in this legislation is to put forward a coherent, integrated strategy which balances up our fiscal policy, or raising the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> money in this country, as well as providing for education. The equation has got two sides and it has to be balanced up. The previous government was happy to spend. It was a `put it on the Bankcard' mentality, and let tomorrow take care of itself. This government has got a more prudent management strategy in which we are prepared to address how we raise the finance and balance up the budget. We are here to provide for services for our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of comment so far in this debate that the higher education sector is missing out. I want to say that in the electorate I come from, 70 per cent of our young people do not get the opportunity of going to university. Governments do not put very much money into the year 10 student or the year 12 student who leaves, goes out and starts to operate in private enterprise or in business. They get no help at all and that is 40 per cent of my young people. Another 30 per cent of my young people do get some assistance through TAFE education but not to the same extent as those going to university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying here is that those people who do get the opportunity of going on to university should make a contribution. We did not bring in the HECS charge; it has been agreed by both sides of government that HECS is a way of financing higher education and providing greater opportunities for more people to go on to higher education. We do have to fund it some way. We are moving at the margins for sure to increase HECS, but that is not the fundamental reason which prevents young people from getting to university. The real difficulty is in regional Australia and I know the Deputy Speaker, the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) would also know that there are students from his area and my electorate for whom the great trouble is the level of Austudy which is provided to get them into university. That is the biggest barrier and one of the barriers there is the cut&hyphen;off point for eligibility for living away from home. It is very difficult for a family earning gross about $40,000 who want to get two of their students into university from regional Australia&mdash;even more difficult if they have got three students.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6142">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know several families who will have three students in university, or who want to go to university next year, and they will find it extremely difficult to fund $30,000 net out of a total income package of around about $45,000 or $46,000. You have got to take tax off that $47,000 and then they have got to fund another $30,000&mdash;about $10,000 per student&mdash;to go from regional Australia into a university city or town. It is an enormous problem for young people in regional Australia. It is an area which we have to look at and where we have to make sure that we establish a mechanism where students from regional Australia can actually have the same opportunity of getting into universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect to this legislation which is very important is the amount of research funding which we are providing. In that area of Australian postgraduate awards and the collaborative research, the amount of funding is going to be increased by $39.3 million. Not only that, research infrastructure will be increased by $90 million. The previous speaker in this debate, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) was saying that we are not a government looking towards the future. This certainly contradicts that. Here is the evidence that this government is interested in the future and ensuring that there is financial assistance going into research; and research is one of those areas which is definitely forward looking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to what the member was saying&mdash;that we are not interested in research in the manufacturing area&mdash;these research projects no doubt help quite remarkably the amount of research which is undertaken in the technological area within the country. Not only that, we are going to provide 4,000 scholarships which will exempt students from paying HECS. There will be 4,000 scholarships which will be called merit equity scholarships. These will certainly help people from regional and rural Australia. They will help indigenous young people have an opportunity of going to university and will minimise the impact of having to pay HECS because these students will be exempt from that. This is important to provide for those students on a merit basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that, $72 million of funding will be provided in this legislation to ensure that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indigenous people in higher education are catered for. That is a substantial amount of money provided in this act of the bill before the House.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Mr GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer him to today's balance of payments figures, which show that capital imports are down 15 per cent in the first three months of this year, compared with the final three months of the last financial year. Given this slowing in capital imports and hence business investment in plant and equipment, does the Treasurer accept that this is a sign that investment will be weaker than forecast in the budget? Don't these figures mean fewer jobs and even more unemployment?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6142" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested by the prelude to that question because, in seasonally adjusted terms, capital goods rose $62 million or four per cent in the figures that were announced today. I do not know who wrote the question or how you tried to manipulate the figures, but as today's balance of payments show on page 3 regarding merchandise imports in seasonally adjusted terms, `Capital goods rose $62 million or four per cent to $1,507 million.' I think we can do away with the whole question on that basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than do that, I want to come to the gist of the question and say something about today's balance of payments figures. The current account deficit announced for September 1996 today was $1.7 billion, a higher figure than expected, although the current account deficit this year has improved as against 1995 when Australia had the highest current account deficit in the industrialised world&mdash;worse than Mexico.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was a long&hyphen;term development over 13 years of Labor government, which drove net <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6143"> foreign debt from about $23 billion up to around $180 billion and left us with a permanent deficit on the current account required to service foreign debt. You would see in today's figures the current account deficit of $1.7 billion, but the net income deficit was $1.76 billion. In other words, we have a permanent current account deficit, which is the cost of servicing the foreign debt which was built up over the 13 failed years of Labor Keating government. As a result, we have that permanent pressure in relation to our current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as this problem built up over a long period of time, this problem will take numbers of years to fix. And in relation to the fixing of our current account deficit, it is the question of savings that must be addressed. At the heart of the problem of Australia's current account deficit is our savings problem. It is bridging that savings problem that is going to give us the structural improvement in the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason this government set on a course of balancing Australia's budget was to deal with savings, to make sure that the Commonwealth government got back in the business of savings. After five years of growth, our predecessors had accumulated $70 billion worth of deficits in underlying terms&mdash;$70 billion worth of dissavings over the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As if that were not bad enough, having created the problem and failed to fix it, we now find in opposition they are trying to sabotage the solution, doing whatever they can to try to knock off the savings measures that this government put in place.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the case of the member for Hotham, it is a sabotaging of savings by making it optional for high income earners to pay tax. He is the one who has been grabbed by the tax avoidance industry, who is single&hyphen;handedly coming around, trying to re&hyphen;introduce the R&amp;D tax concessions, a guaranteed return for a tax break. And we know who is putting the pressure on the member for Hotham to bring those tax concessions back: all of the people he was dealing with back in his days as ACTU president.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make it entirely clear that it is the member for Hotham who is driving the re-introduction of tax concessions in relation to R&amp;D syndicates, just part of the proposals of the Labor opposition to try to knock off, over four years, $19 billion worth of savings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Is the minister aware of reports today that Singaporean troops who are guests of the Australian defence forces at the Shoalwater Bay training area have been physically and racially abused, including a situation in which one Singaporean officer has been required to seek medical treatment and in which two Singaporean women have been pelted with eggs and spat upon? Will the minister provide the House with details of these incidents, and what is the minister's response to the reports?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HT4">Mr McLACHLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I have seen the media reports. I am advised that a number of incidents are alleged to have occurred during the Singaporean deployment, including two of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6144"> assault and robbery, one of assault, one of throwing projectiles at a female and five of verbal abuse. However, I understand that, of the 51 incidents reported to the police during the time of the Singaporean deployment, only two involved our visitors. At this stage one of those incidents is being investigated by the police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever the cause, we regard any incidents like this as an abomination and extremely regrettable. Those armed forces personnel who were the subject of these unfortunate incidents were on leave at Rockhampton, as you know extremely well, from an exercise that has been conducted up there for some time now in the Shoalwater Bay training area. We conduct a number of those exercises with our neighbours from PNG, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines and elsewhere. Those activities have been highly successful. They promote mutual confidence, which is essential to regional stability and peace in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that the Singapore contingent for the exercise comprised some 400 personnel. They were personnel quartered in Rockhampton as well as 2,000 personnel who were out at Shoalwater Bay, some of whom came into Rockhampton at the end of the exercise. We have found that the behaviour of those visiting friends has been exemplary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reaction of the local community has been in the main most welcoming. An example of this is that on the weekend when two of those incidents that were mentioned were alleged to have occurred, some 15,000 residents went to two concerts conducted by the Singapore armed forces concert company. So obviously relationships are very good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We provide a very high level of support to the Singapore armed services through a wide range of training facilities. They will now increase because, in addition to training at Pearce and other exercises of the sort I have just mentioned, we have recently signed several major agreements and understandings with Singapore, including one signed by Dr Tony Tan and myself on the 21st of this month&mdash;Dr Tan is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence&mdash;for the conducting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of helicopter training at Oakey.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs why he has written to the Thai paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Nation</EMPHASIS> .

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Longman for his question. I did indeed write yesterday to the editor of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Nation</EMPHASIS>  newspaper in Thailand because I thought an editorial that that newspaper had published in the last few days was totally <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6145"> wrong, was ignorant and was offensive to Australians. It is important that I, in my capacity as the foreign minister, correct the record when the record is so blatantly wrong. I have not, of course, responded to wire service reports from AAP and AFP and others or reports written by Australian stringers for Asian newspapers, but where an editorial was written in Thailand in such offensive terms I thought it was important that the government's position and, indeed, Australia's position was clarified for the readers of that newspaper. I will continue to do that if newspapers of any kind deliberately misrepresent or even inadvertently misrepresent the position of the Australian government and the mainstream of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made the point&mdash;and I make it more generally too, not just in the context of that letter but more broadly in the context of our engagement with our region&mdash;that this government unequivocally repudiates racism. It has done so since it was elected and as an opposition we did so as well. So this government unreservedly repudiates all forms of racism. We will not have a bar of it. That statement is clear and absolutely unequivocal. On this side of House, as I believe most members of the House do, we find racism little short of repugnant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I would make is that we have a rock solid commitment to a non-discriminatory immigration policy. We are not intending to change the law, we are not intending to change our policy and we are not intending to change our commitment. It is the government that makes policies, not Independents or others out there in the broader community. It is the government in the end that makes the policy. The government has made it clear that it will not stand for racism and that it will not even contemplate a discriminatory immigration policy. I have made that point absolutely clear wherever it has been raised in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only did I do so in the last day in a letter to a Thai newspaper which had made such false comments about Australia and the Australian government, but I did so in a speech I made in Malaysia on my first visit to Asia after this controversy erupted in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, upon coming to office, set about cleaning up a very considerable mess that was in the department at that stage.

This aspect of the proposed legislation merely confirmed the decision made by the previous government and announced in the innovation statement of 6 December.

The 3 June announcements were a clarification of an announcement that had been made under the Labor government to prevent `grave digging' claims. The point about `grave digging' claims is that these were claims which were right back into 1992&hyphen;93.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HQ5">Mr FAHEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Honourable members would no doubt be aware that the National Commission of Audit report released in June of this year identified accrued Common <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> wealth unfunded liability in respect of public sector superannuation schemes of nearly $70 billion. Superannuation schemes that contributed to that unfunded liability included Commonwealth employee schemes, defence personnel, parliamentarians and judges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been the Commonwealth practice&mdash;as I am sure all honourable members would know&mdash;for several decades now not to set aside money in respect of the liabilities accruing during the working lives of eligible employees. While there is no question that the Commonwealth has the capacity to meet its liability in future years, the National Commission of Audit did suggest that the Commonwealth should in future fund its employer superannuation liability as it accrues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Commission of Audit also identified the need to examine the replacement of its defined benefit superannuation schemes with accumulation schemes. It did not propose that the total value of overall remuneration packages should be reduced but that Commonwealth employees should be treated in a similar way to the broader work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two matters relating to parliamentarians' superannuation benefits which I believe warrant further comment. The first relates to entitlements of former members of parliament to access benefits before age 55. It is a legitimate question to ask why members of parliament should have different provisions from all other members of the public&mdash;that is, relating to access before age 55.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter relates to what is known as double dipping, where former members of parliament continue to draw a percentage of their annuity even when they take on full&hyphen;time employment in some capacity with the Commonwealth some time after leaving parliament. On this matter, I see merit in the annuity being frozen during the period of post&hyphen;parliament full&hyphen;time employment with the Commonwealth. The matter is on the agenda for the next meeting of the trustees of the parliamentary retirement allowance trust shortly.</PARA>

That is around 65 calls per hour. During 1995, one of these organisations alone received 3,000 calls from young people expressing suicidal tendencies and, on average, there were two calls per day received where there was an emergency relating to self&hyphen;harming actions which needed to be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This funding is in addition to two other projects announced by the government relating to youth suicide.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Canning for her question. She has had a long and deep interest in this matter of getting literacy skills to young people in her electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, I announced key findings by the Australian Council for Educational Research which showed that 30 per cent of 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in Year 9 in Australia had unsatisfactory reading skills. There had been a stream of anecdotal evidence to this effect over quite a number of years but I think it is fair to say that the findings I announced last week have shocked many in the community. They have certainly produced very strong support throughout the community for the government's determination to address literacy as a matter of national priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons for the strength of the community reaction on this matter has been the failure of the previous Labor government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6151"> to tell people the facts about the literacy situation in this country. For 13 years the previous government had access to key data. The community could have been informed. These facts could have been made available to parents, to small business, and to members of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The data that I announced existed in the longitudinal studies of Australian youth. There were surveys taken in 1975, 1980, 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1995. At any point over the term of the previous Labor government this data could have been analysed and the Australian community could have been informed about the state of literacy of young Australians. Effective policies could then have been put in place to address the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, the Labor Party made itself, you would have to say, the compliant partner of the cult of secrecy to conceal this information from the community. It was, of course, their mates in the teacher unions, for whom they have been the persistent mouthpiece in this parliament, which encouraged them to conceal this information from parents and the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has now directed that this crucial body of data be analysed and that Australian parents be told what it shows. What it shows, among other disturbing findings, is that the reading comprehension of Australian boys of 14 has actually declined over the last 20 years. The proportion with inadequate skills rose from 30 to 35 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It shows that, despite the enormous amount of empty rhetoric over the last 13 years, there has been no improvement in the reading skills amongst students from homes where English is not the first language. Overall, it shows that the percentage of Year 9 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who failed to attain these basic skills was 28 per cent in 1975 and 30 per cent in 1995, despite the expenditure of over $1 billion on disadvantaged schools programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Over the next four years the government will be spending over $635 million on its broadbanded literacy program. I can assure the members of this House and Australian parents that this government is determined that this money will be spent in a way where the results from its expenditure will be moni tored closely. We will ensure that young people who are seeking to be assisted by this expenditure actually will be assisted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth will be working very closely with the states, teachers, the Australian Primary Principals Association, parents and communities to make sure that the proper priority will be given at last to providing young Australians with the foundations for life&mdash;that is, good literacy skills.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I draw the minister's attention to the fact that wool growers throughout Australia, and in my electorate of Wannon in particular, are increasingly concerned about the continuing sluggish state of the wool market, which means for most that they are producing wool at a loss or at best they break even. My first question is: what is being done to arrest this continuing slump in the market? Secondly, what plans does the government have to restore the wool industry to one of the world's leading fibre producers?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question, and I understand it is of real concern to him and to many other members in this place. There have been some six years now during which wool growers have been producing at below the cost of production. There is no doubt that it is doing immense damage not only to those growers in the industry but also to the rural communities <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that they come from, and it is of real concern I am sure to all members in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many parts of Australia where there are no viable options except that of growing wool, and entire communities are dependent upon that industry. Following the even further slide into despair in terms of prices last year, on coming to government I found myself confronted by a very dispirited and divided industry, one uncertain about how to grapple with its major problems, which it saw as the management of the stockpile and the creation of further demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I set about doing everything that I could to restore some sense of unity and purpose in the industry, because I saw that unity and that sense of purpose as being prerequisites to tackling the questions that will determine whether or not the industry has a future. I initiated two round tables involving growers, industry leaders, buyers, end users and retailers&mdash;a wide cross&hyphen;section of industry thinkers, movers and shakers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of their deliberations and as a result of the way in which the fixed released schedule had reduced the very frightening debt the industry was facing a couple of years ago to below $1 billion today and the fact that the stockpile is now down to below two million bales, we established that there was freedom to move in the management of the stockpile. This morning I brought legislation into this place which reflects that new found freedom. From January next year there will be a relaxing of the fixed release schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to place on record my appreciation of the cooperation of my opposite number&mdash;Senator Bob Collins&mdash;in this matter. He has gone out of his way to assure us that he will expedite the passage of the legislation to allow for an early start&hyphen;up date next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Attention now switches to the real matters of increasing demand, which is absolutely critical to securing the prosperity of the industry in the future. We do face major problems there. The under&hyphen;40s in our major customer nations have a very low consciousness of the desirable qualities of wool. They think of it as expensive and hard to look after, although they think of it as a natural product. We have to turn that around. It is in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6154"> national interest. This is a multibillion dollar industry. Major efforts will be made in the next little while to focus carefully on market promotion and how it is done, ensuring that we have sufficient resources to do so.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the government appropriately should be involved, we will be; where not, we will not be. In many ways it is now a question of industry leadership picking up the ball and running with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do make a couple of observations. We have just signed a very valuable trade agreement with Mexico. The Minister for Trade, Minister Fischer, and the minister for economic affairs for Mexico, Minister Blanco, have agreed to an arrangement whereby we export tops and, with it, expertise from this country to Mexico. There will be no tariffs applying to that movement of wool. They will value&hyphen;add it and re&hyphen;export it to America without any tariffs being imposed under the NAFTA free trade agreement. Those sorts of agreements offer very much the way forward for the Australian wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one final point I would make is that we are exploring options for the early recovery by growers of their equity in the stockpile. There is likely to be somewhere between $600 million and $900 million to be recovered. We will look at all options for returning that to growers as early as possible. I know that on this matter all members in this place look forward to an early recovery for this very hard pressed industry, the people in it and the communities that depend on it.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<ANSWER PAGE="6154" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. The Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum of last week was a highly successful exercise for both Australia and Indonesia. On this occasion, we brought a large group of business delegates to participate in the discussions in order to take up the opportunity of meeting their counterparts in Indonesia and also to meet senior Indonesian government ministers and bureaucrats. This was something that they very much appreciated and was an initiative of this particular forum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in the transport sector, there were a number of very valuable and significant outcomes from the discussions. For example, we agreed between ourselves and the Indonesian minister, Dr Haryanto, that we would establish aviation services within AIDA&mdash;the Australia&hyphen;Indonesia Development Area&mdash;and that Australia would participate in the provision of aviation services within AIDA and would set up points within northern Australia from which aviation services can operate. This will be very valuable for both Indonesia and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also agreed that Australia would take up the training of air traffic controllers. Very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6155"> significant numbers of air traffic controllers will be trained by Australian air traffic controllers and that will help improve air traffic control services within Indonesia, and between Indonesia and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also be training Indonesian seafarers in Australia. Also, we have agreed to train the trainers in road safety skills. This is something that Indonesia was particularly interested in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a country made up of some 17,500 islands, as Indonesia is, the development of fast ferry services is important to the development of the economies of those islands. Australia is at the leading edge of technology in the development of fast ferries. We have opened up opportunities for Australians to provide fast ferries and operate those services in the East Indonesian area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also be participating in the exchange of departmental officers between the Australian department and the Indonesian department. We have set up a transport working group. The contact group's next meeting is on 17 November, I think, in Darwin, just before the Australian Transport Council meeting. Dr Haryanto will be visiting Australia in December, and he will be holding business to business meetings and also meetings with Australian ministers in Canberra. All of this has been done in a spirit of positive cooperation. The result of it will be the creation of jobs both in Australia and in Indonesia&mdash;a most successful outcome, particularly from the transport point of view, as a result of that very good forum held in Indonesia last week.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>As indicated in question time, the terms of this motion have been agreed in discussions between the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). I want to say at the outset that, so far as the government is concerned and I am sure the same applies for the opposition, this motion is not an attempt to pretend some phoney level of bipartisanship; rather, it is an embodiment of certain attitudes and values that both sides of the House in the national parliament have in common.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6156">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It embodies a number of notions which have been enunciated by me repeatedly over a long period of time. It contains commitments to the kind of Australian society that I believe in and have always believed in. It contains a commitment to some common Australian values which are held by Australians, irrespective of whether they were born in this country and irrespective of whether their ancestors came from the British Isles, Europe, the Middle East or Asia. It embodies a number of principles which are a proper underpinning for vigorous and robust debate that ought properly to take place in the Australian community on all issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Whatever the rights and wrongs and the contribution of different people and different attitudes in the Australian community, it comes at a time when it is appropriate and in the national interest to send a clear and unambiguous signal, particularly to the nations of our region but not only to the nations of our region, of the kind of society we are. It is put forward to this parliament by the government and I trust also by the opposition not in any sense of apology, not in any self-conscious sense and not in any self-deprecatory sense, but as a simple, direct and unambiguous statement of certain common values and principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are few nations in the world that can boast such a record of democracy, such a record of fair treatment and such a record of harmonious blending together of people of different racial backgrounds than Australia. Australia remains one of the very few nations of the world that has been continuously democratic for the whole of this century. It pioneered many liberal reforms in many areas. Its record of achievement in integrating into a very harmonious and united nation people from all parts of the world is something of which all of us can be immensely proud and something to which all of us have made a special contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There was a time when this nation was overwhelmingly made up of people, apart from our indigenous people, whose ancestors came from England, Scotland, Ireland or Wales. Successive waves of immigration, particularly after World War II, began to alter <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that pattern; although we continued to have a significant number of immigrants from the British Isles and from Ireland. Subsequently, and certainly in the last 20 years, there has been a significant flow of immigration from the areas of our region, from the Middle East, from South America and also small numbers from the African continent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are certain landmarks along that path of development. The abolition of the White Australia Policy in 1966 under the Liberal prime ministership of Harold Holt represented a very significant cultural and attitudinal change on the part of the Australian people. I accept that it was supported at the time by people across the political spectrum. I also accept that it was not at that time greeted with universal acclaim but I believe it gradually won very strong acceptance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remain very proud of the fact that I was a member of the coalition government led by Malcolm Fraser which, in the late 1970s, chose to admit to this country tens of thousands of people from war&hyphen;torn Indochina; so much so that Australia on a per capita basis took more Indochinese refugees than any nation in the world. It is worth repeating that: Australia took more Indochinese refugees on a per capita basis than any other nation in the world. I repeated that because on occasions I hear voices saying that we have a past which in these areas is totally bigoted and prejudiced. The reality is that, on that occasion, we demonstrated a passion and a willingness to accept and absorb, which was an example to the rest of the world and something of which all Australians should feel particularly proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Inevitably, the character of Australia has changed as a result of this migration. Much of that change has been profoundly beneficial. I think this country owes an enormous debt to people that have chosen this as their home&mdash;people who have come from the four corners of the world. When I returned to the leadership of the Liberal Party on 31 January 1995, one of the things I said was that the policies that we would put together would be guided, in certain respects, by a belief that Australia was composed of people drawn from all parts of the world but united behind a common <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6157"> commitment to the values, beliefs and institutions of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can within our ranks have legitimate debate about the size of our immigration program. There is a different attitude towards immigration now than there was in the 1950s and 1960s. All of us, whatever our political views, should take account of that. You cannot isolate the sense of insecurity and anxiety that people at a time of relatively high unemployment feel from considerations of levels of immigration. There is a legitimate debate to be had as to whether or not we should have more or less immigration. I think that debate should go on in a calm, rational and intelligent fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is natural that people, particularly those who feel themselves at the sharp end of challenge and anxiety in industries that have seen extensive job losses, should feel some sense of anxiety about immigration levels. It is the obligation of all of us to understand that. It is our obligation to point out, where it is appropriate, the error in their understanding of the causation between immigration and job security. But it is also our responsibility to involve them in the debate. It is never appropriate for us, as I think on both sides of the House in the past we have tended to do, to take the attitude towards the Australian community: after all, this is really a little bit too hard for you to understand; leave it to us; we will make the decision on your behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the difficulties and some of the resentments that we have seen in recent times are as a direct result of many Australians feeling that there is in some sense a political elite in this community&mdash;and that political elite has been composed of people from both sides&mdash;that has denied to the people of the Australian community a right to participate. This motion is about saying to the Australian people and to the nations of the region that we are a tolerant society; we are a compassionate society; we are a society that has demonstrated our credentials so far as the absorption of people from all around the world is concerned, in a fashion that entitles us to feel extremely proud about our past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a statement of some fundamental beliefs about the nature of our existence as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> human beings in Australia: the very strong belief that people should always be judged on their individual worth and merit, on their character and behaviour, and on what they do for their fellow man and not on the basis of their ethnic origin, the colour of their skin, their religious beliefs or their lack of religious beliefs, or where they may happen to have been born.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any notion that anybody in this country entertains that it is in the moral, political or economic interests&mdash;and I put them deliberately in that order&mdash;of Australia to return to anything approaching the White Australia policy I think is profoundly wrong. That is a view that my government enunciated when it came to power; it is a view I enunciated when I became the Leader of the Opposition in January last year and I believe that, soberly explained and properly understood and put in the context of some of the things that I have said earlier in this speech, it is something that on reflection the great majority of the Australian people will accept. It is an obligation on all of us to put that view calmly and in an understanding fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion also says something about our attitude towards the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia, the original Australians and first inhabitants of this continent of ours, however one would wish to describe it. There will continue to be debate and there will continue to be sharp differences of opinion between the government and the Australian Labor Party about the appropriate policies to respond to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There will be&mdash;and that is as it should be. But I think we can agree on one or two things. We can agree that as an identifiable group the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are the most profoundly disadvantaged within our midst. That is something I have said not just for the first time and it will not be the last time I say it; it is a view I have expressed before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe, as I know the opposition believes, in a process of reconciliation. We will have our different views as to what reconciliation represents. To me, the most <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6158"> effective way to achieve reconciliation is to address current disadvantage in areas such as health, housing and education. I do not believe, and I have always strongly rejected, notions of intergenerational guilt. I regret as an Australian the appalling way in which members of the indigenous community have been treated in the past and I believe the truth about what occurred in our history should be taught in an unvarnished fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But could I also say that I profoundly reject with the same vigour what others have described, and I have adopted the description, as the black armband view of Australian history. I believe the balance sheet of Australian history is a very generous and benign one. I believe that, like any other nation, we have black marks upon our history but amongst the nations of the world we have a remarkably positive history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a yearning in the Australian community right across the political divide for its leaders to enunciate more pride and sense of achievement in what has gone before us. I think we have been too apologetic about our history in the past. I think we have been far too self&hyphen;conscious about what this country has achieved and I believe it is tremendously important that we understand, particularly as we approach the centenary of the Federation of Australia, that the Australian achievement has been a heroic one, a courageous one and a humanitarian one. Any attempts to denigrate that achievement I believe will derive the justifiable ire and criticism of the Australian community, however people may lie in the political spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some talk in recent weeks about the way in which political debate should be conducted in this country. I have said before, and I am happy to repeat it, that I do believe that in recent times there has been a tendency towards excessive political correctness in political debate in this country. There will be those opposite who will disagree with that. I naturally accept their perfect right to express that disagreement and put their point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the way some people in the Australian community have reacted to the debate of recent weeks, and the way advice has been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> given to me and to others as to the precise way in which I should respond to particular comments, has demonstrated an absolute obsession with the form rather than the substance of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there has been a wholly disproportionate reaction by too many people in too many areas of Australian society to one particular speech. I find it rather interesting that I pick up the newspapers, I watch the television, I listen to the radio and I hear constant talk about the deeply divisive debate on immigration which is going on within the Australian community. Yet I learn on the morning after the Lindsay by&hyphen;election that Australians Against Further Immigration received a little over six per cent of the primary vote in the electorate of Lindsay. If ever AAFI were to have a hope of scoring a high result, it was in the Lindsay by&hyphen;election. Yet the result was that the party polled a derisory share of the popular vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it does say something about the maturity of the Australian people. It demonstrates the ill wisdom of any attempts by any of us to deny the Australian people the courtesy of accepting that they can debate and understand things in a mature and open fashion. Every time we treat them in that patronising fashion, they will demonstrate their great maturity and their great understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two other things that I want to say, I want to say very directly to Australians of Asian descent: so far as the government of this country is concerned, those Australians of Asian descent are as honoured citizens as any other section of the Australian community. People of the Asian communities have contributed very greatly to the enrichment of our life. They have brought their values of the extended family, they have brought their values of hard work, they have brought their values of commitment to small business and entrepreneurial flair and their infectious vigour in so many other areas to our shores, and particularly, but not only, of course, in my own home city of Sydney they have made a very significant mark on the life and the activities of that city.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6159">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They number amongst their ranks like any other section of the Australian community&mdash;people whose views we may or may not share. But it is important that we remember that relations between people have a deeply personal character. Insensitive remarks, hurts, insults and intemperately made generalisations can inflict enormous personal hurt and damage on individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few weeks ago I made a speech to the Queensland division of the Liberal Party, which subsequently attracted some attention. I do not recant, retract or take away one syllable of what I said during that speech. I might be permitted to say something to the House about that speech. I remind the House that, having said that I believed we had entered an era of clear and more open debate in the Australian community, I supported the right of Australians to participate in a vigorous fashion in open political debate. I then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that freedom of speech carries with it a responsibility on all of those who exercise that freedom to do so in a tolerant and moderate fashion and to not convert the new&hyphen;found freedom, if I may put it that way, into a vehicle for using needlessly insensitive and intolerant language.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a caveat and an injunction that I think all members of this House should follow and observe. I hope that this motion attracts the support of everyone in this chamber, because it does reflect, despite our profound political differences, including on some of the issues I have canvassed in my speech, the common assent of the members of the national parliament of Australia to some very important and fundamental human values.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports this motion. It has been negotiated, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicates, between the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) for some time now. It followed the withdrawal of a motion I put down several weeks ago in this chamber dealing with a similar matter. Naturally, as a motion which has been arrived at on the basis of an agreement between the two sides of this House, not all that either side might have liked&mdash;and that applies to us&mdash;is contained within the motion. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Nevertheless, what is there is very good indeed. What is there is an absolutely essential statement by this parliament at this point in our history and at this point in the debate on the matters to which the Prime Minister referred. Therefore, it deserves the optimal possible support from both sides of the House when a vote is ultimately taken on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion is very significant because if it is carried it means the national parliament will insist that an absolutely essential ingredient take its place in the current community discussion about racism and multiculturalism in this society. This ingredient is leadership by us at the national level. Without it, the discussion will go down ugly and destructive paths. Without national leadership, given the discussion on these issues by governments from both sides of the political divide for the last 30 years, we would never have grown into the tolerant, fair, decent and fundamentally democratic society that we are today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We always have been a democratic society. Even at points when we had very different views about immigration to those which we hold now and when a very different standard of treatment was applied to the Aboriginal population than that which is applied now, Australia has had a proud democratic tradition. There is still a version of ballot which is described around the world as the `Australian ballot'. It is the process by which most countries which are democratic undertake their elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of our Federation we were seen as an experimental nation; indeed, we were seen as so experimental that Lenin felt it necessary to devote a pamphlet to attacking the Australian Labor Party, so attractive was its example in international socialist affairs in Europe, and largely coming off the sorts of propositions that were put here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make those points to make this point clear: for well over 100 years, freedom of speech has never been an issue in this country. I do not know what political correctness is supposed to mean. I think it means the prevailing majority of opinion at any time. I suspect that that is what political correctness means, if it means anything at all. I think the problem with juxtaposing two propositions&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6160">freedom of speech versus political correctness&mdash;has had the unfortunate impact on this debate of causing a number of people in our community to take the view that what was always unacceptable under free speech is now acceptable and, therefore, can be expressed. There are a large number of people who have become victims of that in this country as a result of that perception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since World War II, we have received a massive influx of new citizens bringing with them a wide range of cultures. Over this period, we have progressed from what used to be an inward looking society. Each new intake of people brought with it a new culture that enriched and sustained our community. We have now become a society in which all these different cultures are not just accommodated but celebrated. But each time each new wave of migrants came in&mdash;whether they were from southern Europe, eastern Europe, the Middle East and now more recently from Asia&mdash;there has been a requirement on the political leadership in this country to point out the advantage; to mould, insofar as we can, and without arrogance, community opinion that makes it acceptable and ensures that the community sustains its tolerant and decent traditions. There has been that requirement constantly upon us for leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over this same period, our attitudes have changed to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It cannot be said that we have completely in this parliament successfully discharged the responsibility given to the government by the 1967 referendum. But much has been achieved to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people their honoured place in the development of Australia as a decent nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is 30 years since the coalition parties and we ourselves, then in opposition, wiped our platforms clean of the phrase `White Australia'. It is more than 20 years now since the concept of White Australia was finally abolished in any implication from official government policy. It is 20 years since the Fraser government enacted the Northern Territory land rights legislation, based on propositions originally moved in the time when Gough Whitlam was in government. I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> might say that it is now something like 45 years since my father moved land rights onto the Labor Party platform. It is more than 20 years since the Whitlam government embraced the concept of a multicultural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these periods of time we have, I do believe, much to be very proud of. But it has to be said that these are new initiatives and new things because treatment and attitudes were different before then. In the discussion of our history these must be completely understood by all people in our society. If every person in this society is going to be entitled to their culture, they are also going to be entitled to their history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we need to comprehend in the fullness the nature of that history and what its true character is. Some of that will require us in this generation to pass judgment, whether we like it or not, on what was and was not acceptable about policy in the past. Probably in no area is that more necessary than in relations with the Aboriginal community&mdash;and this is a central part of the reconciliation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have my own disagreements with some of the current teaching in relation to past racial relations and Aboriginal questions that now form part of the school curriculum, and I do not intend to bore the parliament with those at this time. But I do think that if you look realistically at Aboriginal people you have to qualify the notion of settlement, you have to include the question of invasion, and they are entitled to the dignity of resistance. I am delighted to see that in the recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford Companion to Australian Military History </EMPHASIS>there is now an excellent section dealing with Aboriginal resistance. I hope that those issues come into the curriculums and are thoroughly understood. It is an interesting part of our history and it is a part of our history that we do need to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made some very substantial changes. I mention those changes with pride as an Australian. They have been critical to our developing a decent society and they are critical for our future. They are also critical for our relationship with the region around us.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6161">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has happened really just in time. We were really shut out of our traditional markets in the 1960s, or our entry to them was made very difficult indeed. Successive governments have struck out of the embrace of those traditional markets and the lock&hyphen;step relationship that we had with them to build a very substantial trading posture for this nation. But it is being built in the region around us. Over the last 13 years we have had a much more significant proportion of our GDP in exports. In gaining that situation, virtually all of that increase has been a product of our successful penetration of markets in the region around us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along the way we have been able to present to those societies the notion that we are a decent, hospitable society with an honoured place in the global community. Through such policies that we have been talking about here today and others, which include support for the elimination of apartheid in South Africa, we on this side of the House were quick to recognise the role played in this by former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. That position was confirmed and continued by the Hawke and Keating governments and produced that moving and magnificent visit by Nelson Mandela here in his new position in a changed South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes have been critical to the solidity and strength of our relationship with the rest of the region. We have grown into the sort of society which our neighbours are proud to be associated with and with which they are happy to trade. Of course, we have to be realistic. One of the reasons we are a decent society is that we are a pluralistic society, and not everybody agrees with the path that we have taken. But when those views are as false and destructive as some of those which have been put about lately they have to be answered and dealt with in detail. However great the disagreement, we have to preserve our climate of tolerance. When people are abused in public places, it is time for government, for people in authority, to step in and beat the bounds. That is what we need now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a disgrace that, because of the way in which the issues of race and multiculturalism <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been argued lately, Australian citizens would be physically abused in the streets because of their perceived origins. I am especially saddened when I see reports of the headlines about all this in newspapers in countries all around us, especially when newspapers reflect&mdash;or are supposed to reflect&mdash;official or at least authoritative opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has never been portrayed in this way&mdash;never. In the days when we did pursue discriminatory policies, the ambience of international relations was very different, as were our trading patterns&mdash;and that despite some changes. Indeed, the changes to immigration policy also came at a time when our trading relations with the South&hyphen;East Asian region changed quite considerably simultaneously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reports have to be mentioned and have to be dealt with. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bangkok Post</EMPHASIS>, for example, talked of Australia's `new&hyphen;found freedom of speech and bigotry'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South China Morning Post </EMPHASIS>talked of our response as `a stamp of approval for those individuals who hold extremist views to take the stage in Australia'. An official of the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce thought that `The debate would make many local people think twice about travelling to Australia'. `It would not take much in Hong Kong', he said, `to revive memories of the dark days of the White Australia Policy'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A prominent scholar in the School of Commerce at Keio University in Japan also thought that the debate that was developing evoked memories of White Australia. As we have seen this week, this view continues among commentators in our region. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bangkok Post</EMPHASIS>, for example, has commentated on the prolonged silence on the issues being debated. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nation</EMPHASIS> newspaper of Thailand has warned of potential economic retaliation against Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder, therefore, that the former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser has had to point out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The discussion has now got to the point where it is extraordinarily dangerous for the future of Aust&hyphen; ralia.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6162"> </PARA>
<PARA>These changes that we have seen over the last 20 or 30 years have made Australia a good and decent place to live. They were successful because they have received consistent bipartisan support. They have been sustained because they were supported by the national leadership of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is always appropriate to debate matters around these issues. Obviously, from time to time we are going to have disagreements about what exactly the content of some particular policy should be in Aboriginal affairs or immigration. But our messages must always be clear&hyphen;cut, and not subliminal. Our messages to the people of this nation must always contain what we actually believe. There must never be any suspicion in the public mind that when we say one thing we mean another and that we hope to gain from encouraging the other to be expressed more fully. We must never do that in the opinions that we express because that debate gets out of control very quickly. It has consequences that we do not intend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a nation which has become a clever nation, an effective nation. I am proud to boast when I go overseas, for example, that there are more Japanese speakers per capita in Australia than in any other country outside Japan. We go through a whole series of Asian languages which we teach in our schools. We go through a whole re-orientation of Australian business to present itself effectively in the region around us. We have presented as a nation with a great brand name, not simply as a nation of primary products but as a nation of sophisticated value added product as well, important though both of those are. We have been substantially changing ourselves in the way in which we have presented ourselves in the region as a modern sophisticated society&mdash;and therein lies our economic survival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are issues of economics and they are also issues of morals and politics. These points need to be conveyed. There are no prospects of a decent employment future without an effective posture in the region around us&mdash;none. There is no prospect of an opportunity for young people in this country without that relationship with the region around us&mdash;none. We cannot survive as a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nation with a market based on a population of 18 million people. It is not possible. Therefore, the policies that we pursue are not just about the nature and character of our society, vital though those are; they are also utterly critical about the nature of the future survival of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got these policies right by and large over the last 30 years. It is absolutely critical that they stay right. It is very important that this motion, when it is passed, goes out as a signal to the region around us that Australia is still in business as a decent society, as a society that is interested in doing the right thing in the way we relate to the region around us and a society that does not talk up its sleeve about the nature of the racial, cultural or whatever background of the people with whom we do business or about any of our citizens.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are critical times when it is necessary for the Parliament of Australia to address motions of this kind. I am privileged to support this joint motion put to the House by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). I am delighted to see in the gallery the presence of Senator Bill O'Chee, and I note the certain absence of others. Senator Bill O'Chee is of Chinese- Irish descent. I commend to members of the House the words he uttered to the Senate this day when he represented to the Senate in clear&hyphen;cut terms what it has meant to be an Australian, what it means to be an Australian and the difficulties he endured in growing up in Australia. He is a proud Australian. I know that he would want me to indicate his support for this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no room in this parliament for racism. There is no room in this parliament, in the government or in the opposition for racism. The National Party abhors racism and its ugly effects. It was Jack McEwen, I remind the House, who in 1957, against considerable opposition, some of it racially motivated, drove through and gave leadership to the negotiation of the then Australia-Japan Trade Treaty signed off by the coalition government at the time. He faced resolutions <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6163"> of no confidence from the RSL of the day and from other elements of the society of the day. But it was clear&hyphen;cut leadership at the time. It was correct leadership at the time. It is, in a sense, leadership replicated in the motion before the House today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For too long in this country the ignorant and the marginalised have been looking for scapegoats. Sadly, immigrants and Australians of Aboriginal heritage are the easiest scapegoats, for various reasons. These attitudes are unacceptable. These agendas are destructive. They are destructive of job creation and job sustainability, quite apart from the moral dimensions, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out. I make it very clear that we are absolutely opposed to the attitudes and agendas being pushed by certain elements at this time and previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Australians must enjoy equal rights, as stated by the motion. This country must have and does have a wholly non-discriminatory immigration policy. This country must deal with the profound social issues facing Australians of Aboriginal heritage, but do it sensibly. These issues come about as a result of both economic circumstances and geographic isolation. They are issues that can only be dealt with through a process of reconciliation rather than the profound dishonesty which comes from bigotry, discrimination and scapegoating. But the programs associated with providing the solutions must be practical, must be sensible and must help add to the cohesion of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society. I find that that makes for a more exciting and invigorating Australia than might otherwise be the case. Does anyone seriously assert that Australia is not a better place for the input of various people from various parts of the world, be it from the Mediterranean, be it from the Middle East, be it from Asia, be it from Latin America or be it from elsewhere? There is hardly a town in Australia nowadays which does not have an Italian or a Chinese restaurant&mdash;in many cases for many decades&mdash;or a Lebanese or a Thai restaurant. There is hardly a town in Australia without a substantial proportion of residents from overseas. This is positive.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians, by and large, welcome the diversity. Australians are not ugly, as is so often depicted, but rather an extraordinarily tolerant, easygoing people who have welcomed the diversity and challenges that come from a non&hyphen;discriminatory immigration policy. In judging Australia on these matters, I would submit that our benchmarks with regard to our non&hyphen;discriminatory immigration policy, our benchmarks with regard to the general modus operandi of what it means to be Australian and go about our lives here in Australia, can be judged well and we can walk tall and proudly when compared to many other countries in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the motion that has been formulated by the Leader of the House and Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). It is a motion which I will put forward on a forthcoming brief visit through Thailand to India for the launch of the government's New Horizons program&mdash;not with any sense of feeling defensive about the matter, but as a proud Australian, determined to promote a proud Australia, a capable Australia, a cohesive Australia that will build, through mutual respect, the sort of expanded links of the trade, investment, tourism and cultural kind that we would want with our part of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have done that for many, many years before it became fashionable to do so. During the many years I spent in opposition, I sent frequent cables and requests for help through DFAT, at the time when my colleague opposite, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, was Minister for Foreign Affairs, because I made working visits to 19 different Asian countries before March this year, when I had the privilege to become Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say in conclusion: firstly, governments set trade and foreign affairs policy priorities. The Australian coalition government has decided that Asia is our top trade and foreign affairs policy priority. No individuals will be allowed to derail that. Secondly, on the export front, which was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, our exports to that region of the world totalled $46 billion last year and our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6164"> imports from that region totalled $28 billion, a net surplus of $18 billion. We choose our non&hyphen;discriminatory immigration policies and our approach embodied in this motion for moral reasons. But it is instructive to think also of the practical circumstances.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, let me say one other thing: Australians have the right to decide who comes to live in Australia. We should exercise that right. We should make no apology for doing so. After all, every other country seeks to do just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will continue to build our relations with the region based on mutual respect. I commend this motion to the House and to the nation, to all Australians, as being a fairly constructed and carefully worded motion which is correct at this time, as it would be correct at other times, in one sense in the relatively short history of Australia by some European standards, but in a proud history of Australia and the achievements that Australia has brought about in this part of the world. We can walk tall in relation to it. I support the motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me begin by putting this in rather personal terms. I do not think there is any resolution with which I have been associated in my 18 years in the parliament which I have regarded as more important than this one. That is essentially because there is no issue about which I have cared more deeply throughout my adult life than the issue of racial tolerance&mdash;as a student campaigning against the white Australia policy and for Aboriginal rights in the 1960s, as a lawyer working in the 1970s on drafting racial discrimination legislation and helping to found Aboriginal legal services around the country, and then as a parliamentarian and as a minister, in the 1980s and 1990s, very passionately committed to the evolution of Australia as a genuinely multicultural society with a wholly new kind of relationship with our regional neighbourhood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing hitherto in parliament, I think, has made me prouder than the role I helped to play in piloting the Mabo legislation through our parliament. Nothing made me prouder as Australia's Foreign Minister over eight or so <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years than my sense that over the last decade Australia really had come of age. It had come of age as a tolerant, outwardly looking, genuinely multicultural society, revelling in the fact of our diversity, with people among us born in over 140 different countries&mdash;in the case of my own electorate, about 120 different countries; as a country genuinely committed for the first time to reconciliation with our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; and as a country which was genuinely embarking on redressing a great historical injustice by recognising, for the first time, land rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very proud, as Foreign Minister, as a member of the previous government and this parliament, of the way in which Australia was rapidly becoming fully integrated into our own Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, and especially East Asian region; not any longer as a kind of nervous outsider, the Anglo&hyphen;Saxon outpost, feeling alone and threatened in an alien sea; not as the urchin outside the tart shop wanting to get in and be part of the glittering economic action but being excluded essentially from it, not least because of a sense of distance and alienation from what was going on; rather, as a player, as a participant, as a partner in that region, respected and appreciated for our commitment and our contribution to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was proud, too, of the way in which this country was becoming so evidently to have, as part of our community, a growing number of Australians of Asian origin and a huge presence here of students, tourists and business visitors from throughout the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against that background, nothing has made me more troubled in recent weeks than the sense that all of this was slipping away, in the new and very ugly atmosphere generated, let us state it frankly, by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), by her immediate supporters, by those who have given encouragement, active or tacit, to her, and by those&mdash;let us face it again&mdash;failing to exercise leadership in speaking out against her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of that support and because of that failure of leadership, a great deal of damage has already been done. Many individuals have been hurt, many have been humiliated, many have been distressed and, in some cases, some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6165"> have even been assaulted as a result of the atmosphere that has been generated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's hard won reputation in the region has been put at dramatic risk, and the editorials and the articles that have proliferated around the region in recent days are abundant proof of that. There is a fear abroad, if you want to look at it economically, in the business community about the future of tourism, about discretionary tenders, about discretionary investment and about the future of education exports if this spirit and atmosphere continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, worst of all in many ways, there has been a resurgence&mdash;in the name of `free speech', in the name of `the end of political correctness'&mdash;of what can only be described as indecency and incivility in public discourse in this country. We have old stereotypes, old idiocies, old insults abounding&mdash;about the place `being swamped by Asians'; about the country being `mongrelised'&mdash;I never thought I would hear again in public discourse that word that we heard the other day from the Mayor of Port Lincoln; about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people not being disadvantaged so much as being especially `privileged' members of our community, for god's sake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Malcolm Fraser, whom I have always much admired for his position on these issues, said recently of the member for Oxley quite specifically, in words which should have been heard long before today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She is just plain wrong, and wrong in ways that can lead to great evil.</PARA>
<PARA>Because of all this, there has been a desperate need for a circuit&hyphen;breaker. A desperate need in this country for political leadership to reassert itself, for markers to be laid down, for guidance to be given by this parliament about what is decent and civil, not indecent and uncivil in the public discourse of this country, and the basic principles that must be observed if we are to avoid hurt, distress and humiliation to individuals in our midst, if we are to preserve the social fabric and harmony of our community and if we are to avoid harm to Australia's international interests and standing. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a matter of prohibiting the expression of any views on any of these issues. But it is certainly not a matter of encouraging and giving comfort to those views and expressions that are wrong in fact, deeply hurtful to individuals, deeply harmful to the community's harmony as a whole and deeply hurtful to our international reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion provides that circuit&hyphen;breaker and it is not before time. It covers all the key issues that need to be addressed, the principles that need to be laid down. It does so in a way that is concise but, I hope, is unmistakably clear. It should be said that the language is not necessarily that which we ideally would have preferred. Drafting involves a process of give and take and I acknowledge the very constructive spirit in which the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) played the role of embarking on this exercise with me in recent days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some concepts as a result of that process that are less clearly developed than I would have liked&mdash;the concept of `reconciliation', which has many more dimensions to it than that which are implied perhaps by the terms of this motion; the language of `economic and social disadvantage' of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; and I would have liked to have seen specific reference to the `spiritual and cultural needs', in the context particularly of land rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would certainly have liked&mdash;as would I think all of us on this side of the chamber and perhaps many on your side as well&mdash;to have seen a specific reference to a `multicultural' Australia&mdash;with the coalition not being afraid and shirking specific reference to the `M' word, a word after all which appears in all the policy documents of the coalition before the last election and in the title of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) sitting here in this chamber. But, that said, the points are made. The language is there of commitment to cultural diversity and the message is unmistakably clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6166"> The motion also avoids saying some things that perhaps should have been said, in particular about Australian history. About our 200 year history of sad mistreatment and neglect, and often worse than that, of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. And our shame ful 70&hyphen;year history, this century since we federated, of the White Australia policy&mdash;a history for which my party bears much of the responsibility, we being racists long before we were socialists, as I have had occasion to say at party forums from time to time&mdash;to the great disgust of many of my colleagues, but it is true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister said we should reject the `black armband' theory of Australian history. I put it this way: it is not a matter of demanding that people accept guilt now for what happened in all those years gone by. Guilt perhaps is an inappropriate thing to demand of people who were not personally responsible. But it is a matter, and we can distinguish it, of acknowledging the shame of what went so badly wrong for so long. It is a matter of shame and we should acknowledge that, learn from it and construct appropriate and new policy responses accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has been on record&mdash;he did not say it today, but he has said it often enough before&mdash;that `Australia should not have to choose between its history and its geography'. The point is however, I have to say, that in our national interest, especially our relationships with our own region, we do have to choose, because our history for the first seven decades of this century&mdash;the white Australia policy history&mdash;is an appalling liability. It would be a real sign of coming of age, of maturity, to recognise that liability. Not, as I say, as a matter of guilt for individuals not directly responsible but certainly as a matter of shame for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all those reservations, this is a motion which says a great deal about the kind of society we have become and should aspire to continue to be&mdash;diverse, tolerant, open and inclusive. I for one have not been very proud to be an Australian these last few weeks. But I am proud today to be part of a parliament which is prepared to commit itself to the values and principles set out in this motion. And if this motion has the impact which we all&mdash;or the overwhelming majority at least of us in this parliament&mdash;hope that it will, I will be, like most others in this chamber, a very proud Australian once again.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion that has been moved by the Prime Minister encompasses very much what are becoming the traditional values of Australia. As a foreign minister, like my predecessor I do a great deal of travelling and meet people of all cultures and just about all countries. When you come back to Australia, one of the things that never ceases to surprise you is the relaxed, polite and decent way in which people in Australia treat each other. It is that deep&hyphen;rooted sense of decency in Australia that the rest of the world needs to understand, and I think increasingly does understand. Australians are not threatening people. Australians are not impolite, unduly aggressive people. They are not at heart, as the Prime Minister of Malaysia pointed out the other day, a racist people. This motion that has been moved in the House today very much encompasses those sentiments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally welcome, and I know the government welcomes, the commitment to equality and diversity free from racial intolerance. I welcome the government's support for a non&hyphen;discriminatory immigration policy and I welcome the support for the reconciliation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion, in a practical sense, is very important for two reasons: first&mdash;it is not a term that members of parliament often use or are advised often to use&mdash;this motion does have a real moral force. I was making a speech to the Foreign Affairs trainees over at the new Casey building a couple of weeks ago. There were trainees from Australia and quite a number of countries around the world. I was telling them of my experience when I first joined the foreign service back in 1976 and did a training course with people from 10 or 15 different countries&mdash;probably more like 15 than 10. They were countries with quite different cultures and creeds and colours.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6167">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you spend time with people from different cultures and creeds and of different colours, you realise how irrelevant those things are. You realise how fundamentally cruel and unfair it is&mdash;and, as I put it, how fundamentally immoral it is&mdash;to discriminate against people on the basis of colour. It is a completely irrational thing to do, but it is certainly something that has a deep moral dimension. I think it is appropriate that, on this rare occasion, this parliament recognises the moral dimension of racial issues. Like other members of the parliament on both sides, I have always abhorred racism. We want the world to know that, as a country, we overwhelmingly, if not unanimously, utterly abhor racism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing I would say about the motion is that it is a matter of real and obvious self&hyphen;interest that we should promote these sorts of values. First of all, in a country made up of people from around 130 different countries, if we are to achieve internal harmony we have to have as one of our core community values the value of tolerance. People really have to understand that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great tragedies of so many multicultural communities around the world is that they are so intolerant, that different cultures are so intolerant of each other. Unless you preach the value of tolerance, unless you entrench the value of tolerance as a core value in your society, you simply will not succeed in holding that society together. People in the Australian community who do not appreciate that need to learn it and understand it. This is a blessed country in that it lives in such peace and such harmony. But it is not something we in Australia should just take for granted. It is something achieved because we have an underlying fundamental value of tolerance and it needs to be utterly entrenched in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason why it is in our self&hyphen;interest to promote the values of this motion is that Australia is living&mdash;and is recognising that it is living, in the main&mdash;in an increasingly internationalised world: the global village, as many like to say. There is no point in trying to pretend you can get away from it. Love it or loathe it&mdash;and I personally am on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the side of loving it&mdash;you cannot avoid it. It is there. Telecommunications, physical communications&mdash;transport, for example&mdash;the global trend towards market liberalisation, towards reducing trade and tariff and non&hyphen;tariff barriers, are all entrenched. That is the way the world is going. It has not got nearly as far as it is going to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Bogor declaration becomes a reality&mdash;and I believe it will&mdash;by 2020 there will be no protection left of any kind in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. What an excellent thing that will be. That will contribute to the living standards of the people of this country as well those of the other 17 members of APEC&mdash;and there will probably be quite a few more members of APEC by 2020.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also true that the general trend in the World Trade Organisation is towards internationalisation and a reduction in tariff protection. It is just commonsense economics. Of course, you will always find a few people left in the world who want to try to resist this trend. They will gradually be washed out with the tide because their ideas simply do not stand up to scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, if Australia wants to participate in the international community&mdash;in other words, if members of this House want Australians to be able to get jobs and want to see their living standards rise&mdash;we have to demonstrate to the world that we are an open and tolerant society. If we decided not only to pull up the tariff drawbridge but to pull up some sort of racial drawbridge as well, then Australia would become completely isolated from the rest of the world. It would be a grossly irresponsible thing for this parliament even to contemplate. It would crush living standards in this country. It would destroy tens of thousands of jobs. It would also be a quite immoral and foolish thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a practical interest in promoting the values that underline this motion. Look at Australia. It is a country surrounded by nations of quite varied cultures and with people of all sorts of creeds. If we are to be successful in engaging with our own region&mdash;and we have to be&mdash;there is no point in adopting old&hyphen;fashioned, racist, elitist attitudes. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6168"> It would simply and utterly destroy this country if we adopted those sorts of values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely we have a self&hyphen;interest in cultural diversity, not the ennui of a mono&hyphen;culture. At 45 years of age, even I have seen the evolution of cultural diversity in Australia. I am glad to say that my father, as the minister for immigration for six years in this country, made a good contribution to developing this country's cultural diversity, but since his time it has become much more culturally diverse. And how we rejoice in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People talk about restaurants and cuisine&mdash;that is one thing&mdash;but there is much more to cultural diversity than that. It makes Australia such a colourful, fascinating and unique society.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) would know, it is an enormous honour to be the foreign minister and to attend international conferences, meet with international organisations and go to other countries as the representative of a country like Australia. Okay, like any country, it has a few bigots running around saying vile things, but it is a country peopled overwhelmingly by really decent people, caring people, moral people, a country with great cultural diversity, and a country with a great underlying tradition and sense of tolerance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can feel really proud walking into the United Nations&mdash;dare I mention it&mdash;as the Australian foreign minister because you know you come from a country which is a pretty good place and which is pretty well trouble free because there is an overwhelming acknowledgment of the commonsense of tolerance and of the morality of decency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The passage of this resolution will be an emphatic <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> statement to the people of Australia, and to those interested in this debate from outside our borders, that this parliament will not allow the subject of race to be used for short&hyphen;term political gain. It will not be toyed with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two great political movements that this country has generated&mdash;the Labor Party and the coalition parties&mdash;have joined together on unambiguous common ground to reject racism. Let those who take offence at that fact take their arguments where they may. They have a right of free speech. Let them make their case as they will. But we too have responsibilities and the right to speak. We should speak with a common voice and we should say, as we do say in this motion, that there is no place for a second preference strategy on racism in the Australian political system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not underestimate the degree of difficulty in dealing with some of the problems that have emerged recently. There have been instances where school kids of Asian background and Arab background have been bashed. There have been instances where visiting troops from countries with whom we have friendly relations have been assaulted. There have been instances were Jewish broadcasters have had their houses daubed. This is a serious issue. This is an issue which should have been nipped in the bud but which has been allowed to bloom. We need to put an end to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion will not discharge our responsibilities fully because our responsibilities are ongoing. Our responsibilities do not end with our speaking in this House, joining together, Labor and coalition, to state a common position in relation to these matters. Our responsibility&mdash;each and every one of us&mdash;is to continued leadership in the Australian community on these issues of fundamental importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has said, that we are only 20 years from the time when the Labor Party expunged the White Australia policy from its policy documents. It was only in 1967 that Aboriginal Australians were recognised within the census and given the right to vote. So there are layers of tradition and history in our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6169"> country based upon a set of beliefs that are still held by some within our community, notwithstanding the quite proper bipartisan stand on this issue over the last 25 years. We need to build on that bipartisanship and never allow ourselves to be tainted by the thought that there could be political advantage in exploiting those who do not share those views which are so fundamental to our national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are a new nation. One of the great differences between us and some other countries is that we do not have a history of prolonged conflict between different peoples within our borders. Only 200 years ago, white settlement brought with it people from different religious backgrounds, some coming as convicts to this country. It brought the Irish and the English&mdash;people who had longstanding and religion&hyphen;based enmities between them and which are still manifesting themselves in sectarian ways in their home countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Successive generations and waves of people who have come to this country have come from places where there are long-built structures which have led one person to stand against another on the basis of racial, cultural, social or religious divide. That has not been our history. We must insist that it never become our history. We have the chance to build a new nation built on diversity and tolerance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever else we might say, now that there has been 25 years of a non&hyphen;discriminatory policy within this country, the option of going back is no longer there. There are something of the order of 3&half; million people who have made Australia their home and who have come from non&hyphen;Anglo&hyphen;Saxon backgrounds. They come from different cultures and are of different races. They have come to this country to make it their home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some environments you might say that that is a difficult thing. If I were to settle in Japan or Germany, I might find it hard, even though I might live there, to think of myself as German or Japanese. That is because there is such a long cultural history. In Australia, we are making our nation together. We make our nation out of diversity. Our nation is made out of tolerance. It is made out of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> respect for others. The one thing we demand of new people who come to this country is that they share this tolerance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have they lived up to that? I would say remarkably so. Wherever there have been ethnic conflicts around the globe, have they been transmitted into conflicts in our society? Remarkably rarely. Have we been able to maintain a civil society based on respect for democratic and fundamental values? I believe the answer to that is yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can we allow that to be undone? I believe we must not. Yet the responsibility will always be on each and every one of us as leaders not to allow it. It is possible. I sometimes think that we are too complacent. We think that advancement in human evolution is a necessary thing, but it is not. We have instances of places that have superficially civilised and democratic structures having fallen apart when voices of intolerance have gained a foothold. We have seen those things happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are lessons for us to learn. We have nothing to learn by looking to the old countries of Europe or, indeed, the countries of Asia in what they can teach us, other than the example of how to build a society built around respect for each other as we make this new country our home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This does not mean that there will be no disagreements. A phoney kind of argument has been put on a number of occasions that because Labor and the coalition agree on these fundamental issues of value we are in some sense seeking to repress free speech or not allow the Australian community to be heard. Far from it. What we are doing is that which leaders in a democratic society ought to do, and that is articulate the principles and visions that we believe will make Australia a secure place for all of us in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will still remain areas of significant and quite substantial debate. This House will debate legislation proposed by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) which was tabled last week. The parties will disagree on some aspects of that legislation. In the Senate, the Labor Party has moved to disallow a number of regulations the minister has proposed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6170">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That debate ought to be conducted with respect and restraint. Each and every one of us in this parliament ought to have seen what has occurred in the last few weeks and realise our particular responsibilities in this area. There are substantial disagreements. They go to values and issues relating to policy, but they also relate to second order issues. They must not go to the fundamental issue of our integrity as a society or the right to respect every other person's entitlements as a citizen, once they have come here to make this country their home, to feel safe here and to know that their government respects those rights and will speak straightforwardly on every occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also an obligation to make sure that we do, because of our agreement about these fundamentals, go out into the community and articulate those things. One point that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) raised which is true is that there was a certain degree of complacency that, because there was agreement between the two major parties, the case did not have to be articulated perhaps as vigorously as it might. So some myths grew&mdash;the myth, for example, that Australia was being swamped by Asians. The fact is, as the minister has said, that about four per cent of Australians currently living in Australia come from Asian backgrounds.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Born in Asia. I think, subject to confirmation, that figure is less than the proportion of Asians who lived in Australia at the time of Federation. I also understand that the projected figures, anticipating a migration program of the same order as the minister is currently administering, will see the proportion of Asians who would come under a non-discriminatory policy&mdash;assuming that they come at the rate of recent times&mdash;reaching about seven per cent of the Australian community. It is not appropriate to regard that as being swamped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other myth is that Australia has run and is running a high immigration policy. The truth is that the last five years has seen immigration in this country halved over the postwar norms. The current government is running an immigration program based on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> average of the last five years. The argument that there is a high immigration intake at the moment simply is not true. The high immigration period of Australia's postwar history has ended. This is an issue which requires leadership on both sides and requires continuing attention. The passage of this motion in this parliament will be of great healing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not pleased to participate in this debate today. It is the second occasion on which I have been involved in a motion to affirm our non-discriminatory approach to the selection of migrants in Australia, to denounce racial intolerance and to affirm that we wish to treat all Australians, all visitors, temporary residents and others who happen to be legally in Australia with equal rights and respect regardless of their race, creed or country of origin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I dare say it is not the first occasion that we have seen motions dealing with the circumstances of our indigenous people. It is the first occasion&mdash;and I am pleased that the terms are there&mdash;in which there is a reaffirmation of our culturally diverse, tolerant and open society united by an overriding commitment to our nation, its democratic institutions and values. I will come back to that as I make my comments today, because I think it is important to understand that the people who have come here to settle have the same regard for our constitution, the rule of law, parliamentary democracy, freedom of speech and English as the national language&mdash;all the substantial democratic institutions and values which have made this country one of the great democratic nations of this world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to understand why it is necessary that we  take this approach. The scale of immigration to Australia over the last 40 years has been very significant. It accounts for about half of our population growth. A remarkably high proportion of Australians are overseas born. Something like 20 per cent of people who were born in another country constitute Australia today. More than half of those people come from non-English speaking countries&mdash;from Europe, the Middle East, Asia and South America. Combined with their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6171"> Australian born children, they constitute something like 40 per cent of our population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a strong pattern of intermarriage between Australians of different backgrounds, and today less than half the population is seen to be of Anglo&hyphen;Celtic origin. So less than half the population today are descended from those early British and Irish settlers. Over 60 per cent of Australians have at least two different ethnic origins and 20 per cent have four or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to recognise that we have great diversity in our language skills. Something of the order of two million Australians, or 14 per cent of Australians over the age of five, speak a language other than English at home. This is part of Australia today. There was a reference to building a new nation. We have in fact built a new nation, and it is a culturally diverse nation. It is one to which we all ought to be very proud to belong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can be a culturally diverse nation only if we treat each other with respect, if we accept that there are mutual obligations upon each of us to tolerantly accept others. We have to accept that they will have different views at times and different cultural values, but within the context of those overarching values that I mentioned before one should not be troubled about that. One should not be troubled that they look at all different or speak a little differently. How else would we expect people who have come to Australia from another land to be in their first years of settlement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) reaffirmed today, and I want to reaffirm, that free speech is an important value in this country but it cannot be used as a vehicle for needlessly insensitive and intolerant language and overt discrimination against other Australians. This is part and parcel of the nation that is Australia today. The approach that we are taking on these matters, which I think was set out so admirably in the national agenda for a multicultural Australia, reaffirms the right of all Australians to share and express their individual and cultural heritages, the right of all Australians to equality of treatment and opportunity, the removal of barriers of race, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ethnicity, culture, religion, language, gender, place of birth, and the need to maintain, develop and utilise the skills and talents of all Australians regardless of their background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Together with those stated limits that they are based upon the premise that all Australians have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia, those basic values that I have mentioned as well as the reciprocal obligations constituted a good expression of what it means to be a multicultural nation and one that is able to work and function very effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I want to speak about how effectively it has worked&mdash;and it has. When you think of the troubles and turmoils in other parts of the world, we have not experienced those difficulties here in Australia. We think of the tragedies that so many others have endured, and we think of the pressure that we have put some of our community under at different points in time and how they respond to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pressure that so many people are under in our Australian society today is of concern to me, but think of the time when we were involved in a war with many of the countries of the Middle East and the people who settled in this country from the Middle East were part of our society, functioning in our society, and were essentially good Australians during that very difficult period. If you think of the people that have come here from that tragic area of the Balkans, where families have seen their loved ones killed very tragically by those of a different religion, different racial group, we have here in Australia those same people able to live side by side. They do not always do it easily, but they do it. That is something that we have been able to achieve very significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major factors in our winning of the Olympic Games for the year 2000 was the extent to which we were able to build on those linkages that so many parts of the Australian community had with so many other parts of the world to demonstrate our success as a multicultural nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I have written recently about some of the myths&mdash;I am pleased the shadow minister for immigration referred to them&mdash;that are occasionally perpetuated about the nature of our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6172"> immigration program. The shadow minister dealt with the issue of the extent to which we have an Asian cohort. One ought not to be, in any way, threatened by the numbers of people of Asian backgrounds who are here in Australia. One ought to be proud that we are able to have them amongst us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today one of my colleagues gave me a report from a Brisbane newspaper outlining the success of a Taiwanese family who, having come to Australia as business migrants, invested something of the order of $30 million in Australia and have created jobs for some 250 Australians and, obviously, have supported their families. We ought to be proud that we have people like this come here and settle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to acknowledge that if we have tourism, if we have temporary residence, there are at times more people from Asia who are in Australia for other circumstances who are not permanent residents in Australia. This may give the impression in parts of Australia often frequented by tourists that we have more migrants than the statistics state is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to deal with the myths about unemployment, to deal with the myths about disease and to understand, for instance, that overseas born people in Australia have a lower hospital utilisation rate than Australian born residents. It is important to understand that migrants are, in the main, law&hyphen;abiding and contribute to our Australian society. It is important to understand that migrants do come here and settle over time successfully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is often reference to ghettos. I know that the places referred to as ghettos 20 or 30 years ago are now seen as part of the vibrant, cosmopolitan city that I belong to today. A place like Norton Street, Leichhardt was called a ghetto 20 years ago, but nobody regards it as a ghetto today. I have to say that, when I go to places like Springvale and Cabramatta, I find them very pleasant places in which to be with fellow Australians. I find that those who refer to them as ghettos fail to understand that, in municipalities like Fairfield, there is only 15 per cent of the population that might be born in one other country. They certainly do not constitute ghettos in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any respect whatsoever. I am very proud to stand up and support this motion today, and I hope it will be carried unanimously.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am also pleased to be able to speak in support of this motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). This reaffirmation by both sides of the mainstream of Australian politics, this great reaffirmation of a true bipartisan commitment to the vital principles contained in the motion, is a matter of enormous importance to the parliament this day and, indeed, to the future of our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I think it is a matter of regret that we have to have the debate at all. I do not believe it would have been necessary if there had been at the outset a united and absolute rejection of the views expressed by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in this parliament some seven weeks ago. It would not have been essential for the parliament to take this action today but for a profound lack of leadership on this issue&mdash;an issue that goes to the very heart of our nation's character and, indeed, to our nation's future in the world as a country with a tolerant, open, democratic and multicultural society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some seven weeks ago it was my singular misfortune, as duty shadow minister, to be present in the House when the member for Oxley raised these matters. I do not intend today to dwell on that speech or on the similar views that the member has expressed subsequently; suffice it to say that I consider it to be one of the saddest contributions to parliamentary debate that I have heard in the course of my political career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that speech the member for Oxley denounced assistance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as something which encouraged separatism and racial division. She called for a radical review of our immigration policy and for the abolition of multiculturalism. She declared that Australia was in danger of being swamped by Asians. Speaking in Melbourne on 10 October she called for an explicitly discriminatory immigration policy, saying that the number of migrants from Asian regions was simply too <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6173"> high and must be corrected. Indeed, she has warned that Australia is headed for civil war if these purported remedies are not adopted. For good measure, in what must be considered a sad exercise in low&hyphen;grade popularism, the honourable member has called for the abolition of ATSIC, for the cessation of Australia's foreign aid programs and for the termination of our cooperation with the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The member for Oxley says that she is not a racist; that is her claim. I have no hesitation, nor should anyone else, in identifying these themes and these views as being racist in character. If a person holds racist views, I, unlike the Prime Minister, find no difficulty in reaching the obvious conclusion. To me, the views expressed by the member are absolutely objectionable and deserve the total condemnation of all in the mainstream of Australian politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the seven weeks since the first speech of the member for Oxley, we have seen an anti-Asian and anti-aboriginal debate run away like a bushfire through our community. No responsible member of this parliament can deny that. We have all seen and heard the evidence. The member for Oxley sparked a fire which has burned brightly in our media, where she has enjoyed a very real spotlight. It has flared on talkback radio where her statements have provided the trigger for some of the darker and more ignorant prejudices of elements of the Australian community to be given voice. In a world increasingly interconnected by the information superhighway, reports of those views and prejudices have been broadcast to our region and to the wider world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Why has this political bushfire spread so quickly? It has been suggested that it is a product of a sensationalistic media. Indeed, I would not for a moment suggest that the role of the media should be dismissed. That said, however, one cannot ignore the degree to which the scene was set during the last few years&mdash;indeed, in this parliament during the last term and in the months since the election&mdash;or the way in which we have seen, from time to time, sloganeering about political correctness, about the so-called Aboriginal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry and about the alleged Asianisation of Australia. I think it has been that sloganeering that has prepared the ground for  the phenomena we have seen in the last seven weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very thankful of and welcome the efforts of the Prime Minister today. But it was the Prime Minister who, in the first instance, started the debate about political correctness and who allowed all of these elements to get started. He did, as he pointed out in the House today, place some real caveats on his remarks. But to me there is no doubt that the scene that was set created the circumstances for what I regard as a poisonous flowering of bigotry and a poisonous flowering of racist views that we have witnessed in recent weeks. I do not think there can be any doubt about that. It has been the PM by his persistent&mdash;indeed, stubborn&mdash;refusal to directly confront the bigotry, confront the ignorance and confront the prejudice of the member and those who have voiced their support of her views that has allowed the debate to run away and to reach a point where the action that we are now taking today in this parliament is necessary&mdash;indeed, absolutely essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Yesterday, in arguing his credentials for rejecting what he called `ignorant criticism' of his public record on the issue, the Prime Minister reminded the parliament that he had repeatedly reaffirmed his commitment and the government's commitment to a non-discriminatory immigration policy. The sad fact remains that until today he refused to take action to kill this debate. The issue has certainly never been one of freedom of speech. As far as I am aware, no&hyphen;one has disputed the obvious right of the member for Oxley and others to express their views. The issue all along has been one of leadership: the duty of the nation's political leadership to confront what is so obviously wrong and so obviously un-Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6174">  I think the failure has been a double failure. It has been a failure domestically and it has been a failure internationally as we have seen this country suffer some of the worst regional commentary that we have seen for decades. The reaction of foreign governments to the debate has to date been muted. I think that reflects the maturity of the rela tionships that have been built up over the past decade, and even before that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be absolutely no doubt that reports of a rise in anti-Asian prejudice and racism in this country and the conspicuous absence of an appropriate response until today have inflicted long-term damage on regional perceptions of Australia. The potential damage has certainly been recognised by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), who over recent weeks has made a major contribution to the debate. I think his intervention has been both timely and forthright. It has been in contrast with the silence of the PM until this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad and tragic fact is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) is now writing letters to regional newspapers denying that the Australian government tolerates racist views. Attitudes, it must not be forgotten, and I do not think anyone in this House would question, are quick to form; they are often very slow to change. It has been the PM's conspicuous lack of leadership that has unquestionably damaged our interests in this respect. His silence has provided the oxygen for this debate to flourish in. I was pleased to read the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> this morning from the columnist Malcolm McGregor, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This debate is not about freedom of speech. It is about the core moral and ethical issues that set the tone of our society.</PARA>

I believe his cant and hypocrisy was exceeded only by that of the shadow minister, Mr Gareth Evans. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In listening to the debate, once the Prime Minister had spoken, we had a very quick decline from the facts. We had statements being made that are simply misleading. They will not stifle the debate. When you look at this motherhood statement, people in this chamber in their arrogance think that it is going to stifle the debate in the community. It will not. The truth is there has been a bipartisan policy all these years, and that is the problem. There has been no discussion on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bob Hawke said that one of his great achievements was to liaise with the Liberal Party and the ACTU to keep immigration and multiculturalism off the agenda. The truth is that the Australian people have never had the chance to speak or had their opinions valued. Mr Beazley said that he did not know what political correctness was if it was not what he described as the will of the people at the time. Of course it is not, and he knows it is not. That is hyperbole of the worst order. He knows that political correctness is the will of the elitists in society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you have here today is basically a battle between Australian nationalists and the internationalists. I would say that everyone who has spoken in this debate so far has been, without reservation, an internationalist. I stand as a proud Australian nationalist with outward looking nationalism. It does not threaten anyone, but it says that we in this country have the right to decide. I turn to this quote: </PARA>

It is interesting to see that Cheryl Kernot recently has been attacking the Prime Minister, just as the Labor Party has. Let us look at what Cheryl Kernot had to say in 1995. I will quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 23 February 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Democrat leader Cheryl Kernot yesterday defended John Howard's controversial 1988 remarks on Asian Immigration saying they "at least appeared to reflect a genuine concern" . . .

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The quote is there and Professor Zubrzycki will not deny it because he conceded it on a television program in which I participated quite recently. It is quite clear that those were his words and it is just nonsense to pretend otherwise. I do have a concern for people from different backgrounds who have come to this country. Anyone who makes a commitment to Australia in my view is welcome. However, it will not take the heat out of the debate if by doing this you are simply screwing down the lid and turning up the heat. The government has no option but to reduce immigration numbers&mdash;and the Prime Minister, John Howard, recognises it even if the rest of you do not. I can tell you now that the Prime Minister will be pushing for lower immigration numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example from this paper says that we affirm our commitment to maintaining an immigration policy on wholly non&hyphen;discriminatory grounds of race, colour, creed or origin. Those are fine words but the fact is that they are not true. I will tell you how we discriminate. It is quite simple and quite obvious. It is all done by government and it is a matter of where you put your offices. Firstly, if 50 to 60 per cent of immigrants currently come <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6176"> from Asia it is discriminatory against the bulk of the community. That is clear discrimination. If you open an office in one area and close one in another, of course you get a change; and that is discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also quite obvious how it has been done for years in Britain. A woman from Germany told me of the experience her sister had recently. When you go to the front office and apply, and the staff are so rude to you, people get turned away and say they will not bother. Then the immigration department can say that there is no interest when in fact the people have been turned away by rudeness. It has long been the ploy in the United Kingdom and apparently has extended to Europe as well. For various reasons to do with employing local people that does not apply in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have points on the family concessional scheme it clearly is a discrimination. Ask yourselves this, you pious posers: if it is a non-discriminatory scheme, why don't we get large numbers of people from Africa? The reason we do not get them from Africa is that we discriminate; we do not open offices there. Nobody who knows anything about immigration will argue with any of those points. They know they are true and they are discriminatory. It is simply nonsense to say we do not discriminate. The policy is highly discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to make a little comment about Aboriginal affairs because I represent more Aboriginals than anyone in this parliament. I get good support from them because I try to address their real issues. I might add that I have never seen much assistance from those Labor speakers. All they have done is give lip service to the Aboriginal industry. I might add that it is the Aboriginal industry, not Aboriginal people, that Pauline Hanson was attacking.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not Pauline Hanson's keeper so I do not know. I want to say that we have a lot of talk about cultural diversity. If you get out into rural Australia, you do not find it. You might think it is so in Melbourne and Sydney but for the great rest of Australia it is simply not so. The trouble is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that we now have politicians in this place, some of whom have spoken today, who represent city suburbs with a very narrow focus. I would say it is quite clear that they are not representative of the whole of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just consider the policy of our neighbours. I am sure that you all know what the immigration policies of our neighbours are. Malaysia has the policy&mdash;and it has taken numbers of immigrants&mdash;that it will take culturally compatible people. This means, fundamentally, people from Indonesia. They speak the same language and have the same religion. That is their policy. The policy of the Japanese is to take people of Japanese origin. Until recently, they were sourcing them from Brazil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy of all our neighbours is race determined. I am not saying that we should do that but I do not deny them the right to do that; they have every right. When I was in Kuala Lumpur recently I was talking to a small businessman, an Indian running a hire car service, who said, `We do not know what we will do if this present government ever gets defeated because if this government gets defeated we have nowhere to go.' Beneath the surface racism is entrenched and it is very real.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my election campaign I got a cheque and a letter from a Malaysian woman, obviously from a fairly affluent background. She said in a letter to me that she had never really encountered racism until she married an Englishman. His family accepted her but her family did not accept him, so they came to Australia. She went on to say, `I would not like you to think I was racist, Mr Campbell. Some of my best friends are Chinese. But I am telling you that if they get the numbers in Australia they will do to you what they did to Singapore.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is nonsense to talk about any sort of united view in Asia&mdash;it does not exist. If you want to see racism alive and well and entrenched, Asia is the place to go. I get sick to the back teeth of people talking about and deriding Australia. This is, by and large, the most tolerant society in the world, but it is a society that has to be consulted and which has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6177"> not been consulted so far. You will not achieve anything by trying to screw down the lid. All you will show is that you in this parliament do not represent the people and that they are not having their voices heard through you. It is quite clear to me that politicians have failed this country. It is now up to the people to do something for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make sure that we do address this problem and we do not have a situation created where anybody in this society runs in fear. It is not a one-way street. In the election before last, I was campaigning in Sydney and a New Zealand TV team asked me if they could tag along. The journalist, a very large Maori whom I would not have liked to tackle, said to me, `We have been filming in Cabramatta and we could sense the hostility; we were frightened.' That is not the Australia I want, and it is not the Australia that I am encouraging. It is the Australia you will get if you go down this road of mindless bipartisan policy which fails to address the real issues. If you fail to address those real issues, there will be trouble in this country. It will be on the heads of all you bipartisan frauds.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few brief comments. I do not intend to reply in detail to previous speakers, but as the last speaker for the government I am obliged to make some comments in reply to the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). To the member for Kingsford-Smith I would say: how dare you accuse my leader of fanning this; how dare you accuse my leader of setting the scene for this to happen; how dare you accuse my leader of a conspicuous lack of leadership; how dare you use this debate for grubby party political purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say two brief things. The first is that I have never done anything of which I have been more proud than to stand up in my country's parliament to give a maiden speech as a representative. There is nothing I have got more pleasure from than being a local member of parliament. The seat I represent is quite a different seat from that of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). Unlike his seat, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which has 6.4 per cent of people who come from non-English speaking countries, I have 22.2 per cent of my population coming from non-English speaking countries&mdash;one of the highest of any government member in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a very substantial Asian population that I represent&mdash;Malaysian, Taiwanese, Chinese. They display all the qualities that I admire in people&mdash;family, enterprise. I see how hard they try to be Australian. I see how much this country means to them. I see that the majority of them had no option about leaving their country. I see how much words can hurt them. I see how personally they take it to heart. As a representative, that hurts me incredibly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Words can be some of the most painful things in a human's armoury. There is an obligation on those of us who have the incredible privilege of being a representative in this place, and hence of having a platform from which to speak, to use words in ways that promote tolerance, not division and hurt. There is also an obligation on those people who have the privilege to report what happens to report it in a way that does not fan the situation but, rather, to use that position of privilege to perhaps moderate some things that otherwise could be very much against our country's interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stand up today as the last government speaker because the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) is in another place and I am his representative in this House. As a shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs for three years, I thought something should be said on Aboriginal matters particularly. I did not enter parliament to take a particular interest in Aboriginal affairs. It happened somewhat by chance when John Hewson rang me out of the blue and asked me to be shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs and then hung up. I was left sitting there wondering what on earth this meant. I got a lot of phone calls in the next 20 minutes, too many to recount here. But the one I remember was from the former member for Pearce, Fred Chaney. He said, `Congratulations, you've got a very tough job; it will change you.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6178">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had no idea what he meant, but it certainly did change me very dramatically&mdash;and it has changed me to this day. I guess the thing that changed me was trying to come to grips with a group of Australians who lived by and large in such incredible abject poverty&mdash;something I had never had to cope with&mdash;who had extraordinary disadvantage and who had, in many parts of the country, absolute mind-numbing boredom. The poverty was perhaps best illustrated by a place I visited on the Northern Territory-Western Australian border. When the 1991 census went through this community, the average number of people living in a two-bedroom house was 12; the highest was 27.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spent a brief period working as a doctor in an Aboriginal community just to try to find out what it was like, to learn something on the ground. I have to say that to go into a house of two bedrooms where 20 people are living is hard to imagine, hard to conceive. The disadvantage is institutionalised. In the south-west of Western Australia, at least back in 1993&mdash;they are the last figures I remember&mdash;three per cent of Nungas completed year 12. That is the lowest year 12 completion rate for any identifiable group of people anywhere in the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you have done to that group&mdash;not a traditional group of Aboriginal people but a group of people who are largely urbanised&mdash;is condemn them and the next generation to a continuing cycle of poverty. Of course, the mind-numbing boredom of life today on many out-stations, in many rural communities, is a major factor that we have no idea how to confront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I had one surprising memory of that time, it was the bitterness that Aboriginal people felt. And it was not bitterness at what had happened 100 years ago, or 150 years ago; it was bitterness over what had happened to them in their lifetime. It was bitterness over the fact that people in their 40s were actively prevented by state legislation from attending primary school&mdash;and in many cases that was not repealed till the mid&hyphen;1960s. It was fact that until 1963 people in the Northern Territory needed permission to marry or have a bank account. It was the fact that until the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> early 1970s in Queensland you actually needed a passport to leave a reserve, which meant you could not get work or education. I met a person in 1991, whom I shall never forget, who actually still carried what was effectively a green card with him. Because he had carried it for so long he could never get used to not carrying it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, all these together mean that we have an Aboriginal population in Australia between 35 and 60 years of age that by and large is totally uneducated. I say 60 years because some people over the age of 60 did receive a mission education. But that 35 to 60 years age group, the Aboriginal leadership today, the ones that are trying to run the organisations, just do not have the skills. That is, quite frankly, why we need separate programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own area of health, we have found by bitter failure that when you involve Aboriginal people in the design, implementation and ownership programs they have a better chance of working. Within a week of becoming shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, I met Lois O'Donoghue for the first time. She said something to me that I have never forgotten. She said, `Look, white people have been mucking up Aboriginal affairs for over 200 years. We would like a chance to muck it up for ourselves for a while.' I have not actually found a reply for that. I have been trying to think of one for six years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, unless you have specific programs to address the fact that three per cent of Aboriginal people in the south-west of WA are reaching year 12, unless you have specific programs to address the incredible health problems that we face, then you are going to condemn Aboriginal people to be a continuing underclass. I do understand the resentment some people feel, particularly when times are hard&mdash;and times are hard for nearly all people in rural Australia. But there is no way round it: this country did actively discriminate by law against Aboriginal people up until the late 1960s, early 1970s. And many of the people that are crying against us trying to redress that were silent at the same time when this discrimination was being shown.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6179">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not separatism. Overseas, those countries that have had the capacity to address the legitimate grievances and the legitimate hopes and aspirations of indigenous people have actually found that, if anything, it promotes national unity. It is when you do not address the legitimate hopes and aspirations that you get divisiveness. Again, in an area which has been so intractable and so difficult it would seem simple pragmatism to say, `Well, we have found things work better when we allow Aboriginal people to manage, determine and run their own affairs. Let's do what works in an area where so much does not.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion will not go as far as many Aboriginal people will want. It comes down in a climate that many Aboriginal people are finding difficult, in a climate where for many years there have been raised hopes that have not been met. But there is a genuine desire by people of goodwill&mdash;and that is almost everyone I have met in my time in parliament&mdash;to do something about this. But it does need a message that we are prepared to be tolerant; it does need a message that perhaps we can try to lift ourselves above the party politics occasionally. And it does mean that in a culturally diverse society such as this there is also one small society that does have a special place as the first Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion before the House. This is an ending and a beginning. It is the end of ambiguity on this issue. This parliament stands united today in clearly rejecting all and any forms of discrimination on the basis of a person's race, colour, creed or origin. It is the beginning of a renewed commitment to a strong, diverse Australian society, where difference between groups of people is celebrated and respected, not resented and resisted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equal rights does not mean equal treatment. This is where the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is so sadly mistaken. Australian society is diverse. There are many groups of people with many different needs and aspirations. Equal rights means a fair go for all those different groups of people, and that  means different treatment to ensure that all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians live the kind of lives they want. The Australian fair go has to embrace that diversity, not seek to destroy it by applying the same blanket treatment to everyone. Facing up to our past is necessary if we are to find lasting solutions to the problems of today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs I had the honour and the privilege of being in the audience on 22 August when the Governor&hyphen;General, Sir William Deane, delivered the inaugural Vincent Lingiari Lecture at the University of the Northern Territory, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Wave Hill walk off. This is what he had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To see the heart of the reconciliation at Daguragu as lying in Vincent Lingiari's pronouncement that thenceforth the Gurindji and "the Whites" would go forward as friends and equals, is to do no more than recognise what must be the final objective of any reconciliation between the Australian nation and its indigenous peoples.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>This is what the House has recognised in reaffirming its commitment to the reconciliation process between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians `in the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage'. That is, the profound social and economic disadvantage experienced by indigenous Australians can only be properly addressed if at the same time attention is given to the historical experiences that are the root cause of that disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why a responsible government response to the `stolen generations' inquiry would be to establish counselling services for people still desperately traumatised by the experience of separation and institutionalisation and provide funding to assist people to regain contact with family members who in many cases have not been heard of for 20, 30 or 40 years. This would be a simple, practical and relatively inexpensive way to enable indigenous people to take their places as productive, contributing members of their communities and of Australian society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By taking this stance against racism and intolerance, the House is not in any way limiting our respect for the principles of free speech. We are affirming the right of every Australian to free speech on the very sensible <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6180"> and practical understanding that with the right to free speech comes an obligation to exercise that right with great responsibility and caution. As the former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Anthony Mason, said at a recent conference: `Free speech must be balanced against other legitimate public interests.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the House is saying today is that those legitimate public interests include the right of people to freedom from persecution or discrimination because of their race. We are also saying that it is in the broader public interest that the existence of a racist undercurrent within a small section of the community should not be used by politicians for their own ends&mdash;not for personal political gain, not for party political gain, and not as a means of furthering a particular policy agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who make political capital out of the fears and prejudices of certain people in our community must not be allowed to use the very real problems faced by many struggling Australians to further beat up the prejudices and the hatred. For one thing, depriving indigenous people of respect and a chance to overcome disadvantage is not going to make things any better for the average non-indigenous family on a low income. That is a cruel, cynical hoax designed to draw attention away from the real problems that we face. No-one benefits, but indigenous Australians are forced to suffer.</PARA>

I have seven brothers and two sisters. My parents' migration to this country has enriched this country. My father was a bootmaker and a market gardener. He raised 10 children, six of whom had the opportunity of a university education, four of whom are in the teaching profession, putting back into the community benefits to the community. That story is repeated in every municipality in every suburb in this nation. That is what migration has done to this country. It has enriched this country for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 is special to all of us. It is pleasing that all sides <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of this House have in their policy respect for the principles of this act. This act is our bill of rights. This act makes us all equal. As parliamentarians, we should at all times strive to maintain the principles behind this motion and every subsequent piece of legislation in this parliament should respect the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must now give effect to this motion in every aspect of our considerations in this House for, if we do not, we are all diminished and the nation is diminished. In recent months it is fair to say that I for one, like many on both sides of this House and in other places, have been ashamed at the level that the debate has descended to. We cannot afford as a nation and as a parliament to be dictated to by the lowest common denominator. These issues are above party politics. These issues are deserving of cross-party support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a historic day that the parliament has finally moved to, as I said, `rule off'. This is an ending and a beginning. We need to go forward, respecting one another's differences, acknowledging that we are different, not all trying to be the same and not attacking people because they are not the same as us. I commend the motion to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PROCTEXT>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Debate resumed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (5.21 p.m.)&mdash;I want to continue the remarks I was making in regard to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill prior to question time today. At that point I was saying that what is really of concern, particularly to people in regional Australia, are the payments for Austudy, which are now at levels which mean that people in regional Australia find it difficult to have real opportunities of getting education at a tertiary level if they live outside a university city or town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, in my electorate of Braddon in north&hyphen;west Tasmania, there are many families who have to make a choice between which son or daughter can afford to go on to higher education. I was referring particularly to families on a taxable income of about $45,000. If they have two or three children who want to go on to university, it is well nigh impossible for them to ensure that their children can do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate which has centred on the level of HECS increasing as the prime reason why people may not go on to university is not really valid. When HECS was first brought in by the previous government, levels dropped off slightly but then rebuilt in following years. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6183"> If there is any slight decrease due to these changes to HECS, the levels will rebuild in future years. The real issue for youngsters in regional areas of Australia getting into university is Austudy and the eligibility cut&hyphen;off points for the living away from home allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, a number of young people have been very concerned about their opportunities. In particular, one person who has done a lot of work on the north&hyphen;west coast of Tasmania for students at the Hellier College is Rachel Duncan. She has presented ideas to me about the needs of education in regional Australia, particularly the north&hyphen;west coast.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But at the end of the day when we came into government we had to find a coherent, integrated policy which recognised the financial limitations as well as providing good education. The slight decrease in funding to higher education is in the vicinity of $1 in $100 for the first year and may move up to $4 over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes can be made in the higher education area and those changes will come about. Some university administrators have spoken to me about it, saying, `This will give us the opportunity to make the changes to make our university more efficient and effective.' So I am very supportive of the legislation because it provides a good education for a large number of our young people who want to go on to university and, at the same time, recognises the fact that the money has to be generated&mdash;and we had to address the huge debt which was left to us by the previous government. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.25 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Regardless of whether a huge debt was left by the previous government, real questions have to be asked as to whether these policy decisions should be a priority. Fundamentally, today we are dealing with the decision by the current government to aban <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> don the former single HECS rate of $2,400, institute a three&hyphen;tier system as high as $5,500 and, concurrently, ensure that people who post&hyphen;university earn a far lower level of income are compelled to pay at an earlier stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the interest of the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) in the contributions of the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), I was persuaded to take a further interest in some of the contributions from the government side today. The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) spoke about his university career and what it taught him about theoretical mathematics and statistics. He should talk to the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) because she put up two questionable statistical comments. Firstly, she asserted that there had been an increase in Queensland; and, secondly, she said it was essentially too early in the day to take much note of these statistics. The second point is only relevant if you come forward and posit a reason why there is this deterioration around the country this year. The fact of life is that if they are unpredictable in one year then, similarly, the same kinds of conditions essentially affect the statistics this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we are quite aware&mdash;the previous government was certainly aware and anyone who takes an interest in electoral statistics and population movement in this country would also be aware&mdash;of the demand in Queensland. So it is quite rational that there might be an increase in Queensland over and above national trends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, despite any supposed increase&mdash;and let us assume, for the sake of argument, that we ignore her proposition that the figures are unreliable anyway&mdash;we also have a situation in Queensland where, even with this supposed increase in the number of people interested in enrolment, there has been a very systematic decrease internally in science, engineering and a number of other faculties in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Braddon (Mr Miles) did a bit of pork&hyphen;barrelling by expressing great concern about the fact that rural students are deprived from accessing university. He described that as a dreadful situation and said <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6184"> that he was there fighting for them, et cetera. Essentially, at the end of the day he was saying we do not really have to worry about things; when HECS first changed there was a bit of a decrease `but it will all sort itself out', ignoring the fact that when the previous government introduced these changes, what was clear in the survey of who might be most affected was rural communities, rural students. That was fundamental to the analysis of what might have happened and, to some degree, did happen in the introduction of these fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, that survey of the possible impact said that socioeconomically deprived people, in combination with those in rural areas, were those who would be most ruthlessly hit by changes in the increases in HECS. So there is one sure recipe here to affect rural Australia and that is a significant decrease in the access of those people to university, and it is particularly pronounced when they come from poorer families in those regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other fundamental strain going through the coalition's contributions today has been: Labor failed to markedly move equity, therefore, let's make it more inequitable. They introduced measures to widen access and they brought in various schemes and some commentators said that they are more advanced than most countries in the Western world. All of these things did not lead to an extreme, marked increase in access of students from western Sydney or northern Melbourne or, as I say, of most relevance, rural and regional Australia. Therefore, let's make sure that we put more barriers in the way of these people. Let's return, as some speakers earlier indicated, to the Fraser and pre&hyphen;Fraser periods. Let's make it extremely difficult for those people to enter university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is behind this kind of mentality has been most eloquently put for the coalition by the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). He commented in the James Cook University newspaper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By and large, the wealthy in the community are the intelligent in the community and they have intelligent kids.</PARA>
<PARA>What he is really doing is trying to help Australia by making sure we only have intelligent people at university and, ipso facto, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the basis of Liberal Party thinking, they all come from wealthy areas. I think anyone who has done anything past third&hyphen;class history at school might question how everyone in society obtained or maintained their wealth was by being the most intelligent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dominant thinking behind this government's attitude is that it is really a waste of time trying to encourage people from the western suburbs&mdash;from Penrith, Parramatta, Fairfield, et cetera&mdash;because they are, as the member for Herbert says, `by and large the unintelligent'. That is what is behind this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw a similar comment in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Age</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the same paper in which I saw the last quote&mdash;from the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone. It was not quite as stark but it was going in the same direction. She says that there are no problems here:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No&hyphen;one asks people who wish to enter university, whether they are rich or poor . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There are no questions asked when they enter the door, so what is the problem? The problem, the opposition would maintain, is that there is going to be a very marked change in who goes to university through these mechanisms. People are going to be discouraged. Families are going to have doubts about whether it is of value. Families are going to ask whether they can afford to provide. Children are going to ask whether, if they are going to go to a university, they will get anything out of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of us might have broader concepts of what education is for, but a lot of these people who do not come from families that had previous family members at university are going to very clearly ask whether there is a pay packet in it. They are going to question whether the gamble is worth while and they are going&mdash;it is quite clear already&mdash;to make a decision that it is not. Despite the reassurances of the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) that the figures are irrelevant, that they are not a guide and that Queensland is going well, and despite the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) saying that it is all going to sort itself out with no problems, there has been a national trend downwards and there has been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6185"> an extremely pronounced trend on a regional basis in some universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the University of Western Sydney as the main example I take any interest in. It is certainly one of the worst case scenarios because its academics and administrators have not been backward in saying this is a crisis. Whereas the national trend is an eight per cent decline in people interested in entering university, for the University of Western Sydney it is 22 per cent. That is right&mdash;22 per cent less than last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not heard any reasons from those opposite as to why these figures are there. I have not heard any of the speakers opposite say, `Well, it is because the member for Lindsay was re&hyphen;elected and therefore people feel that the economy is going so well that they do not need to go to university any more. They are just going to walk into $70,000 managerial jobs.' I have not heard any real reason from those opposite as to why the University of Western Sydney's decline is so stark. There are other regional indicators in the same direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe in the North Kew branch of the Liberal Party they are not too worried about the reality of the University of Western Sydney, they are not too worried about those universities that are not as recognised, not as established, not as tied up to the corporate sector as universities increasingly become dependent upon that connection, but this university is of relevance to me&mdash;and it is of more relevance to some members from western Sydney than it is to me. As I have said on other occasions, transport patterns in western Sydney mean that students in my electorate have reasonable access to the University of Sydney and have better access than some areas to Macquarie University, but for students from a number of other electorates of members in western Sydney like Parramatta, Mitchell and Greenway the university is vital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the areas the previous government wanted to succeed in are characterised by the University of Western Sydney. That university is characterised by a significant regional concentration of students. They come from an area that is very distant from other institutions. They do not have alternatives and are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> basically dependent on a very pathetic private bus system. The university is characterised, in Australian university figures, by a disproportionate number of students whose background is non&hyphen;English speaking. A disproportionately high number of its students come from families that have not had previous family engagement in tertiary studies. I think it has the highest percentage of non&hyphen;English speaking background students of any tertiary institution in Australia. It is also important because it has a significantly higher proportion of female academics than other institutions. It is noteworthy that, despite the high unemployment in western Sydney, 50 per cent of the graduates from the University of Western Sydney found work in that region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new institution is being undermined in a very real sense by the policies of those opposite. This is essentially part of a broader scheme&mdash;I did note the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) deplored the fact that one of our speakers spoke about industrial relations but it is part of a broader agenda&mdash;for Australia's options in the future: a lack of faith in this country's ability to go up&hyphen;market, a lack of faith in education as a major ingredient of research development in industry and the Guatemalan-Honduran industrial relations solution is where Australia has to go, that a low wage, ill&hyphen;educated population is Australia's destiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the government's themes is that Labor has not had tremendous success; it sought to increase equity but its success has not been that great. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said about an hour ago that he recognised that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are the most deprived sector of our population. However, in its analysis of what has happened in this country, the Higher Education Council made it emphatically clear that one of the successes of the previous government was in creating access for those very people. It also indicated an increase in NESB proportions in universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, that proportion would be affected by changes in NESB numbers in the population. While there would groups of people of non&hyphen;English speaking background who still have an abysmal level of presence <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6186"> at tertiary institutions, participation overall would be affected by increased Asian migration and their participation in higher education. But the reality is that under the previous government, despite the fact that the low socioeconomic category did not increase its participation marginally in regard to the overall university population, there were certain designated categories where there were successes&mdash;namely, Aboriginals, NESB and women in non&hyphen;traditional areas of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that the inability to move more strongly in regard to increasing low socioeconomic group intake into universities will not be resolved by making sure that those people cannot get into university. That is not the solution. That is the way we cannot go. Unfortunately, because they are so ideologically driven, those opposite have the fundamental belief that things should pay for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the member for Petrie say that this policy shows the way in which we can get better contact between cost and purchase price. She assured us that people would be able to pay back their debt more quickly. She argued that there are thousands upon thousands of students out there, massing outside universities, whingeing and complaining that some people are paying more than others; therefore, we should increase the debt and make them pay it back more quickly. I have not seen that attitude reflected in the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trend in western Sydney is particularly severe. Other members have cited the situation in Victoria where there is a very pronounced downturn in the number of mature age students. People have spoken about Macquarie University which, to some degree, affects my region. Then there is the matter of tertiary admissions in Victoria as a whole. The situation is more worrisome and more obvious in some areas than in others, but this is certainly a national trend. It is generally going in one direction. There are no mathematical aberrations to indicate that what Labor is saying is wrong. There is a broad national trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter is interrelated with the growing international reality. I will quote some figures <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on two fronts. Firstly, I want to deal with the allegation made by those opposite that Labor's policies over the last 13 years were the root of education inequity in this country. They ignore, in a very marked fashion, the fact that the downturn in participation is an international phenomenon. They ignore the fact that the UK has even worse indications for the same period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">They Only Look Dead</EMPHASIS>, E.J. Dionne cites figures that show that level of education is even more important in this day and age in regard to the jobs people get and the incomes they derive. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between 1980 and 1990 the median income of all households in America rose slightly in constant dollars&mdash;from $28,115 to $28,906. Women continued to lag well behind men in their incomes, but while the average man working full&hyphen;time, year&hyphen;round <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">lost</EMPHASIS>  more than $1,000 in real annual income between 1980 and 1990, the average woman gained $1,800.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But these figures conceal exceptional differences by levels of education. Male college graduates saw their inflation&hyphen;adjusted incomes rise by $1,560 over the decade to $37,553. Men who only graduated from high school saw their incomes skid by $4,266 to $21,650. And men who didn't graduate from high school dropped $3,904 to $14,439&mdash;they lost over a fifth of their incomes.</PARA>
<PARA>He further states at page 41 of that book:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The median college&hyphen;graduate couple saw its income rise from $52,500 to something over $59,000 in the decade of the 1980s. But the income of the median non&hyphen;high school couple dropped from about $25,000 to $21,000, the loss in male income far outweighing the tiny gain in female income. In other words, in a decade the earnings of the family without a high school degree fell from about half those of a college family to just a little more than a third. Is there any wonder why there was so much publicly expressed resentment of "yuppies"?</PARA>
<PARA>This article is saying that in America&mdash;internationally&mdash;there is a pronounced connection between income and educational qualifications, particularly at a tertiary level, but even at the secondary level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6187"> The government is saying that they will set that connection in concrete. The government will ensure that those already on high incomes will have an even greater presence at university. They will ignore the fact that the percentage of people of low socioeconomic background did not rise markedly in universi ties in the period of Labor government. They will ignore the fact that of the actual expansion in university participation to 630,000 students, there was real growth in the numbers of those from working&hyphen;class and lower middle&hyphen;class backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will ensure that these people are disinclined to go to university because of the economic realities. They will further entrench the system whereby there is a direct and increasing connection between succeeding at tertiary level, earning high income and being able to produce a tertiary level student within the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is totally opposed to these measures. They are a recipe for reversing what little progress we have made on the broad front for people on working&hyphen; and lower middle&hyphen; class incomes. They are a recipe for ensuring that the concrete advances we have made in regard to women, NESB and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders will be reversed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is copping out when it says that all these problems will all be solved, that the most poverty stricken and the most destitute will be saved, by a measly few thousand scholarships&mdash;the number of which will grow to the monstrously high figure of 4,000 for a student population of 630,000!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion: this bill is a recipe for depriving people on lower and middle incomes of access to education. The government is going to entrench these provisions to make sure that this country goes down the low wage, low accomplishment road.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the changes proposed in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill, particularly those relating to the higher education contribution scheme. I am particularly concerned about the likely impact of these proposals on access to higher education by low income groups in our community. This issue is certainly causing a great deal of anger in my electorate, and I have no doubt that I am not alone in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at a News Poll taken in August this year, we find that 63 per cent of the News Poll respondents were opposed to these <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increases in HECS payments. These proposed increases have aroused widespread concern and opposition throughout the country, and rightly so. They threaten to undermine some of the most noteworthy achievements of the previous Labor government and they have been generally recognised for what they are&mdash;a set of divisive and reactionary measures, the impact of which will be, and this is a very important statement, to reduce the cohesion and inclusiveness of our society by erecting financial barriers to higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill proposes to reduce the threshold for repayment from $28,522 to $20,701 regardless of individual circumstances. One does not have to be very perceptive to imagine the hardship that such a measure will entail for many of the people affected. A salary of $20,701 is hardly generous, especially for young people who are establishing themselves for the first time in a career and facing the additional costs associated with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A tax surcharge at this time would be a particularly onerous additional burden. How much more onerous will it be for mature age students or those with family responsibility for whom no allowance is made in these proposals. Not only has the income threshold for repayment dropped, but the HECS obligation has increased, as a result of the legislation, at all income levels above the threshold. Everybody above the threshold will have to pay back their debts faster than would have been the case under the previous regime. Since HECS is essentially an interest free loan, students benefit by paying it off slowly. It means they enjoy the interest free loan for a longer period. Therefore, they are all disadvantaged by this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Particularly iniquitous is the decision to extend the new repayment conditions for HECS to all HECS debtors not just newly enrolled students. There are about 750,000 existing debtors, all of whom took on their HECS debt in the belief that the tax surcharge would come into effect at a salary level of $28,000. Presumably, they made their financial arrangements on this basis. Such retrospective legislation raises fundamental issues <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6188"> with ramifications well beyond the legislation now under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The likely impact of these measures will be to deter mature age people with family responsibilities from undertaking higher education courses. This has both an economic and social consequence. Many mature age students, especially women, are forced to cut short their education because of family or work demands. The opportunity to return to study often adds greatly to their self-esteem, their self-respect and their ability to contribute to the community. These people will face a double whammy from this government if they also have young children because their child&hyphen;care costs will go up&mdash;and that is a matter which we are about to debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that these changes will also deter some young single people from low income families and those whose chosen careers involve long additional training periods or low wages. These changes have to be viewed in conjunction with the announced changes to Austudy which will abolish or reduce eligibility for a quarter of all current recipients. In my electorate of Jagajaga, I calculate that more than 1,500 people will be affected by the Austudy changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Data from the Victorian Tertiary Admission Centre indicated that, after applications closed last month, mature age students, mainly women, are the main group affected by the budget changes to HECS. Applications from this group fell by 13 per cent. An even more graphic example are the applications for the painting course in the School of Art and Design at RMIT. In 1996, there were in excess of 800 applications. For 1997, there are 307 applications. This trend is reflected in art schools around the country. With the certainty of drastic staff sackings to follow, we will see even fewer being able to access these courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Universities with high numbers of students in the mature age category are going to be particularly badly affected by these changes. Latrobe University in my electorate is a case in point. Over a third of its students are over 25 and more than 60 per cent of them are women. At a time when it is facing a funding cut of $5.6 million, Latrobe University is also <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> facing a decline in enrolments, which the university estimates at 560 students. It also expects to have to sack 250 staff over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A related HECS proposal causing concern to my electorate and to higher education institutions in the electorate is the introduction of differential fees for courses to replace the standard rate now applying. From 1997 there will be three different contribution rates. Rates will depend on the cost of the course provision. The danger is that poorer students will opt for cheaper courses irrespective of their interests and talents. This is nothing short of madness. It is madness for the students and madness for the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal encourages square pegs in round holes, rather than the more productive approach of ensuring as far as possible that students are equipped to undertake the work for which they are best suited. This is in the interests of both the individuals concerned and society generally. It is yet another typical example of this government's economic rationalist agenda of letting the market run the country. One day, hopefully, they will recognise that governments have a role and a responsibility for higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There must also be concern about the way in which particular courses are priced under the new arrangements. Students of science, engineering and agriculture are going to be charged $4,700 for their courses. This is likely to be a disincentive for some students and is particularly worrying at a time when enrolments in these subjects are already falling. It also has potentially serious consequences for Australia's longer term economic prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rationale for the differential charging arrangements is flawed. They are said to reflect both the costs and the benefits of the courses, but in some cases these conflict. A very good example is nursing. It is an expensive course for universities to run. On the other hand, nursing graduates are not generally highly paid. Universities, in fact, are charging nursing courses at the lowest of the three rates, which means they have to cross&hyphen;subsidise them from other courses. What I am <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6189"> concerned about is that the universities will be discouraged from offering these absolutely essential courses. Differential charging makes assumptions about people's earning potential and patterns of work force attachment that were probably never valid but are particularly invalid in these times when work force patterns are undergoing such rapid change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These proposals will allow universities to offer 25 per cent of their places to full fee paying Australian students from 1998, a move described by one commentator, Simon Marginson, as `a safety net for the rich'. Can you believe the gall of this government that talks about protecting the disadvantaged? In this bill, we have a safety net for the rich.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If implemented, this bill will have serious detrimental consequences both for universities and for our society more generally. It is an attempt to replace some of the funds previously channelled to universities through operating grants and discretionary funding and now to be withdrawn in yet another coalition broken promise. I feel like a broken record every time I get up here to speak.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every time I get up here to speak, I raise yet another broken promise of this government. But this bill does not just contain one broken promise. It contains quite a few. This is what your government promised:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. To maintain the funding levels of operating grants.</PARA>

<PARA>Promise broken.</PARA>

<PARA>Promise broken. In their pre-election policy statement, they also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition is committed to ensuring that financial, social and geographic factors do not act as a barrier to higher education for appropriately qualified students.</PARA>
<PARA>They went on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will oppose attempts by public universities to introduce pay&hyphen;as&hyphen;you go fees at the undergraduate level as an alternative to HECS.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition's real agenda, it seems, was more accurately portrayed in the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit than in its election manifesto. Maybe the voters should have a look at the National Commission of Audit before the next election. The audit commission's recommendations included the suggestion that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth consider funding its educational responsibilities through a capped number of scholarships to students leaving year 12&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . these scholarships should replace all operating grants to universities and TAFEs.</PARA>
<PARA>The impact of cuts to operating grants will be exacerbated by the government's refusal to fund an increase in staff salaries. The Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of Latrobe University, Professor Michael Osborne, described the combined effects of these circumstances as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Higher Education Budget Statement . . . makes significant inroads into operational funding in part openly by direct cuts over the next few years, in part surreptitiously by refusing to fund a long overdue and well merited salary increase. . . The combination of cuts . . . will mean that the true level of the cutback for institutions is somewhere between 10 per cent and 20 per cent. . . This can only cause very severe dislocation.</PARA>
<PARA>Reduced funding to universities is forcing some of them to consider full cost recovery for some courses. The government has directed that undergraduate enrolments be quarantined from the effects of reductions. Universities will not want to cut enrolments in higher degrees by research, as students in this group attract additional sources of income. It is likely then that full cost recovery will focus on postgraduate studies undertaken by course work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Latrobe University, for example, is considering the introduction of full cost recovery for postgraduate courses such as psychology and social work. These are an essential part of these courses. Charges in these areas will affect students already enrolled, who could not have foreseen these charges when they began their courses. The combined impact of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6190"> cuts to university funding will be devastating for some students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposals, as outlined in its higher education budget statement and which are to be given effect in this legislation, will in fact turn the clock back 30 years. The government is walking away from higher education and returning us to the days when only a few people were able to go to university. This point has been ably made once again by Professor Osborne, who said of the government's statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can . . . be little doubt that this set of measures represents a strong deterrent to students&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how the government can believe in such a deterrent. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . especially those from lower income groups. It is a step down the path to elitism on the basis of wealth and deserves on this account the severest criticism. . . These budget measures have potentially catastrophic implications for all but the most prestigious universities.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>While this measure will assist some universities financially, its impact will be variable between institutions, with universities in rural and low income urban areas having much less capacity to attract full fee paying students than will the well-established city universities. It will be divisive within universities as well as between them, leading to the kinds of tensions between publicly and privately funded Australian students that are now evident between privately funded international students and publicly funded Australian students. This is a very sorry day for universities in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure clearly advantages students from wealthy backgrounds. Poorer students will be unable to afford full fees, and unable to borrow them in the open market. In conjunction with the more stringent conditions applying to HECS as a result of this bill, these measures can be seen as both economically and socially regressive&mdash;returning us to a situation in which, increasingly, higher education and all that goes with it will be the preserve of the privileged. As I have said, and will say many times in future, this is both economically and socially indefensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The damage inflicted by these measures will in no way be made up by the govern ment's sop of 4,000 merit based HECS exempt scholarships over the next four years for students from target equity groups. While undoubtedly they will be valuable to the individuals concerned, they do absolutely nothing to counteract the general impact of the changes proposed in this legislation. They are damaging to the universities, to past, present and future students and, most importantly, to our wider society. If the government is truly interested in governing for all of us, it must withdraw this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to get up and speak in this debate. I have always said that, of the things that I feel are really important in my electorate, the first is jobs and more jobs, and the second is education. Today education is the key to one's life chances. The more equitable our education system, the more the education system develops students to realise their full potential. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 will have a dramatic impact on my constituents and their ability to succeed in the longer term in the world of work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One of the proud achievements of the Labor government&mdash;and I know that government members have knocked the last 13 years of Labor&mdash;was that we increased the number of university places from something like 350,000 to 630,000, an absolutely phenomenal increase. As I have acknowledged before, one of the controversial measures that we introduced was the HECS charge: the idea that people who graduated should pay a portion of the actual cost of attaining their university degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure was very controversial at the time, because it had been one of the great Whitlam reforms to make tertiary education completely free. When I went out to talk to Labor Party members or members of the community, I always justified it on the basis that every dollar raised would be turned into expanding the university sector. I repeat: we increased the number of university places from 350,000 to 630,000. By and large, most people now accept that the idea of using HECS money to expand the university sector was a very worthwhile thing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6191">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I thought was very important during our 13 years in government was the notion that our nation's future really depended on the degree of success we had in educating and skilling our young people&mdash;that is, as a government and as taxpayers, it was really worth while to put a huge investment into particularly our younger people and, as a nation, we would reap that benefit through the years. The more skilled our work force was, then the better we would be able to succeed in trading and exports; the better we would be able to create jobs and have people taking up those jobs. I absolutely believe that is as fundamentally important in 1996 as it was then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government members seem to have this naive view that it is okay to extract more money from university students; after all, the chances are they will be earning more than other salary and wage earners will. Perhaps there is some validity in that. In undertaking an inquiry into officer education, with a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Officer Education: The military after next</EMPHASIS> tabled in the last parliament, we highlighted the situation facing graduates today as far as ADFA was concerned. Previously, when you got a university degree it was a passport to an instantaneous job. There were employers clamouring to employ you. These days getting a degree does not necessarily guarantee that you will immediately get a job, let alone the job of your choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you some figures, from 1988 and 1993, of the  percentage of graduates employed in the April after they graduated. In the area of science and physics&mdash;86 per cent in 1988, 51 per cent in 1993. In the area of computer science&mdash;94 per cent in 1988, 70 per cent in 1993. In the humanities field, 18.5 per cent of graduates were still seeking full-time employment in April 1989 compared with 22.5 per cent in 1990, 42.2 per cent in 1992 and 44.1 per cent in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this means, I suppose, is that graduates are not a natural cash rich cow in which to home in on. Even if there were an argument that we need to increase the HECS fees and to make the changes that the government has made&mdash;and I dispute that&mdash;even if I were to concede that argument, what is so bitterly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disappointing is that it all goes to consolidated revenue. Not one graduate benefits, not one university, no expansion and no increased research&mdash;they get not one dollar of value for all these changes. I think that is an absolute tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In this report on ADFA that I referred to&mdash;where we spend over $100 million on the most exclusive university in the land and where the cost of a graduate to the taxpayer is over $300,000&mdash;there is not one change being made. The recommendation of the committee that we replace the undergraduate program with an additional 1,000 places at universities right around Australia and introduce a scholarship scheme, which would have saved $50 million, has been completely rejected. So at that university, for the most expensive graduates we are producing in Australia, there is not one change, but for all other university students there are some changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Perhaps the most disappointing change is lowering the threshold where HECS cuts in. Previously, you had to earn $28,000 before HECS cut in; under this bill it is now reduced to $20,000. There are three differential rates for HECS: $3,300 per year, $4,700 per year and $5,500 per year. What is the impact of these changes in my electorate? I am pleased to report to the parliament that, increasingly, people in my electorate saw themselves as being able to go to university and to succeed at university. I have had many cases where, for the first time in a family, someone has gone to university and obtained a university degree. I have seen situations where older women have gone back to school and then gone to university and succeeded in a university course. I congratulate them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But, tragically, it was predicted that these changes would be a huge turn&hyphen;off. The University of Western Sydney&mdash;which I am pleased to say serves your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, as well as it does mine&mdash;which especially aspires to serve the people of western Sydney and sees its mission as having a responsibility to the people of western Sydney, has seen a dramatic fall-off in applications to do university courses. You have to remember that over 65 per cent of all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6192"> undergraduates at that university actually come from the western suburbs of Sydney. So two out of every three students come from the western suburbs of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about a fall-off in enrolments, we are talking about a huge drop&hyphen;off in the western suburbs of Sydney by young people. Enrolments have already fallen by 14 per cent. Let me go through the figures from the faculties: 41 per cent drop&hyphen;off in engineering; 40 per cent drop&hyphen;off in nursing and health, something that a lot of young women in my electorate and some men saw as a profession that they wished to aspire to; 39 per cent in humanities and social studies; 24 per cent in education; 14 per cent in science and technology; and 10 per cent in law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this means for my electorate, as the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said, is that we are returning to the days of the past&mdash;that is, you did not go to university because of your ability to succeed at a university course, you went to a university because of where you lived and what your parents did. That is a great tragedy. It is a waste of resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is the one that is losing out and in particular the young people in my electorate are losing out. We cannot afford that for our nation's future. I am bitterly disappointed at these measures and the impact that they are having in my electorate, particularly on the University of Western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I suppose the thing that signals that this government is a government of privilege, a government concerned to look after the wealthy and make sure that their children have a privileged place in this society&mdash;notwithstanding all the rhetoric or feigned disgust about $2 million salaries&mdash;has to do with the alleged freeing up of universities and allowing an additional 25 per cent of HECS paying places at universities to be set aside by universities so that they can charge full fees for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact in my electorate is this: if someone does not get into a HECS place because they have not got the sufficient marks in their HSC&mdash;by the way, I would like to send a cheerio call to all those students <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> currently under the grind of their HSC exams; I have some great empathy for them&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask you, Madam Deputy Speaker: how many families do you think there are in the western suburbs of Sydney which are actually going to be able to afford to buy a place for their children the way you would if you were in Vaucluse or St Ives or Rose Bay? Of course that is not going to be available to working class families. Already they find the impost of sending their children to university sometimes as much as the family can bear, particularly when they get a place in one of the universities located well away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures will not impact on Sydney University; they will not impact on the University of New South Wales. The oldest and richest universities in Australia will have sufficient prestige&mdash;and, may I be crass enough to say, endowments&mdash;to survive these changes.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The independent eligibility criteria for independent status for Austudy be reduced progressively to age 21 over the next four budgets. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6193"> </PARA>
<PARA>That was a bipartisan committee. I notice that some of the members of that committee still serve. Examples are Bob Charles; John Anderson, the Deputy Leader of the National Party; John Bradford; and Bruce Scott, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. We all put our name to that and the Labor government progressively introduced it. It is absurd to suggest that people who are 21 should be treated as dependants of their parents. At the time, the age was 25.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the changes to Austudy we are going to see the then government's implementation of this recommendation overturned. You will not be considered to have independent status until you are 25. How pathetic! What a turn&hyphen;off for people doing a second degree and for people who may have gone to work after leaving year 12 and who have decided to have another go, to suspend for a time their period in the world of work, and go to get a university degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those on this side of the House have a passion about education. I am not saying that over the 13 years we got everything right; clearly we did not. Clearly there can be improvements to the system&mdash;but we did do a lot of good. We certainly expanded the number of places and we certainly saw in electorates like mine and yours, Madam Deputy Speaker&mdash;and those of other members on this side of the House&mdash;a significant participation in university courses. We got away from the situation where it was restricted to an elite number of people, when your place at university was not determined by your ability but by where you lived and what your parents earned. That is what we are going back to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is saying that, as a nation, as we look to the year 2000 and all the opportunities that that presents, we can be such a lucky country; we can have thousands of young people who can have their potential unexploited as far as this sector is concerned and we will still succeed as a country. We can be a clever country but we cannot service one of the prime institutions that allows us to be a clever country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am appalled at this approach. I really am disturbed by the impact it is having. I say to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is at the table, that people in my electorate have read about this in the newspapers and I guess it has not really sunk in yet but I sincerely believe it will sink in over the weeks, months and years ahead. When people fully understand the way you are ripping off universities, ripping off university students and restricting entry into university, you will pay a price. They will not believe that this is a fair country or a lucky country and they will not believe that you are acting in the interests of all Australians. After all, that was not an election promise but certainly a responsibility of any government of this nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is one debate in this House which, frankly, I wish we did not have to take part in&mdash;I wish it had never happened. We have all heard from numerous previous speakers in this debate the actual changes to the HECS fee arrangements that we are objecting to. I will go through them again very briefly because of the old adage, `If you say things often enough, you may start to get sick of saying them but maybe people will start to hear them.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time that a few people on the other side of the House, particularly on that huge back bench, started to realise what really is being done by this government to university education&mdash;the significant increases in the HECS contribution for all new students, particularly for those students studying courses that will attract the top differential HECS payment. Currently there is a single rate of HECS set at $2,442 per year. This is to be replaced by three higher rates of $3,300, $4,700 and $5,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other big change is lowering the repayment threshold to make students start paying their HECS debt at a much lower income&mdash;at $20,701 instead of $28,495. That is an enormous change and is going to impact heavily on many people. The other main change is allowing universities to charge full up-front fees for places over and above what they call the target number of Commonwealth funded places, subject to the institutions having filled their places for HECS only undergraduates.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6194">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am in a position, as are quite a few in this House, of being able to look back to the pre- and post&hyphen;Whitlam days and the sorts of changes that occurred in our university structure in this country as a result of really understanding the need to liberalise, to open up, to remove the elitism from what had been a very elitist approach to university education in this country. As a result of that, we have seen enormous gains&mdash;many people in our community who have not been able to access a university education prior to this are now able to do so. I am fearful that we are seeing a return to that. This is the beginning of that whole process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crucial issue in higher education policy is to operate a student contribution scheme that does not create barriers to participation of low income students. The impact of the changes we are looking at will be to inflict major damage to the equity of access that has been the cornerstone of what Labor's higher education policy has provided. As I have just said, that evolved over many years after a dramatic shift in policy and understanding of the need to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes are all the more remarkable given that the coalition promised&mdash;I hate to use that word, because it is becoming very cheap collateral&mdash;before the election to oppose changes to HECS rules after a student had begun study. That is not the case. HECS paying students already in the process are looking at these increases midstream.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said a moment ago, I suppose it is yet another to add to that boringly growing list of non-core promises. When we talk about the regard in which the community holds the political process and those within it, what hope do we have when the new Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gets in on the basis of new standards of honesty to the community and to the parliament and we then get to the stage where we have core and non-core promises? What hope do we have in teaching our young people any form of respect when this place, through the Prime Minister, has this amazing attitude?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The pre-budget announcement of significant cuts to higher education was a pathetic, a weak and a cheap attempt to convince stu dents that not much had really changed, that the higher education budget had only been `given a little nick', to quote the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone). What deceit! It is really holding the community in contempt to believe that by sliding in a policy change of this magnitude in the way that it has been done that you are acting in an honest fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no doubt that the proposed changes to HECS and university funding will have a big effect on current students and an even bigger effect on those young Australians who hope to gain a university education in the future. The minister has quite outrageously sought to sell the introduction of a differential HECS charge as some sort of equity measure. The reality is that all students will face major increases, ranging from 35 per cent for students in relatively low cost courses up to 125 per cent for those in the top band. This will actually mean that some students will graduate with a HECS debt of $30,000 plus. This is just disgraceful!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A differential charge has the potential to severely distort course choices for prospective students. Anyone thinking about attempting a course in medicine or law will have to think very seriously about the very substantial financial risk associated with their choice of study. The problem is compounded by the prospect for many of those people of having to start repaying a large debt with an income well below average weekly earnings. It must be stressed that the lowering of the repayment threshold from average weekly earnings removes one of the key measures in the fairness of the system&mdash;the system, that is, as it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you see a policy change of the dimension that we are looking at here, it is like watching cracks in a structure. There is no doubt that this is the beginning of a whole new philosophical approach to the way this current government believes it ought to operate tertiary education in the country. This is only the start and that is what is worrying me. I do not know where on earth we are going to end up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake, the decision to move away from the average weekly earnings <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6195"> threshold opens the door to continued reductions in the future. Members opposite, in their successive speeches, can stand up with all the honesty they wish to muster and say that this will not happen, but I am really sorry, I and my electorate cannot afford to believe them. I do not know whether they are saying that this will not happen or whether their statement is a core or a non-core statement. It is getting to the stage where you do not know whether to trust what you have been told.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not beyond the realms of possibility that this government will seek to raise extra revenue by further lowering the repayment threshold to, say, the level of unemployment benefit. We have no idea how far they are willing to go. In that case, any student who has a job will be forced to pay back their debt&mdash;not a job of a particular level of income, but any job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This may be of no concern to the rich&mdash;or should I say the more well&hyphen;off parents?&mdash;or to the academic elite, but it is a huge concern to those students from the low income households who may be the first member of their family to attend university. The shadow minister for education and youth affairs is absolutely correct with this warning: a differential HECS will serve to further entrench certain professions as the preserve of the privileged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no reason why we should not believe that and see that coming. It is a return to the days when, as I can remember in my youth, most doctors, most lawyers and most professions of that ilk came from households that could afford to promote that sort of study in the first place. It has been a privilege in the last few years to see that not happen. It has been good for this country and it has been good for the families in it. I would deplore any action by any government that is going to begin the path back to that sort of situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cuts to universities will mean a reduction in the number of government funded places. As a result, many young Australians from ordinary families will miss out on places while those from the wealthier families will be able to buy a place if they miss out on a government funded place. The previous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> speaker, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), very clearly outlined the potential for that particular occurrence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fear that many students will find that paying full up-front fees is the only way to get a university place in institutions where this government has cut gross funding. Allowing universities to charge up&hyphen;front fees at the same time as reducing public funding must lead to the slow replacement of HECS liable places with fee paying places. We have seen an outrageous attack on the general funding to universities already in this budget, let alone the HECS situation. All we need to do is see continuing cuts in the general funding to universities for them to be forced to survive by taking more private market or full market fee paying than publicly funded people. They will be in a position where they financially cannot afford to do otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the government: be very careful of what you are doing here. You are playing with the future of our tertiary institutions; you are playing with the future of many of our young people who aspire to getting what is now the norm&mdash;a university education. This country should be proud of the process we have had and should be doing all to enhance it, not to devalue it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  policy decision is anything but `the provision of additional opportunities and choice for Australian students', as Senator Vanstone, the minister, would have us believe. She is conning us; she is not telling us the truth when she says that. But, unfortunately, anyone who dares to disagree with the minister on this subject cops quite a bit of abuse. It has been suggested to me that this is a classic piece of Aunty Jack politics: if you disagree with the minister, she comes out and rips your you&hyphen;know&hyphen;what arms off! I say that lightly but I say it honestly because that is how people out there are feeling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I represent an electorate where unemployment is unbelievably high, particularly for the young. As I said on a previous occasion not too far back, in the ACT we had a youth unemployment rate in September of 54 per cent. We also have a tertiary education process in the ACT, like in many other parts of the country, of which we can be extremely <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6196"> proud. We have, along with those two elements, a very high retention rate in our schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we should be doing is making certain that each one of those students who can progress through to university on a scholastic basis and a wish to better themselves has an opportunity to do so. It can be said by many that the ACT has high levels of average weekly earnings. That is true in many cases, but I assure this House that the electorate that I represent is not full of families with higher than average weekly earnings as an income. I represent a very large number of families who are struggling on one income or two low incomes in a mortgage situation where the economy in the ACT, with the help of this government, is now declining at a rate that is quite appalling and where, for young people to get to university in the future, the last thing they are going to be able to do in the majority of cases is pay a fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of this is the merit scholarship scheme, which has been invented by this government. It is their grand attempt at equity. Let me tell you, it is far from equitable. The merit scholarship scheme will initially exempt 1,000 disadvantaged students nationally from having to pay HECS, eventually reaching to 4,000 similar students in the fourth year. Given that current university enrolments are around 630,000 nationally, this scheme will provide a scholarship for less than one per cent of the student body when it is fully operational&mdash;not now but in four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a sham. It is totally misleading about the reality of the situation. It is a very poor and weak attempt to make up for what I believe they know: that they are putting in place with this bill a piece of policy that attacks, as I have said, proper equity of access for all families, all young people in this country, to the hope they should have, that is, a university education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt in my mind at all that this is the beginning of a return to the old days, as many other speakers have said&mdash;and we cannot be blamed for having this opinion because we are yet to see any evidence that anything this government says it actually <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> means and will carry out. We are heading backwards. We are going back to the days when people can get into university if they can pay. The number of people who can pay will continue to dwindle, and the people who need to&mdash;and wish to&mdash;get that university education will find it more and more difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we talk about a just community and society in which to live, I am absolutely at a loss to understand how on earth this government can expect the community to believe that they wish that, that they believe in that, that they hold that as a philosophy when they start to impose these sorts of policies on our community. I can assure the government and this House that the people I represent in my electorate are not impressed at all and will continue, with me, to oppose in any way they can the policy that is being brought down by this bill. I very strongly repeat my initial comments, that is, my total opposition to the changes that are being mooted in the HECS arrangements.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is at present debating the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, and that innocuous title will be something that many young people in Australia and people who want to do mature age training will remember for years to come because this is the bill that has put an end to the chances for many young people to get a university education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wide ranging effects of the budget cuts are already being felt by institutions of higher education. The National Tertiary Education Union has said that the federal government's changes to the higher education sector will make Australia the second&hyphen;highest fee charging country in the world for students in public universities. The government's policy to increase HECS charges will also mean that many will not even be able to afford to go to university. Furthermore, government policies mean that by the year 2000 there will be a 15 per cent cut in funding per institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just last week, I received a reply to a letter I had written to the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, Professor John Niland. I wrote to him about a matter that concerns both me and my colleague the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6197"> member for Barton (Mr McClelland) which is the prospective closure by the University of New South Wales of the St George campus of that university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The St George campus, as the member for Barton knows&mdash;and he will be speaking on this matter at greater length than I&mdash;fulfils a vital regional need for the population of south&hyphen;west Sydney, which is demonstrated by the fact that 70 per cent of the students in primary education at that campus come from the St George and Sutherland regions. Closure of this campus removes the only university facility in the St George and Sutherland regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people will say that tens of thousands of students go to university from that region and there are only about 800 full-time places at that campus, but the reality is that it is the only tertiary education campus in our region and, because of the cuts that the government is making, it will most likely have to close. It is not necessarily the fault of the university that it is going to have to close; it is directly the fault of the government making these cuts to tertiary institutions. The graduates of that campus from programs such as teacher education and sports science are well regarded by the employment groups that take them in. But it is going to have to close and they are probably going to have to go to Kensington to complete their studies. Professor Niland said in his letter to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you will be aware, in its August Budget Statement on Higher Education, the Federal Government put major constraints upon national tertiary education outlays such that many universities, including the University of New South Wales, are facing significant cuts in their Commonwealth operating grants over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other policy decisions by the Government, especially in regard to what have been normal supplementation and indexation arrangements, are also having a serious impact.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the professor's view, and it is true. In seven months this government has put a very large stake through the heart of tertiary education in this country. The undermining of our education system by this government is eroding many of the gains that the Labor Party was very proud it made. While the Labor government was in power we invested <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> heavily in creating an excellent education system. This investment saw the number of students in higher education rise over a 13&hyphen;year period from 340,000 participants when we came to office to over 600,000 at present, an increase of over 70 per cent. If our country is to take its place in the world as the clever country, as the country that can provide value added ability for the part of the world we live in through a flexible, clever work force, then people need to have good training. The decisions of this government for the purpose of short-term gains will put that at great risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government recognised that creating university places was only half the task. The other half was to make sure that everyone had an equal chance of taking up a place at university and completing their course of chosen study. To expand the university education system we brought in the HECS scheme, and we make no denial about that. We asked people to pay some money. We said that we thought that people who went to university at the end of their course would usually receive a better income than those who had not gone to university and should make some contribution. We set that contribution at a reasonable 20 per cent of the cost of the course and poured the money back into creating more university spaces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, people only started to pay the contribution once their salary had reached a minimum level of $28,495. We thought that was a way of saying: `You will make a contribution, and that is fair, but you will not have to start paying it back until you are earning a reasonable income.' We thought that was fair too. We thought it was a scheme that was reasonably fair all around. But this government has now said that graduates will have to start paying their higher education contribution scheme debt from 1997-98 at a lower income threshold of $27,700, and that is not fair to a lot of students. It is not fair particularly to a lot of young families where the husband or the wife has decided to embark on a tertiary education program to improve their family income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the people at universities now are mature age students. One spouse might be a low income earner and the other might be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6198"> doing a university course. They may have children. To say now that they are going to have to pay that HECS burden back at $20,000 rather than $28,000 will dramatically reduce the amount of disposable income some of those families will have. All students will face major increases, rising from 35 per cent for the students who are lucky, in a sense, to be in a relatively low cost course up to 125 per cent for those in the top band of courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So not only is the government going to make them pay the money back sooner or on a lower income level but the government is going to make them pay back more. We do not think that is fair at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two-thirds of the general student body at the University of Western Sydney, for instance, are the first members of their families to go to university. The HECS charges will undermine the role of those regional universities, which for some was the only access their family had ever had to tertiary education. The University of Western Sydney, as you so very well know, Madam Deputy Speaker, representing as you do a part of the area that that university covers, has had a reduction in the number of students applying to enter that university for the first time since the university was open. That is because this government in a sense is warning low income families off approaching tertiary education as a way to improve their position in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will now find that cuts to funding for universities will definitely decrease the opportunities for those without financial means. Only people from better off families will be able to afford to go to university. The government wants to assist that even more by allowing universities to sell places. One of the things we decided when we made some changes to allow universities to sell places to overseas students was to say that you could not sell places at universities to students who lived here in Australia. The reason for that was that we wanted to have an equal system. We wanted children from Western Sydney and children from the North Shore to have the same chance. We wanted the only test of whether you could get into university to be merit, not wealth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government has said now is: `We will have wealth. It does not matter whether you are pretty good at school. It does not matter whether you have worked hard. If you did not get a good enough TER your family can buy a seat for you at the table and that is all right.' It is not all right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It undermines the whole egalitarian thrust that we wanted to put into tertiary education. It undermines that egalitarian value that Australians have always liked&mdash;I must say an egalitarian value that the Liberal Party has never particularly liked. But you also wonder why the National Party is going along with this, because people from the country, farmers who have low incomes in cycles, will find that the regional universities that their children attend will slow down and the courses that are available at those universities will contract. The children of farmers will get back into that cycle where the only way they can get a good education will be to go to the big city, which is not what their parents would like. So one wonders why National Party members are supporting this piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be less incentive for students from lower socioeconomic groups, such as farmers and low income earners, to go to university. Aboriginals and migrants especially will be hurt when they know that the lump sum they will have to pay at the end will be quite significantly more than it is now and they will have to repay it quicker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year I presented four students in my electorate with the Australian student prize for academic achievement. The Mayor of Canterbury, Councillor Griffin, was kind enough to put on a small ceremony at the council chambers so that we could give these young people and their families due recognition. All the four students presented with those prizes were either migrants or children born of migrants. One of them was a girl named Katherine Lieu. She arrived in Australia only in 1979 with her parents, who were refugees from Vietnam. She is now studying medicine at the University of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These migrant families have struggled to make their way in Australia. This proposal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6199"> that the government is putting before the House now will make the struggle for such families even harder. It will not be a struggle for people living on the North Shore of Sydney and in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It will not be a struggle for people who live at Peppermint Grove in Perth, but it will be a struggle for lower income earners. It will be a struggle for people who have merit but do not have the money. If we want to see this country advance in the way that it should, we should be saying to people who have merit that that is the test for getting into a university, not how deep your parents' pockets are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These HECS charges will have a detrimental effect on the number of students studying for science and engineering degrees. Just recently, members will recall that there was much to do made by the government about Peter Doherty, who brought great credit to this country when he won the Nobel Prize for Medicine. He discovered a breakthrough in immunology that will lead to many kinds of vaccines which will help a wide range of people around the world who have cancer, MS and other auto&hyphen;immune disorders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peter Doherty trained as a veterinary surgeon. On the calculations that the government would make, his degree would cost him $27,500. That is how much he would have to pay back as his HECS contribution. But everyone knows that research scientists do not earn much money. So a person like Peter Doherty, who might be a lecturer or part&hyphen;time lecturer at a university earning $21,000, owes the government $27,000, which comes out of his tax every year and reduces his salary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who fix dogs and horses get paid a lot more than that. So in the future young vets might have to decide whether they want to do work which will advance humanity or go out and fix dogs and horses and earn more money. What a terrible thing it would have been for Australia and for the world if Peter Doherty had decided that he wanted to fix dogs and horses. It might have been alright for the dogs and horses, but it would not have been much good for the people suffering from cancer and MS.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This piece of legislation will put back the clock. During our 13 years in government we made changes which were generally applauded by the opposition at the time. We opened up the lives of a lot of people and we opened up chances for young Australians. We opened up chances for mature age students who went back to university because they could afford it and because they had the merit to get in. But that will now be very hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone who might have great merit but no money, for example a science graduate who gained a PhD and who would have had to study for about seven years to do that, will find that their HECS debt will be $32,900. There will be a lot less incentive for someone to do a science doctorate in a research area which will not lead to a high income if they have to pay off $32,000. These increased charges will encourage people not to go into the research areas which will benefit humanity, but to go into the areas where they can make more money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of a differential charge depending on what course you decide to study will certainly entrench certain professions as the preserves of the privileged. I think that is wrong. The option to study medicine was available to anyone who met the requirements to get in. But now, when Jane Smith from Lakemba is filling out her UAC form next year, she might end up having to turn the clock back. Instead of having the opportunity, if she is a clever young woman, to study medicine, she might decide to do nursing because it is cheaper and it is all she can afford. The reality is that she should have been able to choose nursing or medicine, whichever she had the merit to do. The cost should not be the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea of relating fees to expected earnings causes a lot of problems, especially in the field of law. There are long waiting lists to get into the college of law. All of these things will add up to a lot of difficulty in administering these courses and a lot of unhappiness for the people wanting to do extra study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6200"> Postgraduate students will be hit. Everyone knows that in today's highly competitive workplace to get certain positions or promo tions you need to have a postgraduate degree. The effects of these cuts will be that by 1998 access to masters degrees will have been irreversibly reduced. Fee paying undergraduates will be able to replace subsidised students by as much as 25 per cent of the total undergraduate enrolment at a university. Once again, the government is selling these places to those who can afford it, not having merit as the barrier to overcome to get into university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was reported recently in the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that there had been an 8.25 per cent decrease in the number of year 12 students from New South Wales and the ACT applying for university places. Students are already being discouraged from applying for courses by this government because of its mean&hyphen;spirited approach in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Universities are becoming desperate. We now find that very important universities in this country like the Australian National University, to whose council this parliament appoints people, is resorting to soliciting for donations from former students to try to make up the shortfalls caused by the federal government cutbacks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quality higher education will be severely damaged and will reduce the effects of the extra positions that we were able to create&mdash;the extra quality&mdash;when we were in government. We are seeing some short&hyphen;sightedness on the government's part which, unfortunately, will turn the clock back in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many instances getting into university now means that we are going back to the situation where what mattered was not how good you were but how well off your parents were. That will mean that people from my electorate, people from your electorate of Prospect, Madam Deputy Speaker, and people from the electorate of my friend the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) will find that their children will have a harder time. It is that sort of mean&hyphen;spiritedness that the people of Australia would think better of us for putting aside. So I do not think we should pass this bill, and I wish the government would reconsider the unfortunate circumstances in which they have placed people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A little earlier in the debate, the member for Chifley (Mr Price) spoke of the trauma of a number of students undertaking their higher school certificate exams. He said his heart went out to them, as does mine. I remember that as a particularly stressful period. Indeed, in cross&hyphen;comparisons of stress, it was far more stressful than even a Labor Party pre&hyphen;selection. It is quite a traumatic time. The fact of the matter is that all students are undergoing equivalent stress. Next year that will be somewhat different&mdash;at least for 25 per cent of the students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before this period of late October and November next year, the universities will want to know their funding base for the following year. They will want to know that they will be funded for the 25 per cent of fee paying places which they will now be allowed to introduce as a result of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill. We can rest assured that those universities will admit students on the basis of their assessment prior to undergoing the HSC. So some 25 per cent of students will be able to breathe a sigh of relief and feel a little less stressed because they will have secured a university place. Literally, those 25 per cent of students will be those whose mums and dads bought their places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 26 October at a Liberal Party convention, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that under the government's plans Australian students would be able to do what their overseas counterparts could currently do and buy a university place, in addition to having access to funded places subject to HECS. But it is those 25 per cent of places which will be bought that will give some students a significant advantage or privilege in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) said, not too many of those students will come from our electorates. They will come from the north shore, the eastern suburbs and the wealthy areas. Regrettably, we are introducing a significant demarcation based on privilege. The remaining 75 per cent of students will have what would otherwise be 100 per cent of places available to them reduced by 25 per cent, because those 25 per <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6201"> cent of places will be sold from underneath them. On any objective analysis, that is chronically unfair and, indeed, a significant retardation of the future and universal development of Australia's talent base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of us here are familiar with the background to the higher education contribution scheme. It was introduced as a result of a recommendation of the committee on higher education funding in April 1988. The principle behind the HECS was that education was not only to the public benefit but it also bestowed a private benefit in access to career opportunity and hence it was appropriate for students to contribute something to their own education. That has pretty well obtained universal acceptance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the challenge, successfully met, was in keeping the HECS level at one which did not preclude or impose an undue financial burden on students such that, provided all Australian students, as the member for Watson said, satisfied the merit test of academic achievement, they could access university and hence open the door to their dreams and career aspirations. The repayments required under the Labor government's regime did not lock into place until those aspirations were realised&mdash;until the student reached a level considerably above average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has reduced it to a level of even below basic minimum award conditions today. Virtually as soon as a student leaves university, even if they have a particularly low paying job, they will be required to start locking into the repayment regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum to the bill says that current students&mdash;those enrolled pre&hyphen;1997&mdash;will not have any unanticipated fee increases. Their current costs will be frozen. That just is not the case. There are 750,000 people with HECS obligations, together with about 400,000 current students, and perhaps as many users again of the higher education system since 1989. Because the threshold has been lowered from approximately $28,000 to $20,000, the obligation to repay is going to be locked in much earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian National University has estimated that the obligation to meet the earlier payment deadline will cause increases <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of between five and 12 per cent to the HECS debt of existing students. It is unquestionably a misrepresentation to say that current students will not be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On pure numbers participating in this debate, the opposition would win hands down&mdash;there were only four speakers, together with the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), for the government. That is an indication in itself, one surmises, of the uneasiness many genuine government backbenchers have with the government's actions. The rationale for this bill, given by several speakers, including the Prime Minister, is what the Prime Minister said to the Liberal Party convention on 26 October:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the social justice of saying to a person on $30,000 a year whose children don't want to go to university . . . we are going to use your taxes to ensure that people on $150,000 a year don't have to make any contribution to their children's university education.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just a silly analysis in the first place because less than one per cent of wage earners earn $150,000. Presumably you are talking about less than one per cent of the university population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamentally, the Prime Minister's comment is extremely short&hyphen;sighted. People earning $30,000 a year would say, `We appreciate that we are in a very competitive world.' Education has given Australia a very significant competitive advantage. We are all in it together. The interests of Australia are our interests. It is why our manufacturing base is based on technology and skill. It is why, if I become ill, I will have access to high quality and technologically advanced medical treatment and skilled medical practitioners. We have scholars teaching languages and the social sciences so that we can relate with the rest of the world and, hence, participate as a member of the international political community and the international trading community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6202"> It all arises from education. The more talented your people are, the more successful a nation has to be. Even though one's children may not be going to university, everyone benefits from other children going to universi ty because of the effect it has on our overall skills base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most Australians are intensely proud to see their next&hyphen;door neighbour's children go to university. I frequently go to functions and am met by name&hyphen;droppers&mdash;name&hyphen;droppers in the most pleasant sense: aunties and uncles name&hyphen;dropping their niece or nephew who has been admitted to university. They are intensely proud of that fact, and so they should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's comment that there is some sort of resentment on the part of lower income earners to make a contribution, however slight that may be when compared with the totality of overall government expenditure, to develop the skills base of other children, is extremely short&hyphen;sighted. He is fostering&mdash;with respect&mdash;selfishness and, what is worse perhaps, it is the commencement of fostering division and resentment. That is an unhealthy thing to introduce into Australian society. It has not existed up until today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The structure of the bill itself is based on an extremely complex banding system. The member for Watson went through that charging structure. Basically, HECS contributions will jump from $2,487 currently to $3,300. If a student is undertaking computing or a science course, that figure will jump to $4,700. If a student is undertaking law or medicine or one of the government's perceived high income earning courses, it will jump to $5,500 or the equivalent of $11,000 gross for a family's budget, depending on their income level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever it is, in anyone's book, $5,500 or $11,000 over a five&hyphen;year period, if they are undertaking law or medicine, it is a significant additional burden that a young person will have as soon as they finish university. That is a time when they are thinking about setting up a practice and possibly thinking about setting up a home. It will be a significant disadvantage for very many Australians. Again, it will not be for those who are fortunate enough to have their parents pay the HECS contribution&mdash;but there would be very few students in my electorate who would have that luxury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is, as a number of speakers have pointed out, that already there has been a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decline of about 8.25 per cent in the number of students from New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory who have applied for university places. An article appearing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 4 October this year reported a spokesman for the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, as agreeing that that drop could be put down to the higher HECS charge. That was an astounding admission. It indicated the commencement of a fundamental structural change in the skills base of the nation. Effectively, in one year, the government has caused, by its cuts, an 8.25 per cent reduction in the potential future skills base from New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That will have a significant effect on teacher education, particularly on those in the expensive band subjects of science and computing. On 2 October this year, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, said that the government would begin a review of the university education of teachers. On 23 October he was reported on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> as saying that Australia would face a teacher shortage by the year 2005. Indeed, Barbara Preston, a researcher for the Australian Council of Deans, has said that there will be a 5,000 teacher shortage by the end of this decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, what is happening in my electorate of Barton with the St George Campus of the University of New South Wales is particularly alarming. As a result of the government's cuts&mdash;although we are still waging the fight&mdash;it looks as though the days of the campus could be numbered, and it is one of the premier teaching institutions in Australia, indisputably so in primary education and in the technology it utilises to assist primary teachers to communicate with their students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a document prepared by the University of New South Wales called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Options 2000</EMPHASIS>, the university said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of the Government's Budget statement on higher education has dealt the University an enormous challenge to survive and prosper in the face of significant funding cuts. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6203"> </PARA>
<PARA>Lest there be any doubt that the government's actions have caused those problems, I can say that they certainly were not there until this government's budget cuts&mdash;some of which are to be implemented by this bill&mdash;came into force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole shift in the higher education policy has meant that universities will become effectively private enterprises chasing the dollar. Obviously, if you are going to attract the dollar, you need to market yourself. Hence, in this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Options 2000</EMPHASIS> document, there is a reference to the need to attract high quality students. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The University of New South Wales' ability to attract high performing students will be reliant on its national and international image as a university of substance with high educational standards.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the report it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the belief . . . that students are attracted to a university which is seen to contain only the most prestigious faculties and the most able staff.</PARA>
<PARA>The emphasis of these universities, of necessity&mdash;because they are being transformed overnight into private money&hyphen;making ventures&mdash;will be prestige and image. They are not about educating our future talent base as required by our society generally; they are about concentrating on the glamour courses because the glamour courses attract those funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably and, I believe, short&hyphen;sightedly, the University of New South Wales does not see the St George Campus as a glamour course provider. Nonetheless, it is these cuts which has caused the trauma to the university system. By and large, it is the regional universities which will suffer in the short term but, longer term, the inequality being introduced into our education system and the reduction in access to training will affect the talent base of the nation as a whole.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.14 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak this evening not just about the specifics of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill but of the principles that underlie it. It is always important to try to establish the context in which policy, if one can dignify this bill with that name, is made. It is important to recognise that before the government brought in these changes we had <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> one of the most accessible higher education sectors in the world&mdash;one which was growing and one where more and more people were getting access to higher education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember in the early 1980s that we had only 350,000 higher education students. It has risen to 630,000 this year. That is a very significant increase which is driven partly by increases in funding but also by state governments putting their noses to the grindstone and ensuring an increase in school retention rates. We have seen a revolution in access to higher education and the retention of students to the point where they can contemplate undertaking higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see here is a clear reversal of that trend. I think we all want to ask why. Why is this happening? What is the philosophy that underpins this decision? Surely it is not possible that the conservatives want to reduce Australian citizens' access to higher education. I think it is an attempt to simply reduce access for some citizens. It is worth examining the ideology that lies behind the Liberal's cuts to higher education funding, particularly in light of today's debate on tolerance and inclusiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear to me from listening to the ministers responsible, to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on radio recently and to other members who have spoken in the House that the conservatives see education principally as conferring individual financial benefit and, therefore, it is more appropriately funded by the individual, regardless of their ability to pay, given the benefit that education is said to confer on their income earning capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the last speaker, the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) indicated, the Prime Minister went so far as to say that those people who do not, for one reason or another, currently participate in higher education resent paying taxes that go to higher education. I must say that that is a sentiment that I have never encountered. Every family that I have encountered, rich or poor, irrespective of whether or not they have a history of participation in higher education, understands the importance of higher education, university education in particular, not just to their own family members&mdash;their children or indeed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6204"> themselves if they were fortunate enough to find a mature age place&mdash;but to society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has never been any doubt in my mind that this was a tax dollar that nobody minded going to this very important enterprise in our community. I think the government has overlooked the general public good that flows from higher education. It is a theme that I have outlined in recent days and will return to over and over again. It is missing in the government's thinking in terms of education&mdash;higher education or school education&mdash;housing and health. General public good is derived from comprehensive and quality higher education. Individuals certainly benefit, but as a whole we all benefit more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was thinking about this it brought to my mind John Kenneth Galbraith's gloomy aphorism that `policies of this kind lead to private opulence and public squalor'. The more you withdraw public funding from education, health and housing and insist that the individual pay his or her way the more you will end up with private opulence and public squalor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reading between the lines&mdash;and it is interesting that so few members of the government wanted to speak on this bill&mdash;it is interesting to find that part of the ideology behind this legislation is not just about the individual contributing, the individual financial benefit and the ignorance of public good but an attempt to marginalise and scapegoat so-called minority groups. We have seen it happen with Aboriginals in this country. We have seen it happen with migrants. Another handy target are the unemployed. There was a lot of bashing of unemployed people when the government first got in. They have been silent recently. Students and academics also make a handy target. It is easy to stereotype the others in the community&mdash;the people who are not, according to the Prime Minister, mainstream.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was thinking about the way this influences education and other policy, I was reminded of the notorious memo that Pat Buchanan, a far right wing presidential candidate until he was knocked out, wrote when he was a speech writer for Nixon. He sent a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> memo to Nixon saying, `If we tear the country in half, we can pick up the bigger half.' In my view that is precisely what is underpinning, albeit in some cases unconsciously, the programs and the philosophies of this government. It has all the hallmarks of an exploitative and cynical attempt to divide and conquer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dividing and conquering politics is very familiar. We have seen it in the United States. We have seen it in countries that have turned to totalitarian governments. I am not suggesting that it will go that far. But to tear the country in half and pick up the bigger half is really what the Prime Minister is talking about when talks about the mainstream and the rest. As Hughes put it in his excellent essay:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To divide a polity you must have scapegoats and hate objects&mdash;human caricatures that dramatise the differences between them and us.</PARA>
<PARA>Students make a handy target especially if, as the Prime Minister argues, they are children of the ratbag middle class. They are the children who run around with long hair, dirty clothing, look a bit worse for wear and shout and yell and thump on the Prime Minister's car. That is all the more reason to marginalise them. Again to Hughes's colourful imagery&mdash;and I think this is a critical point in our history:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like fungal spores in the soil, these repressive tendencies are always there&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the repressive tendencies in the community&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">always latent, always capable of fruiting overnight given the right conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if you encourage bigotry, separatism and division there will be people in the community who will respond to that vigorously. That is what we are seeing at this moment. In fact these latent spores that Hughes talks about, and which are in our community too, have a tenacity that tends to deflate one's optimism about moral progress in the 20th century. Listening to the Prime Minister today deflated any optimism I had about moral progress. A more limp&hyphen;wristed, milquetoast response to such an important issue I have not seen in a very long time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6205">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This kind of reaction that we are seeing following the speech of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and the Prime Minister's half&hyphen;hearted response to it, talkback radio's response to it and the encouragement that has been given to these fungal spores shows that this kind of reaction lives by personifying the social fears of others. It is handy to scapegoat someone: `If I am frightened, it is better if I can put the label on someone else. If I am fearful of my future it helps to be able to say that it is the fault of the Asian migrants, the Aborigines, the ratbag students or the migrants.' It is somebody else's fault. It enables people to step back from the problem and not identify the real source of that problem. It gives human shape to the amorphous anxieties of our time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tie this back to education because not only are they a target in this budget&mdash;the common good is being set aside&mdash;but the very tangible effects of these views are already seen in our education exports. I am sure many members would have heard the reports recently in Singapore, when our major institutions were holding an education expo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was Minister for Education in Western Australia when we first started to export education places into the region. We were very proud to be at the forefront of that, but we knew that one of the things we had to do was to send a clear message that we did not in any way tolerate racism or bigotry in our country. We would do everything we could to make the people from the region feel at home. We acknowledged that in the past there had been policies in our own country; indeed, there remained attitudes that were hostile to people, particularly people of non-English speaking and of Asian descent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That message has been undermined to the extent that, at that education expo just a couple of weeks ago, former students who were alumni of Australian universities and prospective students were expressing a great deal of concern about how comfortable today's Singaporeans would feel undertaking studies in Australia. That is a great shame. It is a great disgrace that the current political debate has already produced that response.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not unsophisticated or ill-informed people, as the Prime Minister would have us believe many of the commentators in the region are. These are people who know Australia. They have lived here, and they understand that there are sentiments in this country which can be exploded into hostility. They do understand, too, that a leader can quell them; a leader can calm them; a leader can heal them. They also know the Prime Minister has actively and deliberately not done that. In my view, he did not do it today either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important that we look at the changes to education that we are contemplating here with an eye to those sorts of philosophies, principles&mdash;if you want to call them that&mdash;and certainly attitudes that sees education as principally for individual benefit and, therefore, to be funded by the individual, that ignores the common good and is prepared to marginalise students and academics as if they were the other. As I say, the strand of bigotry that we have seen emerge in our community in recent days will not give comfort to the future of higher education in our region either. It is one of the fastest growing exports that this country has and is dependent on continuing higher education standards being maintained for Australians&mdash;citizens of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess when you look at the attitude of the members opposite, the minister and many who have spoken, you detect what I would call a pattern of privilege. Perhaps it is not surprising when you consider the make&hyphen;up of their frontbench. Many have had an elite private school education and parents who, even now, can afford to pay for easy access to university. I must say I was stunned by Senator Herron's comments. When one of the other senators asked who in the Senate had a HECS debt, he put up his hand and said, `Well, I do. I am paying for my daughter's HECS fees.' There are not too many Australians who can afford to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think a ministry that contains ministers who do not understand that for most people HECS is a very personal debt which you will have to pay off over time and competes with other expenses in your life is someone who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6206"> does not understand mainstream Australia. So-called support for the battlers is undermined by these views. I think many of the members opposite fail to comprehend just how serious these problems are for people on low incomes. They speak the rhetoric of looking after the battlers, but hit them on every front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I can see here is that the government is hoping that these battlers&mdash;`mainstream Australia' and the various phrases that are used&mdash;will believe what the government is saying but not what they are doing. These increases in HECS charges, the reduction of the HECS threshold, the differential HECS and the increase in debts overall will hit low income earners most&mdash;not only those who in the future are low incomes earners but those who are currently low income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite, the Prime Minister and his ministers, spend a lot of time talking about family values to the point of hypocrisy and cant. It makes a lot of people puke&mdash;to put it politely. Clearly their actions show that they value families little. They talk about family values all the time, but their actions show that they value families little&mdash;certainly not families who have not had a history of higher education, certainly not families who have to pay the higher costs of child care, certainly not families who will have to pay more for their medicines, certainly not the families who go to government schools. These families are being ignored. So which family values are being looked after here? We want to know from the government how they believe changes to HECS, increases in HECS, will assist families&mdash;battling or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn to the specific effects of these changes, the increases to HECS payments, the differential HECS, the lowered HECS repayment threshold and the cuts to university funding. These changes have been outlined by several speakers, so I will not revisit them. But I think it is important to underline the consequences of these changes, since members opposite appear not to understand them. In fact, apparently they care less about them. I think the fact that most of the members did not choose to speak on this bill means that the ones with good hearts are seriously ashamed of what they are doing, and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the rest apparently believe the rhetoric of their government without intelligent examination of what this will do to our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will just look at some of those consequences for both individuals and the nation as a whole, because we need to look at both. Firstly, talent will be diverted from low paying occupations to high paying ones. Students who otherwise might have contemplated going into occupations that did not pay very much will suddenly have a big HECS debt to pay. Science and engineering are a classic case. That talent&mdash;the talent that should be devoted to mathematics and physics and medical research&mdash;will be diverted into areas where, while the HECS charges might be equally high, the income earning potential will be higher. That is a reasonable economic decision, and I would have thought the free market economists on the other side would understand that. Some of our brightest and best will be diverted away from areas where they should be studying into areas where they can make a quid.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to invite him here; I will come to invitations later. Since the last time we spoke about this matter, the member for Swan organised a meeting in his local area and wrote to residents in Guildford. His letter stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of inquiries from residents of Queens Road South Guildford about noise studies and aircraft operations in and around Perth Airport, I invite you to a meeting to be held at my electorate office on Wednesday 25 September 1996 from 5.30 to 6.30pm.</PARA>
<PARA>This meeting was the subject of a report in the local paper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Midland Reporter</EMPHASIS> , of 15 August. At page 8, under the headline `Noise meeting waste of time', it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Guildford Airport Action Group members have called a recent meeting with Swan MHR Don Randall over aircraft noise compensation a waste of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Spokesman Pat Houston said residents did not learn anything they did not already know.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government angered local residents when it announced in August an airport noise <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compensation package promised for Perth would not go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Ms Houston said the meeting achieved nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We knew before we went it would be a waste of time. We just went to put our point of view across.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Don Randall has to say we're not going to be compensated to follow his party line."</PARA>
<PARA>That is the key point. Mr Randall, the member for Swan, stands up for those people who live in the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and who are eligible for the airport noise compensation regime, but he will not stand up for people in the seat of Perth or the seat of Swan. In the course of reading this very interesting article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Midland Reporter</EMPHASIS> , I saw this reference:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ms Houston was also upset that local people had to prove where they lived to attend the meeting.</PARA>
<PARA>This triggered my forensic application, so I obtained a copy of the letter of invitation that Mr Randall had sent out to residents of Queens Road, South Guildford. I discovered in the penultimate paragraph of his letter that he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This invitation is only being extended to residents of Queens Road South Guildford. To ensure this will be an orderly and informative meeting, attendees will be required to provide identification that they are residents or owners at Queens road. Those who do not qualify on this basis are asked not to attend.</PARA>
<PARA>What a very edifying paragraph in the member's letter inviting residents to a community consultation! I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure an orderly and informative meeting, attendees will be required to provide identification that they are residents or owners at Queens road. Those who do not qualify on this basis are not asked not to attend.</PARA>
<PARA>In this new era of free speech, if you are a backbench member of the Howard government and a member of the community wants to come along to your office for a community consultation, they are required to show their Australia card before they walk through the door or, worse still, they are required to show their mortgage number or their tenancy agreement number.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6208">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You need your mortgage number stamped on your head before you can go to a local member, or an adjoining local member, and say, `Excuse me, your government has made a decision that I do not agree with. You support your government's view that you can have airport compensation for Sydney, but you can't have it for Perth.' Before you get in the door, you are obliged to show your mortgage number stamped on your head. What does the member for Swan require from people who come in with a social security problem? Their bank account number? Come off it! The new era of free speech&mdash;what do you blokes want? An Australia card? I say to the member for Swan: if you are going to be serious about free speech and community consultations, let the people walk in the door without needing their mortgage number stamped on their head.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do appreciate the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) giving me notice on this occasion that he was speaking on this matter. Mr Smith, in his own words, is a craven apologist for a government that took no action on noise abatement around airports. In fact, Mr Smith, as the member for Perth, does not understand his brief about airport noise. It is something that he is very astray on. If he understood ANEF contours and the footprints of noise around airports, he would understand that he is misleading the people of his electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am interested in speaking to the people of Queens Road, South Guildford, because, if anybody around Perth airport is to be affected by the airport, they will be those most affected. If you look at the contours, you will see that there are a handful of houses that may be eligible for some noise treatment. I wanted to speak only to the people in Queens Road, South Guildford, because it is those people whom this most affects. In order to inform these people, I asked Mr Graham Muir, CEO of the FAC and general manager of Perth airport, and Mr John McAleer&mdash;who is also the expert in this area&mdash;from Airservices Australia to address the concerned people in Queens Road, South Guildford.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that I had been informed about some of the previous public meetings of the member Perth and the way they were stacked by troublesome people&mdash;in fact, it was referred to me that people left Mr Smith's public meetings crying&mdash;I wanted an orderly meeting where people would be informed. I invited the people who were best in place to inform them. I invited them to my office in a cordial atmosphere to get the facts&mdash;not the hype or the rhetoric that the member for Perth has been pouring into these people to upset them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Perth referred to a Ms Houston who said that she got nothing out of the meeting. Can I inform this House that, after Ms Houston had been informed of the facts in the meeting, I said to her, `One day, Ms Houston, if we can eventually look at this regime, you are the closest people to get some sort of compensation from this. You'll be the first in my opinion.' She said, `I don't want any insulation treatment. I want to sell my place.' That is the bottom line. She was not really there to be informed; she wanted to sell the place for the best possible price. In my opinion, Ms Houston was not there in the first place to be informed; she was there to be one of Mr Smith's apparatchiks in the local area and to stir up the meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Perth has no credibility on this issue because he does not understand his brief. He also does not have any appreciation for the people in the area. It was the member for Perth who, through his local Labor Party, asked the AEC to get that part of the electorate out of his electorate. He did not want the people of South Guildford in his electorate because it is a troublesome part of the electorate. It is affected by noise from the Perth airport. He tried to handball them over to me. I have got these people and I am going to help look after them and not give them hollow and shallow promises, as the member for Perth has done for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of South Guildford need far better representation than they have had on this. The member for Perth says there were promises about noise treatments to properties around the Perth airport. No-one promised it as far as I am concerned. The former transport minister did nothing about it. There was no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6209"> money provided&mdash;whether you want to say the next budget was coming or not. It was such an important issue, like it was around the Sydney airport, that the Labor Party should have done something about it during its 13 years in office. But all they gave was warm, fuzzy promises and no absolute and actual help for these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people should feel cheated by a member who did not even try to help them out of their problems. The first stage in trying to help those people was to bring them into my office and inform them of the actual facts as to why they are not in the same regime as that around the Sydney airport. The Sydney airport is a completely different scenario from what Mr Smith is talking about around the Perth airport. When he finally understands his brief, he can have some credibility on this issue. But at the moment he must hang his head in shame.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon in the chamber the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), in answer to a question from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), made it clear that he does not intend to take any action at a national level regarding the future of the iron and steel industry in Australia. In a subsequent conversation that I had with him, he made his views known to me that he sees it simply as a Newcastle problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, he told me that he had set up a consultative committee of parliamentarians to travel to Newcastle and have a look at the issue. Such a committee was announced some weeks ago by Senator Tierney. The only problem was that it consisted only of Liberal Party members, most of whom were in the area anyhow. The idea of sending Senator Tierney to Newcastle to find out what is going on could be a good idea&mdash;mind you, he is not there very often; it might be handy for him to find out what is actually happening locally&mdash;but it will be of zero use in terms of BHP Steel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening in iron and steel in Australia and in the world is of major consequence. We are seeing the biggest technology <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shift in this industry in this century. The shift to arc furnaces that direct produces iron has the potential for the first time since the 1960s to allow Australia to become an exporter of metal. Let me give the House the figures because they are absolutely critical. We export iron ore at a cost of $25 to $40 a tonne. Steel is worth $400 a tonne and more. The interim product, directly produced iron, costs $150 to $200 a tonne. In other words, for every tonne of iron ore we mine, we are getting as low as one-tenth of its value as metal. The shift in technology that is coming through now will allow us and BHP in particular to become a major exporter of metal, not locked in forever to iron ore exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP will say that they are developing at Port Hedland a plant to produce hot briquetted iron&mdash;and they are. It is a $1.2 billion investment. That plant will produce 2.5 million tonnes, but passing through the same port every year is 55 million tonnes of iron ore; in other words, the amount they are converting to metal is less than one-tenth. It is tokenistic and it is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> BHP is reducing the Australian production of steel by 20 per cent. If any other industry in the country said, `We're going to cut production by 20 per cent', it would be seen as a national issue. If the car industry said, `We'll reduce production of cars by 20 per cent,' we would be hearing a lot about that&mdash;or any other industry. BHP is saying that, because it is only in one plant, it therefore does not matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more important issue is that BHP is actually dropping exporting. They are basically saying, `We can't hack it in the world. We'll cut out exports. We'll reduce production by almost two million tonnes and, within a few years, we will be a major importer of steel.' What is happening is that we are changing our profile. We have been exporting three million to four million tonnes of steel a year for quite some years now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out there the market is tough, and we know that. But BHP is a big player, not some little tin-pot company. Who falls by the wayside in tough competition because of price cuts from other countries? One of the world's biggest companies. BHP is so big that it cannot stay <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6210"> in the game; yet it is also one of the world's biggest exporters of iron ore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is more about protecting their iron ore exports than about steel production. The fact is that, by dropping out of exports, BHP drops out of the game. It means their best technology goes offshore into Asia and America; it means their best steel scientists will live in other countries. We will be using the old technology of Kembla, technology which is now getting well and truly beyond its use-by date. Unless BHP are competing in world markets on a regular basis, they will fall behind the game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue did not come up overnight. It has been developing for years. It is the old story of our companies starting to reinvest. The BHP crisis in 1982&hyphen;83 was the result of a failure to invest in the 1970s. What we are seeing now is a failure by BHP to commit investment into the next century. It is a major issue of major importance. Of course, it is critical to Newcastle as well, but Newcastle, in the end, is a minor player&mdash;this is a much bigger exercise. I am disappointed that the minister does not see it that way. The fact is that we on this side of the House see steel as a major national industry.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Singaporean Army is presently conducting manoeuvres with the Australian Army at Shoalwater Bay in my electorate of Capricornia. Some 4,500 Singaporean troops are taking R and R in and around the electorate before heading home to their own country. The Singaporean Army presence injects about $20 million into the local economy and is a big boost for business, which has been going through a very rough period due to the severe drought which has had a disastrous impact on all Capricornians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a number of nasty incidents have occurred in the past weeks, which disturbs me and a considerable number of my constituents. On Saturday night a couple of Singaporean soldiers were attacked and assaulted and robbed of their money. There have been other incidents of racial abuse, spitting and assault. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> While I denounce any form of racial or physical abuse on innocent people, I find it hard to accept one of our community leader's reported comments in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> and on ABC radio that the attacks have been prompted by the speech of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you listened to all the media hype you would think that the member for Oxley has been responsible for everything that is currently happening in this country, except for the poor performance of our cricket team and the Sydney Swans losing the AFL grand final. The member for Oxley did not tell those people to go out and attack the Singaporeans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have nothing but praise for the Singaporean Army and its personnel. They have always behaved impeccably while in my electorate and are a credit to their country. I have visited the Singaporean Army Base at Rockhampton and have met with their leaders and many of the Singaporean troops; and I have found them to be most courteous and very well disciplined&mdash;and they have a very high respect for the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe the recent attacks on the Singaporean soldiers have anything to do with the member for Oxley's speech. It is just the result of putting thousands of foreign soldiers in one area&mdash;and out on the town&mdash;all at once. The law of averages says that incidents are going to happen. If we put 4,000 Aussie troops in a New Zealand town, for instance, there may be similar problems that would not normally exist. Yet we have a strong bond between the two nations, just as we have with Singapore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many ex&hyphen;servicemen out there who fought alongside the Singaporeans during the Second World War. They are our allies and our friends, and are highly respected by the people of Australia but, due to racial comments in the media that we see on a daily basis at the moment, these incidents have all been blown totally out of proportion with reality. I am disgusted with those individuals responsible for the assault on our Singaporean guests. I hope and pray the police catch the culprits and throw the book at them. Their actions I condemn; they are unacceptable and un&hyphen;Australian. But we cannot lay the blame <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6211"> for these incidents that have happened in Capricornia on the member for Oxley.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to talk in this adjournment debate about the work of the Blacktown Chamber of Commerce and Industry Workplace Learning Committee. This committee was set up in 1994 to support a number of vocational training courses in several schools in western Sydney. These courses include TRAC automotive and content endorsed courses in retail. The committee consists of representatives from the Labour Council of New South Wales, the Blacktown Chamber of Commerce and Industry, DEETYA, TAFE, state and Catholic school systems, as well as community and industry representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These vocational programs form part of the curriculum for years 11 and 12, and allow students to complete their higher school certificate and, at the same time, get hands&hyphen;on experience in industry and commerce. In years 11 and 12 it is necessary to move away from the relatively unstructured subject courses that apply in earlier years to structured student training and pathways. Schools then have the opportunity to develop these structured programs that are then linked to particular industries. These programs require substantial learning and assessment to occur at the workplace, for which students receive school accreditation and industry recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's role has been to ensure that industry understands and implements the principles of workplace training as distinct from work experience, and that students understand the relevance and requirements of vocational courses. During the two years that the workplace committee has been functioning, these programs have seen a building of bridges between the classroom and the workplace and have resulted in the young people involved being better prepared for the world of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has liaised closely with industry to ensure quality of training. Strong links have been developed between the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and local schools. Two successful award nights have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been organised and were attended by the then Minister for Vocational Education and Training in 1994 and the Director&hyphen;General of New South Wales TAFE in 1995. The attendance of such senior people in the field of vocational education has delighted the students and given the committee the encouragement to continue its work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the two&hyphen;year period that the workplace committee has been operating, vocational education has grown considerably in the schools concerned. Excellent links have been developed with the business community and a database has been developed to further assist student placements for work based training. Funding was obtained from the ASTF and teacher&hyphen;in&hyphen;business programs to employ a teacher for a five&hyphen;month period to develop stronger links with the workplace. This program also provided training to those workplaces on the procedures and requirements for certification of vocational courses, and liaison with schools and industry to broaden and strengthen the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, there are 90 students doing vocational courses in building and construction, retail, furnishing and hospitality. The program for 1997 is to further increase the number of students in vocational placements and to provide a service to other schools in the area that will be able to benefit from the experience gained by the workplace committee over its two years in operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee will offer six separate vocational courses in 1997&mdash;TRAC auto, CEC retail, CEC furnishing, CEC hospitality and catering, office administration and building and construction. Deidre Matthews, a teacher from Loyola College at Mount Druitt, and Bob Dunn, a teacher previously from Seven Hills High and now Colyton High, have been the driving force behind the formation of this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate them both and the committee in general for the work they are doing in getting students in western Sydney ready for employment and wish the committee well for the future. I am pleased to have been a formation committee member of this group and will watch its progress with interest.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to congratulate members of the Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club on their club's 50th jubilee anniversary, which occurred on 13 October last. Since the first club patrol on 9 March 1947, Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club members have freely given of their time, amounting to thousands of hours annually to serve and protect the local community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sutherland shire is renowned for its beaches, and our bronzed Aussie lifesavers are renowned for their selfless dedication. Wanda beach surf lifesavers are among the best of the best. Wanda's tradition, with its motto `Vigilance and service', has made our summers safe for those of us who love the beach and assisted countless others who get into difficulties in the water. The friendly and helpful nature of all club members, both in and out of the water, is certainly a trait that the club can be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club's dedicated members have recorded many achievements. In 1981, Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club achieved a competition clean sweep never achieved before or since. Club members won the carnival point scores in the Sydney branch, metropolitan, New South Wales state and the Australian championships, which were held at Wanda beach that year. Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club members have carried out a total of 3,772 rescues and gained a total of 3,892 lifesaving awards, gaining 191 of these awards last season&mdash;the highest of any club in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The name `Wanda' is believed to be a local Aboriginal word meaning rolling white sand hills, which is exactly what the terrain was like at the club's founding in 1946. The club, which was founded by ex-servicemen during World War II, adopted the ribbon colours of the 1939-45 star&mdash;army red, air force blue and navy blue&mdash;as their competition colours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club celebrated this special occasion with a luncheon held on 26 October 1996 at the Cronulla&hyphen;Sutherland Leagues Club. I would like to congratulate the club president, Trevor Elliott, the organisers of the 50th anniversary celebrations, including Aub Vial, the convener of the 50th year <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> celebrations committee, and all club members who have worked tirelessly preparing the celebrations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To commemorate the event, a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A club called Wanda</EMPHASIS>, written by Brad Forrest, has been published.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government recognises in its policy documents that Australia's school teachers are facing greater challenges than ever before. The information revolution, which is taking place worldwide, has the potential to leave us behind unless our teachers are themselves not only well trained but also kept abreast of the changing technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our election document on education quite rightly spelt that out: `It is our teachers who hold the key to shaping the future of our children.' We also applaud teachers for working to raise both their own standards and, subsequently, their status. In line with this, we made a strong commitment to `the provision of well&hyphen;qualified teachers through high quality pre-service training'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also acknowledged that the teachers' supply and demand cycle is turning. The surplus of the past decade is coming to an end. In fact, we are in danger of facing a severe shortage of trained teachers within a very few short years. Already in New South Wales, in the most sought after locations, casual teachers are not available. Schools are making 30 to 40 phone calls to find a relief teacher when someone is ill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does this mean that we will go back to the days when this country needed to bring in overseas trained teachers by the plane load? Most certainly not! Yet one necessary function of the government's planning for a better nation is being interpreted in such a way that it would undercut the very essence of our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6213"> strong policies for the education of our future Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the proposals by the University of New South Wales to shut down its School of Teacher Education. This school is located on the St George campus of the university at Oatley, on the doorstep of my electorate of Hughes, and is attended by many of my constituents. It is of particular interest to me, as a former mature age student, that mature women students from my electorate attend the St George campus in their pursuit of professional teaching qualifications. This allows them career opportunities which would fit in with their commitments to their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This campus is the only university campus in the southern Sydney metropolitan region. Should it be closed down, the students, particularly the mature age women students, may find themselves in circumstances which will prevent them from continuing their educational pursuits. It is true that our universities are facing budget cuts in line with many other areas, but to use those cuts as a pretext for closing one of  this country's leading schools of primary teacher education is vandalism at its worst.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This excellent purpose built facility and its funded student places were entrusted to the University of New South Wales in 1990. Now it proposes to close down its total primary teaching program, put off the staff and use the funded places to avoid cuts on its main campus. The university would then like to go further and sell off or lease out the campus itself; thus it will also deprive the entire southern Sydney region of its only university facility. This is nothing less than an asset strip of the St George campus and one of the worst breaches of public trust that I can ever recall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, it will be the teacher training facility&mdash;the one place teaching the people who are at the very foundation of all learning&mdash;which will bear the brunt of the university's budget cuts. The St George campus attracts some of the highest TER entrants of any teaching school anywhere. It also attracts them in growing numbers at a time when universities elsewhere are seeing their numbers fall. It is a campus which has led the way in programs, including its advanced level entry, which has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> attracted record numbers of applicants for 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">St George also has a tremendous reputation for the work it does with mature age students and working teachers who use its computer resources and library facilities to keep abreast or even ahead of today's needs. I believe it is preposterous, given our commitments and given the teacher shortage we may face in a few short years, that any university could even think of closing down such an important and well-accredited facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on those responsible to see to it that the St George campus, the only university campus serving the entire Sydney southern region, not be closed and that its primary teacher education program and its other initiatives in teaching be given the support and the encouragement they so rightly deserve.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The CFM Sale Bill 1996 proposes to allow the Commonwealth to dispose of its interest in Commonwealth Funds Management and its subsidiaries to the private sector. CFM currently oversees such schemes as the public sector superannuation scheme and the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. CFM's monopoly over these two schemes lapsed on 30 June last year; hence, the trustees of the CSS and the PSS are free to place funds with Commonwealth Funds Management or with funds management organisations elsewhere. Since that time, the fund trustees have been free to use investment managers other than CFM, and have done so. However, it is reported that the Commonwealth record in funds management continues to lag behind best performance in the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the cabinet decision to gauge the extent of commercial interest in the sale of CFM, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) announced the appointment of business and legal advisers to facilitate the sale. Both advisers, it was announced, would work in conjunction with the CFM sales team, the Department of Finance and CFM management on the scoping study, after which an appropriate method of sale would be decided. The government has stated that there has been strong interest in CFM as a result of the scoping study, and there has been some media speculation of a value of up to $130 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CFM has a subsidiary company, Total Risk Management, which provides strategic advice in the areas of asset allocation, portfolio restructuring, management selection and client reporting to the trustees of the CSS and the PSS. It is expected that Total Risk Management will also be sold when the CFM is sold. However, this remains to be determined by the commercial intentions of the winning bidder. Much of this bill focuses on the technicalities of privatisation, including exemptions from state or territory taxes on asset transfers and liabilities from CFM or its subsidiaries, and the cessation of certain rights, such as mobility rights under the Public Service Act 1922, when CFM is disposed of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CFM Sale Bill also raises interesting philosophical questions about privatisation. While this may be seen as a minor matter in comparison with a large national issue such as Telstra, these philosophical issues should be raised quite legitimately in debate. Unlike the approach of those opposite, Labor's approach to privatisation is not ideologically driven, in the narrow sense, by a need to own for ownership's sake or by the need to sell for the private sector's sake. We take a much more constructive view on ownership issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the active role of the public sector as an equalising and civilising force in our society. We examine the merits of public versus private ownership of utilities on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis. We are driven by the forces of good, rational policy making, not those of a blind obsession with ownership. Our desire to deliver good public policy gives Labor choice. We support the growth potential of the private sector and the power of market forces in some instances, but in other cases we believe the best outcome is delivered by the public sector.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6215">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This leads me to what I have previously described as the `six key tests' governing privatisation; tests to which the ALP subscribes. Firstly, is the market already competitive? Secondly, can private capital play the role held by public capital? Thirdly, is it necessary for the taxpayer to contribute to the capitalisation of the public enterprise? Fourthly, are the market structure, its technology and public interest considerations such that public capital can be withdrawn? Fifthly, is the good essentially non&hyphen;universal, without significant benefits and spin&hyphen;offs for the community? Sixthly, is the market without substantial externalities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) is writing down the six tests on privatisation that Labor applies; and well he might, because his side of politics does not have that level of rigour or assessment for deciding these issues. I believe that the Liberal Party is really in need of a philosophical approach to privatisation. It has what I would term a narrow ideological approach; that is to say, by its narrow definition, all public ownership of utilities is bad and all private ownership is good. Of course, in the broader sense of making good public policy, that is clearly inadequate. That narrow obsession with ownership as a test for privatisation is defying the national interest on a big public utility such as Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just run through, for the benefit of the member for North Sydney and others in the Main Committee, a comparison on the six tests&mdash;the six criteria&mdash;that Labor uses in its comparison of Telstra, and our opposition to its privatisation, and CFM, the subject of this bill, and our support. The first test is: is the market already competitive? With regard to Telstra, of course, the answer is no. Telstra is the large public utility that dominates that market; some 80 to 90 per cent of the market comprises just one company. So there is not a fully competitive market. With regard to CFM, and whether the market is already competitive, I am led to believe that there are some 37 fund management organisations in Australia, so that is a large competitive market. There is no dominant player with some 80 to 90 per cent of market share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second test is: can private capital play the role held by public capital? In the case of Telstra, our assessment is no and, in the case of CFM, our answer is yes. I think that has been understood on both sides of the parliament. The third test is: is it necessary for the taxpayer to contribute to the capitalisation of the public enterprise? In the case of Telstra, the answer is no. Telstra returns a large surplus, which I believe both sides of politics are pleased to see returned to the community in the form of cross&hyphen;subsidies. That has been the past pattern of public ownership with Telstra. Private ownership, of course, raises the question of how sustainable those cross&hyphen;subsidies would be. In the case of CFM, and whether it is necessary for the taxpayer to contribute to the capitalisation of a public enterprise, I understand from the terms of this legislation that the answer is yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth test is: is the market structure, its technology and public interest consideration such that public capital can be withdrawn? In the case of Telstra, the answer is no. The Labor Party believes, passionately, that the infrastructure for the so&hyphen;called information superhighway should remain in public hands. That is one of the core responsibilities of the public sector in the modern time. In the case of CFM, the market structure, technology and public interest do not necessarily have a consideration such that it needs to remain in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth test is: is the good essentially non&hyphen;universal, without significant benefits and spin&hyphen;offs for the community? In the case of Telstra, the answer is no. The good that we are talking about, the service of telecommunications and telephony in Australia, is of course universal, and it has significant benefits and spin&hyphen;offs across the community. In the case of CFM, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6216"> good is non&hyphen;universal. Again, we get a totally different answer out of the tests applied on privatisation by the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By now, the member for North Sydney has probably jotted down all of the tests, one to five. The sixth test is: is the market without substantial externalities? In the case of Telstra, the answer is no. The substantial externality lies in industry policy, the great purchasing power of Telstra to support the growth and development of telecommunications in Australia. In the case of CFM, it is very hard to identify substantial externalities, particularly in a national sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So those are the six questions. In the case of CFM, the answer is one to six in the affirmative. In the case of Telstra, the answer is one to six in the negative. We get totally different circumstances and totally different outcomes once a proper, well thought out philosophical approach to privatisation is applied, instead of following a narrow ownership test and ownership alone. That is the substantial difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate and the criteria that I have outlined to the Main Committee highlight a stark contrast within this parliament: the Australian Labor Party has a pragmatic, well thought out philosophical approach to privatisation which we strongly believe matches up to the public interest; the Liberal Party is narrow, obsessive and ownership focused, without any broader approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the member for North Sydney, who is the next speaker, is pioneering new philosophies within the Liberal Party under the name of John Stuart Mill. I welcome that approach. You will learn much more from Mill than Lyons. We know that on the Labor side because he ratted on us. He had nothing to offer, he went over to the other side and offered even less. There is no doubt that, as the Liberal Party works out these philosophical questions in the 1990s&mdash;Mill versus Lyons&mdash;they will learn a lot more from Mill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that sense, I take inspiration from the member for North Sydney and I think he has something to offer his side of politics in sticking to the philosophy of John Stuart Mill. I think an objective observer&mdash;and in these matters I am trying so hard to be objective&mdash;would see that level of debate as a great advance for the Liberal Party on their past ideological struggles. How tawdry they were&mdash;Howard versus Peacock, wet versus dry, left versus right&mdash;throughout the 1980s. At least in the 1990s they have progressed to the point where it is John Stuart Mill versus Joe Lyons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need for all parliamentarians&mdash;party matters aside&mdash;to address these key philosophical questions and public interest considerations that arise out of privatisation. We need more parliamentarians to debate these matters. I recall some years ago one of my predecessors in Werriwa, Gough Whitlam&mdash;a great inspiration for me, as for many other Labor people&mdash;asking the question: `Comrade, where are all the lawyers?' He was talking about our side of politics. Looking at the Liberal Party benches as one considers the issue of a philosophical approach to privatisation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for North Sydney points out they have got plenty of lawyers. That is right&mdash;you have too many lawyers. The question on the Liberal Party side is: where are all the economists? Where are all the economists who are making a contribution to policy and thinking as we grapple with some of the key economic issues, including privatisation, in the post&hyphen;industrial society? I think the member for North Sydney has some background and expertise in this area. He has made some quite enlightened speeches, consistent with John <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6217"> Stuart Mill, consistent with small `l' liberalism&mdash;which is a welcome trend on his side of the House.

I suppose in opposition you look at these things and not only do you think about your own side but you also have time to think about the others. We think about them and we hope good things come out of the John Stuart Mill Society for the national interest. The most important thing&mdash;and it is directly relevant to the CFM sale&mdash;is that they flesh out a full philosophical, public interest approach to privatisation, not a narrow ideological obsession with ownership and ownership alone. So the hopes of the Liberal Party rest on the broad shoulders of the member for North Sydney, and to some extent&mdash;as long as they remain in government&mdash;the hopes of the nation. Maybe that is the kiss of death; maybe it can also be regarded as kind, generous words of encouragement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be noted that the government's approach to privatisation is nowhere near as reasoned as Labor's. During the Telstra debate, government members argued obsessively that the ALP is bound to support the sale of Telstra because we initiated the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. The difference between those utilities and the case of Telstra is clear on each of the six criteria and tests that I have outlined for privatisation. I believe it is a credit to the Australian Labor Party that it has the maturity and capability for debate on these matters and that the outcomes at which we arrive are the product of policy making rigour and, above all, the best interests of our constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coalition members in this place and beyond would arrive at the same conclusions on Telstra if they were to apply a privatisation test that makes most sense. Above all, they would vote for the best interests of their constituencies, for the maintenance of cross&hyphen;subsidies that provide hundreds of millions of dollars per annum to their electorates. They would vote for public information technology which would make itself accessible to regional Australia. But, as we have seen in this place time and time again, the National Party, in particular, have conducted a clearance sale on their philosophy. They stand for very little, let alone a coherent position on the privatisation of public assets&mdash;and I am saddened to say that with you in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. But in your other life, as a National Party member when you are not in the chair, I am saddened that it has come to this. By contrast, Labor's criteria for privatisation reflects our understanding of the differences between privatisation and competition; two very different economic concepts, both in their theory and their practice. Unlike those opposite, Labor is capable of distinguishing privatisation from competition because the two concepts are capable of producing vastly different outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor applies the following principles to competition policies&mdash;they are our four fundamentals for the public sector&mdash;and, again, the member for North Sydney sharpens his pencil in expectation. First, adopting a sector&hyphen;by&hyphen;sector, case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case framework by which the different imperatives and outcomes of competition policy can be judged. Unlike the coalition, we are not locked into the dogma of competition at any cost. We believe passionately in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6218"> active role of the public sector as an equalising and liberating force in our society&mdash;something that even members of the John Stuart Mill Society could support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, rejecting competition policy as an end in itself. It is critical in this policy area to separate means, the ideology of competition markets, from ends, enhanced competitiveness. In cases where the impact on competition is marginal, Labor opposes competition policies which have a net impact of withdrawing public resources, jobs and services from rural and regional economies. Labor is fundamentally committed to the role of the public sector in funding the cost of distance in Australia. As we talk about the role and size of the public sector, there could be no more relevant public discourse than to consider that in a big country like ours there is a genuine role for government in funding the cost of distance, the cost of funding services and utilities across a large continent; utilities being infrastructure, of course.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HOCKEY" NAMEID="DK6">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Private tollways.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You like tollways and you advised the member for Macarthur in your former capacity to that effect, but tollways and infrastructure have a great equity function, and the equity function is, first and foremost, not to levy the tolls on those who cannot afford to pay. That was the policy of the Greiner and Fahey governments. Freeways on Gore Hill in your electorate, but tollways and user&hyphen;pays on road facilities in my electorate. That is a stunning double standard that reverses concepts of equity. Why should the richest part of Sydney get a freeway and one of the poorer parts of Sydney get a tollway? So Labor has not only the philosophy but also the compassion that judges these issues with regard to equity. The equity consideration in a big country like ours is equality of opportunity and equality of access. To fund the cost of distance, it is not possible in a nation like ours to have services and facilities provided universally around the nation unless government is playing that role. That is one of the very strong arguments why Telstra should remain in public ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I continue, having disposed of the protests of the member for North Sydney on infrastructure matters. In cases where the impact on competitiveness is marginal, Labor opposes competition policies which have a net impact of withdrawing public resources, jobs and services from rural and regional economies. We do not believe there is a replacement effect whereby the private sector automatically takes over the functions and spending power of the public sector. With the corrosive impact of globalisation on social capital and civil society, there is in fact more work for the public sector to undertake as an expression of collective interest and collective action, not less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third principle is ensuring that competition policy does not result in de facto privatisation. It should not be a device by which the public sector is left to wither on the vine. That has so unhappily been the pattern of policy making in states like Victoria, where competition policy is used as an alibi for privatisation. It is used as a way of running down the size and capacity of the public sector and then, in the budget formulation, saying that there is no choice but to dispose of these assets for the sake of a short&hyphen;term bottom line benefit. Competition policy should be on a truly level playing field with public sector competitors given the same access to capital and markets as the private sector. Labor is in the business of fully resourcing the core functions of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, and finally, ensuring the use of public benefit tests by the federal and state governments gives full weight to legitimate welfare equity, environmental and regional development issues, as initiated under the former Labor government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6219">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just wrap up my remarks by applying these tests on privatisation and competition policy to the principles underpinning this bill, the CFM Sale Bill. According to its recently tabled annual report on 30 June this year, CFM had $8.8 billion under management, including $1.8 billion managed by other fund managers under the TRM arrangements. In the last financial year, CFM obtained $379 million of new funds under its management. In 1995&hyphen;96 CFM made a profit of some $2.6 million and paid a dividend to the Commonwealth of $1.6 million. CFM is a profitable organisation and it is paying a dividend to the shareholder. That said, the opposition does not see a core need for the public sector to operate in the funds management advice area, and accordingly we will not be opposing this legislation. This decision is consistent with the trend in the last decade for the public sector to withdraw from operating businesses in financial markets, be they banks, insurance companies or funds management bodies. Again, those decisions of withdrawal, particularly in the case of the Commonwealth Bank, are consistent with the tests and criteria I outlined earlier to the Main Committee on privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As previously stated, CFM has not enjoyed a monopoly right to manage the funds of Commonwealth superannuation since July 1995. The introduction of competition works both ways, and this is a very important point for members to acknowledge. CFM not only manages funds for Commonwealth superannuation funds but is also free to compete for the business of other public and private sector funds. It has been reasonably successful in pursuing new clients outside its traditional market. By 1995&hyphen;96, the retail side of CFM's operations has grown to more than $300 million of funds under management. That, essentially, reflects a truly level playing field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to apply the principles of competitive neutrality, they need to be a two&hyphen;way street so that private sector organisations can compete against the public sector. We should not be shackling or in any way restricting the capacity of the public sector to, in turn, compete against the private sector, to defend its market share and even expand its market share if the private sector is not competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a principle of competitive neutrality that the Howard government, quite shamefully, are watering down because they do not believe that competitive neutrality is a two&hyphen;way street. They see it as a one&hyphen;way street, all for the benefit of the private sector competing against the public sector. I urge this government, in their competitive neutrality statements, as I do tory governments in the states, to reassess the criteria and guarantee to the taxpayer, and the public, that competitive neutrality is a two&hyphen;way street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public sector employees should not be shackled in their capacity to compete against the private sector. Yet, if one examines the Kennett government policies on, say, pathology, one can see that they have been shackled. I have had questions on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> about the government's policies on administrative services. The member for North Sydney should read and analyse them, and even take them to the John Stuart Mill Society and put up a debate about competitive neutrality.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Risk capital, competition neutrality, privatisation. The member should take those issues forward, give them proper scrutiny and argue the very strong case that competitive neutrality should be a two&hyphen;way street, not a one&hyphen;way street. With a two&hyphen;way street, the public sector can compete vigorously with assets, with resourcing, and with capability, without any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6220"> restrictions at law against the private sector, particularly in those instances where the private sector is anti&hyphen;competitive and engaging in restrictive practices against the public interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have mentioned, CFM is a profitable organisation. We regard the decision and the bill as consistent with the trend in the last decade with regard to financial markets. The introduction of competition should work both ways and that is a key principle by which the Labor Party addresses these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite an improvement in performance since the creation of CFM out of the former superannuation fund investment structure, the Commonwealth's record in funds management has generally lagged behind the best private sector performers. However, it should be noted that CFM is considered a very good performer in the area of fixed interest. Some of CFM's recent performance ratings provide an indication of the cost and effort which would involve the Commonwealth maintaining its stake in Commonwealth superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latest Intech superannuation performance survey ranked CFM at number 32 out of 37 super funds in the 12 months to March 1996. CFM managed growth fund return currently rates seven per cent lower than the ANZ's ranking. Any attempt by the government to revitalise CFM would involve an injection of funds into the company. It is the view of CFM managing director&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a problem with that. In the third test I put forward to the committee, the taxpayer should not, in cases such as this, be expected to fund the revitalisation of CFM if there is a better use within other markets for that scarce public resource, the scarce injection of risk capital. For the member for North Sydney to be singing the virtues of public sector risk capital I would have thought is contrary to all the rhetoric on his side of politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party believes there is a role for public sector risk capital but it has got to be carefully targeted to anti&hyphen;competitive markets where there is no alternative, where the public sector will not play a role in terms of risk capital. To whatever extent, say, Telstra takes a risk in the market that is not a risk that is being shared across the entire economy, then Telstra, as the dominant player, bears most of the responsibility for any market risk. There is a legitimate role for the public sector in that capacity. Any allocation of public resources bears some risk. It might not be capital risk, but there is always management risk in public sector allocations, on and off budget. So that needs to be understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the board of the CFM has been consulted on these matters and concurs with the proposal to privatise. At a time when vital social services are being savagely reduced by this government, the opposition is of the view that priority in public outlays should not include a capital injection to CFM. Accordingly, this legislation is not opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do flag, however, Labor's position relating to the sale of CFM and the administration of ComSuper. I believe the government is examining the possibility of rolling from CFM privatisation into privatisation of ComSuper administration. That is something which the opposition has severe reservations about. Such an action could be inconsistent with our criteria and tests for determining privatisation. Now is not the time and place to run ComSuper administration through those tests and criteria but I know that my colleague, the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), who will be speaking on this bill, has strong views on the matter. He and the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) are powerful advocates within the ACT on employment considerations relating to the administration of ComSuper and he is better placed than I to explain the detail and public interest considerations to the committee. I conclude at <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6221"> that point. I commend a philosophical approach to privatisation issues. I look forward to the comments of the member for North Sydney, but restate that the opposition as such will not be opposing the CFM sale legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

I do not remember us having a terribly competitive aviation market when the Australian Labor Party chose, when it was in government, to sell Qantas. In fact, it went to the Australian people saying, `Well, we're only going to sell a small part, given that there is not a terribly competitive market.' Indeed, it went ahead and sold the total shareholding of the Commonwealth government in Qantas and no&hyphen;one could argue for one second that there was a terribly competitive market in domestic aviation at the time. That is the first contradiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second contradiction is private versus public capital; should we have public capital invested in GBEs&mdash;specifically in relation to Telstra&mdash;or should we be replacing it with private capital? If I remember correctly, one of the key arguments about the initial sale of Qantas was the fact that it did need capital. There were good reasons at the time perhaps and many people in the member for Werriwa's party argued that the ALP should retain all of the shareholding in Qantas. But no, they chose to go outside of the regular markets and, instead of debt financing, they chose to raise capital through a partial sale of Qantas. There is the second contradiction and I am only up to the second criterion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third criterion was whether the taxpayer should contribute to the overall capital of the enterprise. What the member for Werriwa was saying was that whenever one of these GBEs needs some capital, we should sell. That seems to contradict the second principle. But if an enterprise is in need of capital, either it is not being profitable&mdash;it is a diminishing asset and it is time to sell&mdash;or it needs capital and you are trying to bolster up the share value of the asset. There seem to be contradictions, again, in the ALP's policy on that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth issue is in market structure. Is the market sufficiently competitive, and I think that is what the member for Werriwa was getting at&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is it?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DK6">Mr HOCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal Party's criteria are not dissimilar to some of the more coherent criteria espoused by the member for Werriwa, but they are dissimilar as to the question of degree. The first question is: is there a public interest in owning the asset? In a world that is changing quite rapidly, certainly in terms of financial markets and most definitely in terms of communications, the markets are changing faster than the ownership criteria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As such, we find that, for example, Telstra is a global player in the communications market, not necessarily just a domestic player. Therefore, if you assess the market that it is operating in as simply a domestic market, you are making a gross mistake about some of the effects of the sale on that market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second question is: is there a competitive market? We believe that where there is evidence of a competitive market the asset should be sold. In some areas that is not the case. It certainly varies from area to area. For example, in Victoria there is a competitive market in the area of electricity. In New South Wales, the electricity generators have been put into a competitive market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over time I would place a lottery ticket on the fact that the Carr government will be selling some generators. That is because they now have a competitive market for the supply of electricity and, with the development of the national grid, that will go even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third question is: can the private sector do the job? The private sector has matured significantly since the days when Sir Robert Menzies chose to sell the Commonwealth's part stake in General Motors Holden. The market has developed because the Australian economy, even though it was born out of public sector enterprises, has developed as an internationally competitive economy, a significant part of which is based on the development and the contributions of the private sector.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6223">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, in certain areas there is a very strong private sector level of activity. They are the three main criteria. Of course, one of the most significant criteria that the coalition government takes into account is what is in the best interests of the shareholder and what is in the best interests of the GBE that we are choosing to sell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to Commonwealth Funds Management. As the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) said in the second reading speech, CFM provides investment services in the public and private sectors. Its major clients are the board of trustees of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme and the public sector superannuation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CFM is a wholesale funds manager for a number of other public and private sector funds. It is involved in retail funds management for individual investors via its superannuation and general investment products. Its sale reflects the fact that governments around the world are selling out of companies that are involved in financial services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have had, throughout Australia, a rapid change in relation to bank ownership, and that has been the catalyst for the domino effect of more recent times in the change of ownership of various financial institutions around the country. That has extended to insurance, such that GIO, SGIC, SIO and perhaps some of the other state&hyphen;owned organisations that deal in insurance are being sold&mdash;all except, of course, those of the Queensland government, which is choosing to invest. The state government in New South Wales&mdash;the Labor colleagues of the federal opposition&mdash;are in fact selling Axiom, which is the old state super fund, and it is to be sold within five years. However, in the case of Axiom, they are providing a five&hyphen;year fixed contract, I understand, which guarantees that the new purchasers will have access to the current level of funds under management for at least five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should the Commonwealth sell its stake in CFM? The first principle is that the private sector can do the job. There are $320 billion in managed funds in Australia, of which $245 billion is in superannuation. Contrary to the comments by the member for Werriwa, there are actually more than 37 firms managing superannuation. I believe there are at least 62. The most significant firms are some of the more established names that the Australian people are familiar with: AMP, Bankers Trust, Lend Lease, National Mutual and the Queensland Investment Corporation. There is a very strong degree of competition at this level, and Commonwealth Funds Management&mdash;in the table provided by the Australian Investment Managers Association 1996 annual report&mdash;came in at number 15 with $6,914.9 million under management, which represented 2.11 per cent of the overall market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we have a diminishing asset. Why? Firstly, there was a legislative monopoly provided to CFM over CSS and PSS funds. However, that legislative monopoly ended on 30 June 1995. It is somewhat ironic that, before the 1993 federal election, the government at the time chose to renew the contract&mdash;perhaps with a belief that they might not be re&hyphen;elected and therefore might not have to deal with the problem. But we all have to deal with the problem, because CFM have certainly suffered because of the ending of the legislative monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since that time, CSS and PSS have put $7 billion of their funds out to tender, and CFM has lost 27 per cent of that amount: around $1.89 billion. Most of the funds lost have been in active funds. Where the funds manager has active funds, the funds manager is trying to outperform the index. This is high margin business for a funds manager, and I understand that CFM has lost $1.3 billion in active funds management in 1995&hyphen;96. The tender was on the advice of Total Risk Management, which is a subsidiary of CFM, so there was no suggestion <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6224"> at all that Total Risk Management were providing advice other than that which is in the best interests of the trustees of the funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The focus on the loss of high margin business has not precluded CFM from being involved in passive funds management, which is the core of its business. But passive funds management, because it is all about index weighted investments, is not as profitable; and the cost has come to the fore only in the last 24 hours, when CFM announced that its net profit for the 1995&hyphen;96 financial year had fallen from $7.1 million to $2.7 million. And that is despite the fact that the net assets have actually increased to $21.928 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area where the asset is diminishing is because of the competitive market. As I mentioned earlier, there is a highly competitive market in funds management and, therefore, margins are significantly tighter. There is a greater volatility in overall markets, whether it be in interest rates or equities or perhaps even real estate, than there has been over the last 20 years. Even though there are obviously ways for funds managers to hedge that risk of volatility, it does come at some degree of cost. One of the costs is that funds managers are relying increasingly on top quality research. This is not to say that CFM does not have access to that top quality research, but what it does mean is that CFM needs to be able to pool its research abilities with other major players in order to provide an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board service to its clients. Otherwise, there is an opportunity for CFM to focus on particular market areas, to become a niche player, and that provides a level of contradiction with its main source of funding, which is the funds of the Australian public servants. The bottom line is that the Commonwealth is not in the business of funds management, and I am very pleased that the opposition agrees with us on this; that it is not a core activity of the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, in this case, there is no doubt that staff will be the beneficiaries of the sale. Allan Moss, the chief executive of Macquarie Bank, was recently quoted as saying that the greatest asset of the bank walks out the door on a Friday afternoon, and it is quite true, particularly in relation to financial services, that the quality of the assets of a financial institution is essentially based on the quality of its staff. I believe that CFM do have very good quality staff. However, they have had a difficult time. Often vendors underestimate the effect on staff of a sale process. Whenever there is great uncertainty, such as the uncertainty created by the opposition and the Democrats in relation to the sale of Telstra, it does have a significant detrimental effect on staff morale, and it does have an effect on the attitude of staff to their determination to pursue a career within that organisation&mdash;perhaps not in relation to Telstra, where the government have already said there is going to be a public float, but certainly in relation to trade sales, where even the vendor does not know who the purchaser will be until contracts are signed&mdash;and staff do lose confidence in an organisation. However, according to the report of the chief executive of CFM, the staff have reacted very well to the ups and downs of the sale process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have also, of course, gone through a difficult time over recent years associated with the change in the nature of the business; that is, not just the make&hyphen;up and structure of CFM but also the fact that they have lost a significant amount of funds associated with active investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the staff will have broader career opportunities in the future under private ownership. Inevitably, in financial markets there is a certain risk associated with a job, but remuneration is very high because the workload is overwhelming, and I believe that, at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6225"> end of the day, the staff will be better remunerated under private ownership and they will certainly enjoy a more stable working environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, under part 3, protects the current entitlements of staff and also provides a special protection for existing leave entitlements. The customers will also benefit. They will have access to a new organisation that will enjoy the efficiencies of a national network. Overheads will be cheaper, which allows CFM to provide a better margin on its costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale process is all&hyphen;important. It should be smooth and avoid troubles. And it is important that, on both sides of the House, we talk up the potential of the asset, which I think all members of this House would agree is significant in its potential new environment. This bill also provides flexibility. For example, in part 2, subsidiaries such as TRM can be transferred back to the Commonwealth. It may not be appropriate for TRM to be a part of the final sale, and I readily accept that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, the most important point, of course, is what the shareholders get for the asset in terms of price. As Australian taxpayers, we have borne the risk of owning the asset over the years. It is most important that we maximise price, but balance it with some of the other issues that I have referred to. I wish the minister all the best for the sale and wish the staff of CFM a profitable and very productive future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) said that Labor supports the CFM Sale Bill 1996 and I, too, will support it. But I do have some reservations about the sale and I think it is worth expressing those as part of the debate. This is only a small issue, not a major issue, and I think it should be treated on quite practical grounds. It is not an intensely ideological issue at all. It seems to me that good policy is normally made in a context of commitment to goals, but also in a situation where one is pragmatic about means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The goals that we should be committed to are ones about the security of people. That includes opportunities for employment and adequate income. It includes maximum freedom&mdash;one wants no more government intervention than is necessary to achieve agreed goals and to achieve the common good. There is a balance, of course: how to balance the interests of the individual and the interests of the whole community. We also have to have a commitment to equity because if our society becomes very unequal then it becomes divided, and that causes division, tension and possibly serious breakdown and conflict. Everyone also wants an opportunity for a lively life, an attractive life, where there is plenty of opportunity for full human, spiritual and cultural expression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of those goals, is it possible to draw out any principles or issues that might relate to this very small and very specific issue? The honourable member for Werriwa attempted to do so and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) also followed up with some of those issues. On several of the issues that they discussed, I think it would be quite possible to take an alternative view. If, for example, you look at the public interest, the central question is: what is in the best interests of the contributors in the public sector? It could be that their interests will be best served by having this organisation privately owned. It is almost entirely a private industry. But I will come, in a minute, to some ways in which it may be beneficial to keep this small part of that industry in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same sort of point could be made in relation to contributors generally, and I will come to that now because the second issue that both previous speakers raised was about market structure. They said that this is a competitive market structure, but I am honestly not convinced <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6226"> about that. It is true that there are many organisations involved in the industry, but it is also absolutely true that there are conventions about the fees that the managers charge which enable them to have a very comfortable, relatively high income situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, I am not convinced that this industry is really and intensely competitive. Even though there are many companies involved, they all operate at very similar margins. They charge quite surprisingly high fees. Normally, I understand, they charge somewhere between 0.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent of the value of the capital asset each year. That gives them very high incomes in a situation where the only risk for them is the risk of losing the funds that they manage. It is not their money that they are managing; it is someone else's money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The risk for them is that they may lose their market share. Of course, they have to struggle to keep market share; they have to demonstrate that they are operating professionally but, as in other professions, such as the medical and legal professions, there are professional norms about fees which are very high and which deprive contributors of a significant proportion of the income that their funds receive every year, and that does not suggest that this is a really competitive situation. In that kind of structure, therefore, a reasonable case can be made, I think, for keeping a small part of it in public ownership so as to have both greater intensity of competition and possibly a window into what is happening in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I wanted to find out about what was happening in this industry five years ago, I went to a superannuation fund investment trust, the predecessor of the Commonwealth Funds Management. They were quite happy to tell me what they were doing and what others were doing. They were not breaking any commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence information but, because they were in the public sector, they were more accessible than a private company would have been. That sort of advice would also continue to be available to government if government kept this in public ownership. So, I think that a case can be made in terms of even market structure for keeping this in public ownership. It is not a very strong point. It is an on&hyphen;balance point, but I put it forward.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me return for a minute to the issue of the fees. I hope that at some point this parliament will do an inquiry into this industry. It is an enormously important industry and, in a sense, our whole economic future depends on it because of the level of funds that it has got under its control. It is now well established, and I think that it would be entirely appropriate for there to be a parliamentary inquiry at some point.</PARA>

There are many issues there that warrant study. Now would be a suitable time to do it because the industry is off and running well and truly. If it had been kept in public ownership, there would, of course, be no risk to contributors at all because the trustees still have the opportunity for moving all the funds to somebody else if they so choose. It is a bit of a red herring which one or two speakers have raised in other places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6227">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the issue of profitability, the facts as outlined by the honourable member for Werriwa were absolutely true. In recent times, particularly during the last year or two, Commonwealth Funds Management has been at the lower end of rates of return amongst investment fund managers because of the balance of its portfolio. It invested fairly heavily in property, and property has not done well in recent years. Others have other structures and they have done better when the Stock Exchange is up. As property recovers, as it certainly will, the funds under management by Commonwealth Funds Management will do better, as well. So, I do not think that that is a simple issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the important point in relation to profitability is: what is the level of return at the time contributors retire? It is impossible to know that. We have the proxy of estimating returns in the short term&mdash;three months, a year, three years, five years&mdash;and that is the best that we can do. But it is only a proxy. The ultimate test needs to be: how effectively were the funds managed at the time the contributor retired?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it had been kept in public ownership, there would have been no cost to the Commonwealth at all. I think the honourable member for Werriwa, by the way, was wrong about the need for a capital injection. I do not think there was any requirement for a capital injection at all. It is a tiny organisation, Commonwealth Funds Management, simply managing funds. It does not require capital itself. There is no risk capital involved by the Commonwealth at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point in relation to the issue of contributors is that, when an organisation has been privatised, management have always increased their own salaries. In some of the privatised industries in Britain, the management executive salaries have doubled or trebled and it has been quite disgraceful to see what has happened in Britain. I am not saying that that would automatically happen here but I bet that if this is sold, then the salaries will rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, on the issue of what might happen after the sale, there has been a suggestion that Lend Lease is one of the bidders for purchase of Commonwealth Funds Management and that it has offered two seats to the CPSU. That would be very valuable if it happened because that would ensure that contributors were directly represented in the control of the privatised Commonwealth Funds Management. I would strongly support that if it happened but there is no&mdash;</PARA>

The sale of Commonwealth Funds Management is a relatively minor issue, but the possibility of privatising the management of the Commonwealth superannuation funds would be far more important because that directly affects all the contributors. It directly affects all the employees, of whom there are two or three hundred, but they are quite a small group in relation to Commonwealth Funds Management.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with my colleagues the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) in supporting the opposition's position, which is that we are not opposed to the CFM Sale Bill. They have set out the reasons fairly comprehensively. I will briefly comment in support of their position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general, my view is that this is an unnecessary bill. It is based on the wrong motives; it has not set out any objective criteria to justify the action. The closest we got to any objective criteria were actually those set out by the member for Werriwa, and amplified by the member for Fraser. They are a portent of worrying possibilities in the future, particularly those that the member for Fraser referred to in his concluding remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my colleagues have said, this is not a major matter and the opposition is not opposing the government's intention. It is not a major matter in terms of scale. We have here a minnow amongst Australian public sector agencies, and we have a matter that is not a quintessential or core public sector function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the issues are not controversial because the interests of contributors appear certain not to be affected by the change, and the interests of taxpayers are protected provided the price achieved is appropriate. I want to comment on whether that is going to be the case in terms of the timing of this matter in a moment. Nevertheless, in general, the interests of taxpayers are not adversely affected, apart from some comments I might want to make about timing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an interesting precedent in terms of some of the matters that have led to the circumstances of this proposed sale, including some of them reflected in this legislation, of the extent to which the CPSU has been able to ensure that the interests of the affected employees of CFM are protected. This is an issue I think we will need to address more often if the program of privatisation and related contracting out in other matters persists, and it appears clear from this government's declared intention that it will. We will need to have a look at that question of the continuing rights and entitlements of employees who are working for the agency in question. There are some interesting precedents in what has happened here and it is an issue to look at in future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that the timing of this matter might lead us to a bit of a bargain basement sale. We are debating this bill on the day in which a significant adverse turn in profit performance for CFM appears in newspapers. There are a number of reasons that will explain that adverse turn and it is not something about which we should be alarmed, but it does indicate that we might not be proposing a sale at the time most likely to get the major return for the taxpayers. The profit results are low for a variety of reasons&mdash;one is to do with inherent volatility in return in this sort of industry. We are also proposing the sale at a time of major change in the activities of CFM. I do not have time to detail it and my colleagues have but, in essence, it is a product of the very proper and very important decision to break the monopoly of funds management of CFM which was made by the previous government and given effect to in the middle of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That very important decision was the key decision to protect the interest of taxpayers and contributors and, at a time of that fundamental change and uncertainty&mdash;uncertainty about the success of CFM in this new competitive environment&mdash;it does appear to me that this is a very odd time to be making this sale, even if you were ideologically committed to the sale. I think it is a combination of ideological prejudice that drives a desire to sell every Commonwealth asset and a fixation with the budget bottom line this year that leads to bargain basement sales <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6229"> even where that may not be the most effective or successful way of protecting the interests of the taxpayers as the owners of this asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to dwell too long on the arguments about poor performance because I do not have time to do it, due to other commitments in the main chamber, but I think most of the focus on the poor performance of CFM is very short term. I have not been a member of parliament as long as some but during my period here in the parliament CFM, or at least its predecessor, the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, was for at least one year the top performer amongst investment fund managers. I never felt that established that it was inherently superior to all the others, and the fact that in some subsequent years it has been otherwise does not make it inherently inferior. It is simply the different weight and balance of various funds. When property has a higher return than the stock market or cash, you find that companies like the then SFIT, Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, which had a weighting towards property, tend to be more successful. Its poor performances must be assessed in the circumstances that it only lost the exclusive mandate on 30 June last year and it is in the process of adapting to these changing circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, while I lack any enthusiasm for the inherent intellectual rigour of the argument in support of this sale, you cannot get passionate in opposition to it because it is a very minor matter and is not a core public sector function. What is more, I recognise that, at the end of the day, if the sale does not go ahead, it is open to the government merely to let CFM run down without providing the resources to fund it effectively and operate it effectively, which leads to a hiatus in effective funds management, which is not in anybody's interest, neither the taxpayers nor the contributors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has taken this initiative, as is its right as the party that won the election. The issues in it are not such that one feels disposed to go to the barricades against it. The consequences of not selling it in the circumstances of the budgetary options available to the government might be worse than selling it. So I join with my colleagues in saying&mdash;without enthusiasm, but in recognition of reality&mdash;that we will not be opposing this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In response to the debate in the Main Committee on the CFM Sale Bill 1996 I firstly thank honourable members, all of whom are supporting it. The opposition have made it very clear that they will not stand in the way of this bill proceeding to allow the government to proceed to the sale of Commonwealth Funds Management. In view of the debate that has taken place, I think it is worth repeating that the government are simply moving to sell this asset because Commonwealth Funds Management are no longer the sole manager of the public sector funds&mdash;the CSS and the PSS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the establishment of CFM in 1990, the legislative monopoly given to it in 1990, for a period of five years, has expired. As is their legitimate role, the trustees of the public sector superannuation scheme have gone to the marketplace in the interest of all members. And, in that competitive marketplace, there has been a running down of the assets being managed by CFM as the trustees have seen that they can obtain a service which is price competitive and which delivers the service to the members of those funds. So that is the first reason: the monopoly has gone and the business is diminishing as a result of the competitive market that is out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason is that CFM itself is no longer managing solely the public sector funds. It has expanded its activities outside the public sector superannuation funds. It undertakes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6230"> wholesale funds management in both the private and the public sectors. It is involved in retail funds management for a number of individual investors via its superannuation and general investment retail products. The third reason is that it is clear to the government, from the National Commission of Audit's report and recommendations, that when you examine what is legitimate business of government the Commonwealth Funds Management does not come within what has been stated as the legitimate role of business for government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of aspects which I believe make it important for this sale to proceed sooner rather than later. The one I want to stress is that there has been some considerable concern by the employees of both Commonwealth Funds Management and its subsidiary company, Total Risk Management, over some months now as they have seen the business diminish. It puts at risk their employment and they believe that being able to get some certainty back into the process is in the interests of themselves and their careers, and gives them the certainty that has been lacking. I wish to stress that I have been very conscious of that aspect of the sale and the uncertainty surrounding legislation and the competitive bidding process which is under way at this point of time. When that comes to a conclusion, sooner rather than later, I am sure that will benefit the employees&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>Despite a very high standard of living and generally adequate nutrition, significant illness and death still occur from diseases such as pertussis and measles, which can be prevented by immunisation. If enough children are immunised, outbreaks of these illnesses will be prevented. For example, in the United Kingdom, the recent measles&hyphen;rubella campaign has interrupted measles transmission in school children, and may have stopped the circulation of the virus throughout the population. In March and April 1995, only four cases of measles were confirmed: three had recently arrived from overseas. The fourth case involved an unvaccinated <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6231"> boy of 15 months. In Australia, with approximately one&hyphen;third of the population of the United Kingdom, there were 229 notifications of measles reported during the same period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Low immunisation coverage rates continue to be of concern in Australia. Continuing epidemics of vaccine preventable diseases indicate that current immunisation rates are not sufficient to prevent the transmission of these diseases.  There have been 300 cases of measles reported for the year to 17 August, 1996; 1,284 cases were reported during 1995; 4,895 cases, in 1994; and 4,536 cases, in 1993. Between 1983 and 1993 there were 41 deaths caused by measles. States and territories have been unable to adequately monitor immunisation coverage using consistent methodology, nor with a reasonable degree of precision. No state or territory is able to provide immunisation coverage estimates which can identify groups who are at risk of disease through incomplete immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1994-95 budget, an additional $24 million was allocated to implement a number of initiatives to increase immunisation coverage rates and to curb the continuing outbreak of vaccine preventable disease. This allocation included funding to trial the Australian childhood immunisation register&mdash;called `the register'&mdash;for children up to six years of age, for a period of 18 months. The register is administered by the Health Insurance Commission, and it commenced operation on 1 January 1996. This government has guaranteed funding for the register beyond this 18&hyphen;month period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is anticipated that, for the first time, the register will provide a comprehensive, effective management tool for monitoring immunisation coverage and improving service delivery. Practitioners and immunisation providers have responded with enthusiasm to the new program and, already, a significant amount of information has been recorded on the register. Indications are that the register will grow to provide a comprehensive and valuable measure of immunisation coverage in Australia. Preliminary figures indicate that, up to 31st August 1996, approximately 1.6 million immunisation episodes have been recorded on the register.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1996 will enable the Health Insurance Commission to release information from the register to prescribed bodies, for purposes relating to the immunisation or health of children. Commonwealth, state and territory health authorities and other prescribed bodies will be provided with de-identified information about immunisation coverage rates at national, state and local levels. This information will identify areas of high risk because of large numbers of unimmunised children and will therefore enable immunisation programs, including education programs, to be effectively targeted. With the consent of the parent or guardian, recognised immunisation providers will be able to establish the immunisation history of a child, before administering vaccines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents or guardians will be able to obtain a statement by post of the immunisations administered to their child from 1 January 1996, regardless of where in Australia the child was immunised. This information will, over time, assist parents or guardians in providing evidence of their child's immunisation history for enrolment in child&hyphen;care facilities or school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Information from the register forms the basis of an operational recall reminder scheme which will inform parents or guardians when their child's next vaccination is due or past due. Where a parent or guardian of a child opts out of the recall reminder scheme identifying information will not be released. However, the inclusion of these children in de&hyphen;identified reports will assist in the accurate determination of immunisation coverage rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concern was initially expressed about the compulsory nature of enrolment on the register. However, immunisation is such an important health issue and the health of the community <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6232"> is best served by comprehensive information. An individual's choice to opt out of the recall reminder scheme will not compromise the safety of others in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, extensive consultation has taken place with the Privacy Commission. The bill prohibits the use of information by a person to whom it is divulged for the purpose other than that for which it was requested. Information from the register will not be linked with other Commonwealth databases. State and territory bodies will be required to give written confirmation to comply with the secrecy provision of the act before the information is released.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implementation of the register will provide information which is not currently available about immunisation coverage. It will enable the Commonwealth, states and territories to better manage immunisation programs. The objective is to increase coverage rates to an extent that disease transmission is interrupted. Experience in other countries has demonstrated that this is an achievable goal. The establishment of the register is fundamental to achieving this objective. I table the explanatory memorandum.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I make my remarks, I thank the members present for their cooperation when we thought that another debate in the House of Representatives chamber was going to cause some need for me to be in two places at the one time. I appreciate the arrangements that people made in the interim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition welcomes the government's introduction of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill on childhood immunisation. We welcome this decision because, in effect, it continues the previous government's initiative in childhood immunisation. The Labor government's original legislation established the national childhood immunisation register with the aim of improving our national performance by setting up a national system to remind parents about the timing of the necessary immunisations for their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation also places appropriate privacy controls on the immunisation information and, very importantly, allows some parents to opt out of the system if they so choose, although the aggregate information will still be collected for public health purposes, which is commendable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although we strongly support the continuation of this national register, it is important to draw a contrast between this legislation and the government's policy in other areas. We have heard in recent months that, because of overlaps between federal and state responsibilities, the federal government intends accelerating the process of handing over powers and responsibilities to the states, not least aged care and some of the other responsibilities of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my concerns about the government's decision to accelerate the handover of these responsibilities to the states is the difficulties that have arisen in the last decade as the states took on additional responsibilities in childhood immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We found that when states had full responsibility for funding community health initiatives, state treasuries were quick to look at ways of making cutbacks and shutting down community health centres and baby health centres, which ultimately affected the nation's ability to ensure that as many of our Australian kids as possible were properly immunised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that both sides of politics are supporting this national childhood immunisation register demonstrates that when there is a real need in health, education or transport, it is often only the national government that has the resources to respond. Through the national childhood immunisation register both sides of politics are trying to address this need in our community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6233">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to also remember that the former government not only funded the register but also agreed to meet the cost of some of the vaccines. That is also something which only the national government could have done and demonstrates once again that when important issues arise you often need the financial power and ability of the Commonwealth to deliver a service to every Australian wherever they may live&mdash;and that often makes the difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the present government also agrees that it is critically important that the Commonwealth take over this vital area of public health and that is why we have the concerns that I have already mentioned. We do not want to see different standards and levels of care develop whether it is for aged care, education or lists of drugs available under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the worst recent example of the government's appalling record in trying to hand over responsibilities to the states has been the decision in this budget to abolish the Commonwealth dental health program with the ridiculous claim that state governments would pick up the slack.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="WORTH" NAMEID="8V5">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8V5">Ms Worth</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has always been the states' responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly before 1993 that was the case. In dental health care, as in childhood immunisation, the states cannot do enough on their own. In 1993 a report showed that disadvantaged people were twice as likely to have teeth extracted rather than filled or repaired. There is probably no better argument in favour of the Commonwealth continuing to be involved in that area of public health than the fact that so many people were not getting access to what most of us would consider a basic right&mdash;that is, to have your tooth repaired and maintained rather than simply pulled out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the budget, state health ministers, Labor, Liberal and National, have made it clear that they certainly will not be topping up the funds, replacing the federal funds that have been withdrawn in dental health care. The same would happen if the federal government sought to hand over childhood immunisation responsibilities to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a couple of brief comments about some recent media stories about immunisation. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quantum</EMPHASIS> program on ABC television ran several stories warning the community about some of the risks associated with immunisation. An organisation such as the ABC with its proud record of many stories on public health issues also has a responsibility to be careful about some of the stories it broadcasts. It has to be careful not to needlessly alarm the public about the risks associated with immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some concerns about whether or not balance was achieved in that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quantum</EMPHASIS> program. But I certainly commend the ABC for Dr Norman Swan's subsequent program on Radio National which presented a more balanced attitude to some of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that all of us accept that when people receive injections, or take medication, there is always a certain amount of risk that they could have a reaction to that medication, or the vaccine. But the chances of their health being affected in a negative way are more than outweighed by the benefits that young children, in particular, receive from immunisation. So we can only hope that all elements of the media try to take a responsible attitude in reporting these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, we in the opposition welcome the bill. In particular, we welcome its recognition of the crucial role of the Commonwealth government in making sure that national health priorities are met, and we urge the government to reconsider its intentions to give funding and control of a large number of other vital community health programs to the states that clearly have a demonstrably poor record on many of these issues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the 1920s, the Commonwealth has undertaken to immunise against rubella, measles, the pertussis&mdash;otherwise known as whooping cough&mdash;meningitis, diphtheria and tetanus. This strategy is good preventive medicine and these immunisation programs have built upon, and are consistent with, the outstanding success of the World Health Organisation at eradicating smallpox.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, in itself, is an argument for Australia's ongoing support of the World Health Organisation and associated efforts by the United Nations to rid the planet of these diseases. Anyone advocating Australia's withdrawal from the United Nations would best remember the unilateral efforts Australia is engaged in at the international level which benefit the health of people living right here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, complacency can creep in, and I agree with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), in calling upon the media to be responsible in the way they deal with these matters. On top of complacency, if there is any scaremongering about the side effects of immunisation, that can have a detrimental effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the previous speaker said, with any medication there is always a very slight risk of a reaction which is undesirable. But for the overall public health of a community we must ensure that reliable information is out about the benefits of immunisation programs. In Australia, whooping cough and measles killed 457 children between 1980 and 1990 and in a survey conducted in 1992 it was revealed that up to 17 per cent of all children remain unvaccinated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have also been concerns that immunisation levels are lower for children from lower income families, Aboriginal communities and recent immigrants. When I was in Alice Springs, though, I was made aware that where programs of immunisation are well conducted by Aboriginal health workers themselves in their own communities the level of immunisation is actually at a higher level than in the wider Australian community. I think that those efforts must be recognised and those people commended for their efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also the unfortunate fact that some parents and guardians remain unaware of the real threat to the health of their children, the need to complete an immunisation program once that has been commenced, and the need to remain vigilant in combating disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1995&hyphen;96 budget, the Australian immunisation register was established to monitor immunisation coverage and to assist parents in the collation of information. The legislation was a response to a failure on the part of the states to adequately monitor immunisation coverage with consistency or methodology. Immunisation strategies are, by their very nature, a Commonwealth concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACIR commenced operations from the beginning of this year and nearly half a million immunisations were registered by April. The Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1996, now before the committee, deals specifically with the relationship between the ACIR and the Health Insurance Commission, and the current situation where the ACIR is prevented from sharing information with immunisation providers and the relevant state and territory immunisation bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, this also restricts the ability of the HIC to remind parents that the next stage of their child's immunisation program is due. This bill will help ensure that Australia's national strategies and our contributions to international efforts to wipe out the diseases I have mentioned will be that much more effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the desire to enhance the reporting ability and the distribution of information from the HIC, the Privacy Commissioner has expressed some concerns with the primary legislation to be enacted to address privacy and confidentiality issues. The Health Insurance Amendment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6235"> Bill does enable the HIC to provide requested information to parents including important reminder notices. All children up to six years of age enrolled in Medicare will be included on the register and children not on Medicare records can be added by their local general practitioner. This bill ensures that no information about individuals, unless parental permission is given, will be divulged to relevant immunisation groups. However, cumulative information to implement regional strategies and identify outbreaks will now be available. This is an important measure which enjoys bipartisan support. We must be continually improving and updating our national immunisation program and, I hope, looking at what the latest medical research shows. I commend this bill to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an occasion when all parties in the parliament are working together for a very good cause and that is concern about preventable diseases and the protection of our young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We keep getting arguments about the need to rationalise responsibility between the various levels of government: federal, state and local government. In fact, immunisation has been traditionally an area that covered all three. Whilst I can understand why we would want to go for simple solutions, giving clear responsibility, it is not always possible. I think we are dealing here with an instance where that is the case. As much as some people&mdash;and I certainly do not share this view&mdash;might say, `Well, look, get the Commonwealth out of health completely and let the lines of responsibility and accountability be clear,' I come from the perspective that that is not always going to be possible. There is a legitimate role for the Commonwealth in health and sometimes when you devolve responsibilities it can be done with disastrous consequences. Our shadow minister, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), has already outlined that part of the regrettable result has been that immunisation rates in Australia have been dropping dramatically since this responsibility was devolved to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a tragedy that in a country that we are all so proud of&mdash;Australia, with its relatively high standard of living&mdash;we can still be getting cases of reportable instances of illnesses in our young people that can be prevented by immunisation. I was very pleased that the shadow minister touched on the sensitive issue of concern by some parents and some groups within the community about the risks associated with vaccination. He is so right that in anything we do, even if it is just taking things like aspirin or penicillin, it is quite possible that people may have an allergic reaction but if we were to cease immunising&mdash;if we were to in fact recommend that people should not be immunised&mdash;what we would really be prescribing is more young Australians dying. I do not think any member in the parliament would stand up and feel comfortable with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Health Insurance Amendment Bill sets out to provide a permanent status for the register of people who are being immunised and an automatic follow&hyphen;up system so that they can be reminded of the need to be immunised. At the same time people can opt out of that automatic reminder. That is their choice but I would certainly plead on their children's behalf that they do not do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I talked about the conflict between the different roles of the Commonwealth and states in the health sphere, and I want to give this second chamber an illustration of my frustrations and details of a very disturbing case that came to light today. I previously made representations on behalf of a young constituent, who is a pensioner in my electorate, about putting Daivonex cream back on the PBS system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister did not actually write back but I got advice that the manufacturer was considering reapplying for the listing. If it had been listed then this problem may not have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6236"> arisen, but the issue is that it was not. Unfortunately, my constituent was still in need of this prescription and went to a local chemist shop and was delighted when she was able to buy, for $25, this medication that would normally cost $50. If you are on social security benefits you can understand just what a tremendous saving this was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy is that she bought it in September and its use&hyphen;by date was April and she has now had a severe reaction to it. She has gone to a doctor and to the specialist and is now awaiting the specialist's report, but her skin has been burnt and she is in some agony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is where the issue of accountability in health becomes a little difficult. Clearly, for example, chemists are regulated by pharmaceutical boards. I think it was completely unethical of the chemist in my electorate to sell out&hyphen;of&hyphen;date medication; absolutely unethical. I am surprised that there are not safety systems in place to prevent it, but I am sure that the state minister for health, after my representations, will be ensuring that this matter gets the proper ethical treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because it is not on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme it comes under the federal Therapeutic Goods Act. I say to the minister: what are the safeguards to ensure that this sort of incident does not recur? I find it distressing that it has happened once. The thought that a chemist in my electorate feels that, because we are just ordinary working&hyphen;class people, they can dump out&hyphen;of&hyphen;date medications on my constituents and they will not complain, I find horrific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am keen to learn from the minister&mdash;and the relevant minister is very sympathetic to this case&mdash;what the safeguards are to ensure that this is not a rort, that this is a one&hyphen;off case. I want to see a full measure of justice for my constituent. Unfortunately, I understand that we may not be able to restore her looks and relieve the pain she is going through, but if there is anything that should come out of this I want to ensure that this does not happen again. No chemist on the North Shore, no chemist in the eastern suburbs would dare do it, but because we are ordinary working class people they do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like an assurance from the minister that the full measure of federal authority will be brought to ensure that this cannot happen again. If there is an organised rort, I hope the principals will be brought to justice. But here you have a case where, depending on whether a medication is on PBS or whether it is not on PBS, it circumscribes in some way the responsibility of the federal and the state governments. I am confident that Minister Wooldridge and Dr Refshauge will fully cooperate and investigate this quite horrific case. I sincerely hope that it is just limited to this one instance, but I have no confidence in that statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to the bill, in immunisation we need cooperation between the state and federal governments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Kaitlyn Gooding is six weeks of age. She lies in her cot in the childrens' hospital attached to an oxygen monitor by a network of tubes. Kaitlyn has whooping cough. Her coughing spasms can last up to three minutes as she struggles to get a breath. She coughs continually, going red in the face and, after a spasm, may vomit or even scream or cry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6237">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Her mother said it has been awful, she has been waking up distressed and has had spasms and then screamed&mdash;and she is normally a very placid baby. Kaitlyn has been coughing for about three weeks now. At first the doctors thought it was something minor, but one night she went blue and was rushed to hospital. The sad thing is that Kaitlyn and her parents had to unnecessarily experience this terrible ordeal, which could have been fatal, because other people had failed to immunise their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease that affects the air passages and causes difficulty in breathing. Severe coughing spasms occur and between these spasms the child gasps for breath causing the characteristic whoop. It is most serious in babies under 12 months of age, often requiring admission to hospital. Complications can include haemorrhaging, convulsions, pneumonia, coma, inflammation of the brain, permanent brain damage and long&hyphen;term lung damage. One in around every 200 children under six months of age who catch whooping cough will die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy is that whooping cough is just one of eight diseases that can be prevented by routine childhood immunisation. Others are diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, rubella and Haemophilus influenzae type B, commonly known as HIB. Diphtheria causes a membrane to grow inside the throat that leads to difficulty in swallowing, breathlessness and suffocation. A powerful poison is produced and diphtheria bacteria may spread throughout the body. About 10 per cent of the people who contract diphtheria die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tetanus enters the body through a wound that may be as small as a pinhead and it attacks the nervous system causing severe muscle spasms, first felt in the neck and jaw muscles. The effects spread causing breathing difficulties, painful convulsions and abnormal heart rhythms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immunisation is the only effective way of giving children protection against these diseases. Immunisation has saved tens of thousands of Australian children from death and handicap and the benefit of protection against these diseases far outweighs the small risk of immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If enough people in the community are immunised the infection can no longer be spread from person to person and eventually the disease will die out. Since the introduction of routine childhood vaccination, smallpox has been eliminated from the world, polio removed from many countries and tetanus, diphtheria and measles are now uncommon. The threat of whooping cough has been reduced and we look forward to a virtual elimination of HIB, mumps and congenital rubella syndrome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As more children are protected by immunisation, the prevalence of infectious diseases and people's attitude to these diseases has modified. Diseases are perceived as being less threatening and people start to feel that the immunisation is less important, and it is at this point that these diseases will re&hyphen;occur with a vengeance. In this context immunisation will be viewed as a victim of its own success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every parent wants their child to be protected from unnecessary illness, but they will only have their child immunised if they consider the risk from infectious disease serious and believe the vaccine is safe. For example, between 1983 and 1993 in Australia there were 41 preventable deaths caused by measles. Measles is a highly infectious disease and complications include encephalitis, pneumonia and ear infections which leave some children permanently damaged. I personally taught a child who had suffered ear infection and thereby was severely deaf as a result of a measles attack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between March and April 1995, there were 290 notifications of measles in Australia compared with only four in the United Kingdom. These are amazing statistics considering the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6238"> United Kingdom's massive population when compared with Australia. I was shocked to read the Australian Bureau of Statistics study which shows that only 33 per cent of children aged three months to six years are fully immunised against mumps, polio, measles, whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus, HIB and rubella. I was brought up with a mother who was a community and child welfare nurse who advocated that all children should be immunised and all children should be christened. I do not quite know why the two went together, but I always had that instilled in me, so I found these results absolutely amazing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The survey highlights that while vaccination rates were up for measles, mumps and polio, the rates for diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough fell sharply. This would explain why over 4,000 cases of whooping cough were reported in 1995. This government is determined to turn this situation around because there is no greater public health obligation that a country has to its children than to protect them from vaccine preventable illnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased Dr Wooldridge committed himself, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> radio program, to provide leadership on this issue and to make sure that we raise the awareness that without immunisation we are exposing our children to very great risks. Immunisation will be a chief public health issue for the rest of the decade. With just 54 per cent of children immunised, we have the lowest level of child immunisation in the Western world. In fact, we rank 26 out of 28 in the Western world for complete childhood immunisation. Last year the rates for measles, german measles and whooping cough were 17 times the rate of five years ago. This means we are going to have more young boys becoming sterile from the complications of measles, babies being deformed from the complications of german measles and young children dying of whooping cough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year marks the bicentenary of the administration of the first smallpox vaccination developed by the father of immunisation, Edward Jenner. The development of immunisation during this century is one of the greatest medical successes, enabling health workers to prevent rather than treat disease. However, it is a national disgrace that, 200 years after Edward Jenner began his immunisation work, half of Australia's children have not been fully immunised. The government has made a major commitment to lifting childhood immunisation rates and, in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, we have emphasised the importance of national childhood immunisation programs. To protect children from life&hyphen;threatening, preventable diseases, $2.5 million will be allocated in 1996&hyphen;97 in addition to the existing funding commitments. Consistent with the government's commitment to health throughout life, the program will be funded at $17 million in 1997&hyphen;98 and $15 million in 1998&hyphen;99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, no state or territory has been able to provide immunisation coverage estimates which can identify groups at risk of disease through incomplete immunisation. The government will make the national immunisation register an ongoing program item, with funding guaranteed beyond June 1997. And in consultation with the states and territories and with reference to the national register, the government will be able to set immunisation targets for mumps, measles and whooping cough. At the end of each financial year, the government will undertake an annual analysis of Australia&hyphen;wide performance and publish the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will use funding incentives to encourage state and territory governments to exceed their childhood immunisation targets. The government recognises there is still a concern in the community about the perceived risks of immunisation and also that some parents neglect booster immunisations for their children. The government will, therefore, fund a major ongoing publicity campaign through television, radio and popular magazines to advise <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6239"> parents about the importance of immunisation and the relative risks of not using a complete immunisation program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is anticipated that, for the first time, the national immunisation register will provide a comprehensive, effective management tool for monitoring immunisation coverage and for improving service delivery. Practitioners and immunisation providers have responded with enthusiasm to the new program, and already a significant amount of information has been recorded on the register. Indications are that the register will grow to provide a comprehensive and valuable measure of immunisation coverage in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1996 will enable the Health Insurance Commission to release information from the register to prescribed bodies, for purposes relating to the immunisation or health of children. This information will identify areas of high risk and will enable immunisation programs, including education programs, to be effectively targeted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anti&hyphen;immunisation proponents propose that allowing a wild infection to occur in a healthy host engenders strong immunity. However, frequently, healthy unimmunised children will die from a vaccine preventable disease. Such advocacy is mischievous and, in view of the efficacy of immunisation, inexcusable. If none of the children in a child&hyphen;care centre of 150 were immunised and a whooping cough outbreak occurred, about 135 children would come down with the disease. On average, one child would get encephalitis. If every child in the centre were immunised correctly with four doses of DTP, the odds would be that possibly one child every 170 years could get encephalitis as a result of immunisation. Dr Aileen Aitken's article <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's low immunisation rates: who is to blame?</EMPHASIS> sums up this debate perfectly. She writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If somebody came into Australia and took 10,000&hyphen;12,000 children hostage and as a result some were so badly hurt they required hospitalisation and several of them died, it would be an absolute outrage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments would act, the papers would be full of it, it would be on the news for weeks and the general population would be horrified. And yet, this is about the same number of children who have had vaccine&hyphen;preventable diseases each year for the last two or three years.</PARA>
<PARA>The facts for immunisation speak for themselves. Smallpox has been eradicated. Polio has been eliminated from many countries and, in Australia, the reduction in mortality cannot fail to impress. There has been a 91 per cent reduction in the incidence of measles since immunisation began in 1970; a 99 per cent reduction in tetanus and whooping cough; and a 100 per cent reduction in diphtheria and polio. Vaccination is the most cost&hyphen;effective means of disease prevention and control. All medical practitioners should ensure that their patients, both children and adults, are adequately immunised against all vaccine preventable diseases. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice there have been some important things referred to the Main Committee recently, but the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1996 is probably one of the more important pieces of legislation that will be passed through this parliament. It is important in the sense that it will preserve the health and, indeed, the lives of many Australian children and those of many who are yet to be born.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian childhood immunisation register commenced operation under Health Insurance Commission regulations on 1 January this year, and this bill provides the establishment and maintenance of the register in primary legislation. It also provides the release of information from the register to specified bodies and persons. The establishment of the register is necessary to address continuing epidemics of vaccine preventable diseases.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6240">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that vaccination and immunisation have been hoist with their own petard in the sense that a younger generation of Australians thinks that in some way these diseases no longer exist when worldwide something like three million children die every year from the vaccine preventable diseases which this register will cover. The current levels of vaccination in Australia are such that only 53 per cent of Australian children are fully immunised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The information contained on the register will provide parents or guardians with an optional recall or reminder system which will inform parents or guardians when their child's next immunisation is due or past due. We have reminders for vaccinations of pets&mdash;and I am sure the member for Cowan ( Mr Richard Evans) is aware of that from recent times&mdash;for the registration of cars, and for dental screenings; so why not have reminders for something as important as the immunisation of a child? In this sense, the previous government and, indeed, this government, are to be commended for taking the lead; although, as things develop, there will be people in the private sector who will clearly be involved in the recall and reminder system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The register will also provide an effective management tool for monitoring immunisation coverage. Once identified, areas of low immunisation coverage can be further identified, enabling states and territories to specifically target education activities and resources. The register will be established by taking all records of immunisations received by the Health Insurance Commission after 1 January this year and transferring them to the register.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents who wish to are able to opt out of the recall and reminder system and, although I have some discomfort with that personally, I can understand the reasons for allowing that. Initially it will be operated by the Health Insurance Commission but, with the passage of time, it might be possible for it to be operated by immunisation providers recognised by the commission. But, before we can do that, we need to be satisfied that first and foremost the children are being immunised, that the register is working effectively and that the recall and reminder systems are going out before we devolve it too much into the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth will establish, and in fact has established, bilateral agreements with states and territories to cost share the data collection fee up to a maximum of $6 for immunisation. There is also a commitment to provide $3 reimbursement to recognised immunisation providers for the provision of data about NH&amp;MRC&mdash;recommended immunisation episodes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard, whilst I would be the last person to argue that providers should be paid less for what they do, I think people ought to understand that whilst the $3 payment is appreciated, certainly by medical practitioners, in itself it is not the major driving force for immunising children. But it does recognise that there is time that a medical practitioner needs to spend complying with the necessary paperwork and administration of the register.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The estimated cost of the data collection component of the register is $2.43 million in 1995&hyphen;96, going to $4.93 million in 1996&hyphen;97. That is quite a modest expenditure when you consider what is at stake here. The funding allocated to the commission to establish and administer the register is just over $3 million in this financial year and $3.3 million for 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to make some general remarks about immunisation. Some members of the community may find it offensive, but I feel that it needs to be said. Immunisation is one of the most powerful and cost&hyphen;effective weapons against disease. With the exception of safe water, there is no other mechanism&mdash;in fact, not even antibiotics&mdash;which has had such a major effect on reducing death and improving population growth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6241">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other speakers have referred in passing to possible complications and accidents that may occur with immunisation. Like so many other important and significant public health measures, it represents a price that we pay for the protection that vaccines confer upon us. When you think about it, it is due to the large number of vaccine doses that are being administered at an early age when children are prone to various illnesses, and it is probable that there will be some temporal and time&hyphen;related and merely coincidental association between adverse events and vaccine administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know from personal experience that, because you have children who are being vaccinated&mdash;certainly in the first year of life&mdash;roughly every eight weeks, if something adverse happens to the child it should not surprise us that parents and concerned relatives attribute whatever may happen to the child to the vaccine when, of course, in the first year of life especially, children are particularly susceptible to common diseases, some of them quite serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put it into proper perspective, in the 1970s, for example, the fear of pertussis vaccine&mdash;whooping cough vaccine&mdash;reactions in the United Kingdom reduced immunisation rates from about 70 or 80 per cent down to less than 40 per cent. Subsequently, of course, there was an outbreak of pertussis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vaccines, as I said earlier, are victims of their own success. As diseases decline, adverse reactions gain in relative importance and the perception of risk as against benefit changes. One of the areas where Aboriginal people in particular are leading non&hyphen;Aboriginal Australia is in the area of immunisation, and I noticed the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) referring to that earlier in her address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, immunisation rates for children in the Top End of the Territory are in excess of 95 per cent. The reason for that, as I can tell you from my observations of aid development programs in Kenya and Tanzania, is that when people see children dying on a daily or a weekly basis from diseases, you have absolutely no trouble whatsoever convincing them of the benefits of immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there were to be developed and launched today a safe and effective vaccine for AIDS, there would be a considerable queue lining up to receive it. In other words, people do not need to be convinced about the benefits of receiving it. Certainly, in the 1950s, when polio vaccine became available, most Australians did not need to be convinced that this was a good thing to go and get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media have a tremendous public health role to play by avoiding the transmission of sensational and, at times, biased and unfounded information about risks, when weighing them up against benefits. Recently, when I was on a plane, I saw an episode of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline</EMPHASIS> which is a program that sends up current affairs television, and the producer of this fictitious program was very anxious to run a killer vaccine story because it would be very good for ratings. That, of course, is an extreme illustration of the irresponsibility of some people who permeate sections of the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the best work that has been done on risk&hyphen;benefit ratios in relation to immunisation was done by a researcher called Holden, and published in 1987. He calculated the benefit&hyphen;harm ratio for common vaccinations. For example, the risk of dying from whooping cough, or suffering a serious complication of it, is 7,995 times higher than any risk at all conferred by the vaccine. The risk of getting tetanus and dying from it is 4,640 times higher than any risk conferred by the vaccine. Despite the fact we have not had a case of polio in Australia for over 10 years now, the risk of the problems from it are 990 times higher than any risk from the vaccine. The risks from measles, about which some parents, fuelled by some irresponsible <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6242"> sections of the community, including even the medical community, are 60,840 times higher than any risk at all conferred by immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also calculated that in developed countries like our own&mdash;excluding the Aboriginal community&mdash;immunisation could prevent about 45 childhood deaths and 12 serious handicaps every month. In contrast, the program could cause one death every 22 years and one serious handicap every 7&half; years. And that is in developed countries right throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some other points need to be made. For example, if you look at the 1981 outbreak of measles in New South Wales when the population was only 5.2 million, you will see that there were 2,200 hospital admissions, five deaths and a cost of $2 million in medical services. Middle ear infection, pneumonia, encephalitis are worth mentioning. For instance, you run a 1:2,000 risk of getting encephalitis if you contract measles and a 1:3,000 risk of death. Despite that sort of information, I remain surprised that some parents still need to be persuaded about the benefits of immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred earlier to the fact that only 53 per cent of children up to the age of six are being fully immunised, 30 per cent are only partly immunised, and 20 per cent are unimmunised, or their status is unknown. That, of course, is what this register and recall system is intended to address. Those figures are from the ABS national health survey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very good example of how we can achieve good things when both sides of politics work together. But those of us who are concerned for low income earners in Australia ought to be reminded that the poorest coverage for immunisation is amongst lower socioeconomic groups. Sixty&hyphen;five per cent of those earning less than $10,000 a year have their children immunised, whereas 85 per cent of those earning more than $70,000 a year have their children vaccinated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the problems that we have had include the  fragmented funding arrangements between the public and the private sectors. Among the three levels of government there has been, at times, a lack of accountability. There has been poor data collection not only in relation to immunisation but also in relation to expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has also been an enormous amount of effort put by governments of all political persuasions into cost shifting in relation to immunisation. Vaccine purchasing has, to say the least, been uncoordinated. Prices at times have been inflated due to the monopoly of supply. We have seen failures in the cold chain which the previous government and the National Health and Medical Research Council have worked very hard to address and we are hoping will be also addressed by the implementation of general practice accreditation. There has been fragmentation of delivery networks, poor record keeping, monitoring and recall, the last of which of course, this bill will actually address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make some other points. If you look at a disease like measles, for example, you will see that we have had 136 cases this year to date, 1,284 cases last year, 4,895 cases in the previous year and 4,536 cases in 1993. There were 41 measles deaths in the decade from 1983 to 1993 and 57 Australian children died from whooping cough and measles in the decade from 1980 to 1990. Our vaccination rates in Australia, with the exception of Aboriginal people, as I said earlier, are poorer than countries like Tanzania, Iran, Colombia and Tunisia. That is not something of which we ought to be proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that I would like to make is that those people in the community who promote homoeopathic vaccines should be reminded that they are just that; they confer no immunity whatsoever; there is no scientific evidence that so&hyphen;called natural therapies or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6243"> homoeopathic vaccines provide any protection for a child at all. I never cease to be amazed when I hear parents saying that they do not want their child vaccinated because they might get a red lump or they might get a fever or that the neighbour's child was vaccinated and vomited for a day when what they are effectively doing is exposing their children, who are clearly precious and wanted, to something from which they could become seriously ill and in fact even die. You would not suggest to a parent that you would not restrain your child in a safety cot or that you would not put a seat belt on your child because you are frightened they might get bruised in an accident and yet that logic, which clearly says they are much safer in child&hyphen;care restraints in cars, does not apply in some cases to immunisation. I think doctors, in particular, who use their medical education to give legitimacy to some extremely dangerous views in relation to so&hyphen;called alternative vaccination, ought to be facing disciplinary action. I think it is no less of a disciplinary matter than a doctor who misses a case of pneumonia, than a doctor who misses meningococcal septicaemia, than a doctor who misses renal failure in a diabetic. To advise a parent that they should not have their child vaccinated against polio, measles, mumps, rubella, Haemophilus influenzae B or mengingitis and, instead, to take something which confers no scientific immunity at all as far as I am concerned is nothing less than medical negligence and throughout my public life I will pursue doctors who promote those sorts of views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise that this is going beyond the bill but I have a reputation for being a troublemaker so I may as well continue in that vein! I cannot get my dog into a boarding kennel unless I have a vaccination certificate. I cannot get it in there for a week just to be looked after if I want a break because, if the dog has a disease&mdash;if it has not been vaccinated&mdash;it represents a risk to the others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a similar sense, if we have low levels of immunity in society for vaccine preventable diseases, we expose children who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons&mdash;children whose immunity is suppressed, for example, through leukemia and cytotoxic drugs or children who are highly allergic to eggs, for example, and cannot be vaccinated against measles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask myself: when are we going to live in a country where, prior to school entry, it will be necessary to present in every state and jurisdiction of Australia, evidence that the child has been vaccinated or, if the parent is a conscientious objector, that they have in fact been counselled by a medical practitioner&mdash;similarly for child&hyphen;care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise in some parts of Australia that this kind of program has commenced but whilst we&mdash;and particularly on this side of the chamber&mdash;value individual freedoms, there comes a time when people exercising their so&hyphen;called freedoms seriously threaten the health and lives of others. It is time for us to say no. We think it is very much in the interests of everybody, including the children in question, that they be vaccinated and some very strong mechanisms should be put in place to see that effect is given to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I will continue to advocate, at a personal level, that parents be required to show evidence of vaccination when a child goes into child care and/or at the time of school entry. If they are conscientious objectors&mdash;and I respect the fact that there are people like this around&mdash;then at least they have been counselled and a document has been signed to the effect that they understand the risks they are exposing their children to, but have nonetheless agreed to not have them vaccinated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend this bill to the House. I also give credit to the previous government. I was a very strong critic of the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) when she was the health minister. I thought: what kind of health minister cannot get a $23 million immunisation package through <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6244"> the ERC and then the cabinet process in the 1994 budget? But she made a comeback on immunisation in 1994, and I give credit to her and to the previous government for that. We are now very determined to follow this through. Much of the reason this has been given such a high priority is the personal commitment of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) not only to immunisation but to diabetes and other very important public health initiatives. I will be very keen to support this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise with some enthusiasm to support the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1996. I would like to take a different tack from other speakers and speak on a broader subject relating to something very dear to my heart&mdash;and my heart is my electorate. This legislation deals with one element of a suite of initiatives by the new government to address a very serious problem, that is, attracting doctors and medical practitioners to rural areas. And my electorate is no exception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the main initiative of the bill is to reduce the spiralling growth in Medicare payments, I can see that it will be of significant value in manipulating the position to some extent in attracting doctors to rural areas. When this is coupled with the additional announcements by the minister yesterday regarding overseas doctors, I will be watching anxiously for some benefits in the immediate short term. This is major reform and it is very difficult to explain, but I am committed to the concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me share some of the experiences I have had over the last three years as the federal member for Mallee, in north&hyphen;west Victoria. There are 24 hospitals in my electorate, spread right across it in the large communities, the provincial centres and very small communities. In a period of three years I have been involved actively in the placement of doctors for 12 of those 24. It is interesting that of the 12 doctors, who include some specialists, only two have been Australian doctors. It is quite a serious problem in my electorate and a serious problem right across the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the changes in the bill specifically relate to the requirement for medical graduates to complete postgraduate education in order to gain access to Medicare benefits. This is not about restricting employment options of doctors. It is limiting to some extent the unfettered access in a private practice to Medicare support underwritten by taxpayers. I can see that what this will do is require medical students to think about a different career option than necessarily practising in private practice. Many of my hospitals have complained that a young doctor is more interested in going into private practice, and the enticement of a Medicare provider number makes it just that much easier for him to do that. So the hospitals are left without vital medical support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill results from a 1996 budget decision to restrict access to the Medicare system. Whilst it is often referred to as a decision to restrict the number of Medicare provider numbers, it is not that at all. I am having some difficulty explaining this to young graduates, a number of whom come from my electorate. But I hope they can see the broader vision. This is part of a major reform and, in conjunction with other major initiatives being announced by the government, will once and for all address this serious problem I have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this is strongly linked to the supply of doctors in Australia. It has been reported that the Australian Institute of Health estimates that there is an oversupply of some 4,500 doctors right across the nation and a shortage of 500 general practitioners across rural areas. That is an ongoing frustration for those of us who represent that large proportion of Australia. To illustrate the comparison between metropolitan and rural areas, I can cite two examples. One is from New South Wales where there are 183 GPs per 100,000 people in Sydney, while the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6245"> lowest number recorded is 68 doctors per 100,000 in the Murrumbidgee region&mdash;a significant rural area of that state.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, all of my comments relate to the very immediate problem I have. I would point out to you that in Mildura, a provincial city with 22,000 people, they are currently seeking nine doctors and specialists. It is a very urgent problem for me. I believe that this piece of legislation relates to a whole suite of those coming before the parliament on a very specific policy by the government to address this very vital problem I have. All of the remarks I wish to make relate to that very vital question. So if you wish to rule me out of order, then I will cease and allow the parliament to get on with more urgent business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say how grateful I am that these initiatives are receiving some bipartisan support. The previous government attempted as best it could, valiantly but unsuccessfully, to address the problem. We are now comprehensively addressing it. I just hope that in the next three years of my operations as a federal member, I will not have to have so much of my time involved in going right through the processes of medical registration and then those of the department of immigration, which can take 18 months. This can leave a hospital without medical support and puts its financial status at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This very nearly occurred in the community of Manangatang. Two years ago, there was a deficit of $250,000. This Sunday, in conjunction with the current doctor who is there, I announced to the community that there was a new doctor. That is two doctors in a township of 300 people, but both doctors are foreign doctors, not Australian. That just highlights the point. But the fact is that the presence of the doctor has turned the hospital around financially and at the annual general meeting of the hospital a profit of $140,000 was announced. That is testimony to the necessity to have a good doctor and it is very sad that we have to rely on foreign doctors to achieve that. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will be making further remarks along those lines on the more relevant bill, as you suggest.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.51 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to address the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1996. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that my comments will be relevant to the bill at hand. This bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to bring the Australian childhood immunisation register into primary legislation. The register was originally established by regulation but the Privacy Commissioner expressed concerns that, in the interests of protecting the information contained in the register, it should be brought into primary legislation. The bill also allows the release of information from the register to specified persons and bodies in specific circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The register was established because vaccine preventable diseases are once again becoming prevalent in the Australian community and that causes me a great deal of difficulty. I have real problems with that. I recall that a few years ago Rotary International, in a program which was well supported and backed by all Rotary Clubs throughout Australia, went out into the worldwide community to collect millions of dollars to try to eradicate polio. It was not meant that any of the money would be spent in countries such as Australia&mdash;that is, developed Western societies&mdash;but that it would be spent on the less developed and the underdeveloped nations of our world to try to give children a greater chance at life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I absolutely supported that program. It was an important program. It is unconscionable that we in Australia today face the fact that an ABS survey has found that only 53 per cent of children aged between birth and six years of age in 1989&hyphen;1990 were fully immunised, with another 29.5 per cent partially immunised. We have fallen way behind. The indication is that current rates of immunisation are so low that diseases such as measles, pertussis, which is whooping cough, and rubella are today more common than they were a decade ago. That is unconscionable. We should be taking care of our children and making sure that they are immunised against these preventable diseases. We have done the scientific research; we have done the hard yards. We have proved the case and here we are, lax in making sure that our own children are protected from diseases which may maim them, make them very ill or, indeed, take their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In l995, 1,006 cases of measles, 48 cases of HIB, 97 cases of mumps, 2,757 cases of pertussis, 1,662 cases of rubella and three cases of tetanus were reported. There were no cases of diphtheria or polio reported. In fact, there have been no cases of polio reported since 1986. In the period from the 1940s to the 1970s, immunisation was a routine part of early childhood health care. As a result of those successful years of immunisation, many of the vaccine preventable diseases are virtually unknown to the new parents of today. These diseases can still occur and, because of their highly contagious nature, could very quickly spread to our schools and our kindergartens and, therefore, the general population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The register will allow for parents to participate in a recall reminder scheme to inform them when their child's next immunisation is due or past due. This type of system has worked successfully for many years in some local government municipalities in Victoria. I recommend that model to much of Australia because it has been so successful. In that regard, I note that the City of Knox has had an outstanding program and other municipalities might do well to contact it to find out why its program has worked well and what they might do to emulate it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of the Medicare database for establishment and updating of the register will mean that information is more current and more up to date, and the sending of reminder notices will be more regular and more easily obtained. The data available from the register will also enable <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6247"> areas with low immunisation to be more accurately targeted with immunisation specific education and resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because we are looking at a national approach of prevention, perhaps the minister could consider in the future extending the register to cover students from seven to 16 years of age. Such an extension could catch many of those previously not immunised and could take in the teenagers who receive their adult diphtheria and tetanus shots in year 10 of high school. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Doctor</EMPHASIS> magazine of 9 September 1994, Dr Mark Ferson reported that, of 166 cases of pertussis notified in eastern Sydney in 1993, seven per cent were in children aged less than five years, 28 per cent were in children aged five to 14 years and 74 per cent were in people aged 15 years and over. In 1994, pertussis vaccine was approved for use in children aged up to four years, but at the time Dr Ferson wrote that it was likely to be raised in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are genuinely serious about ensuring eradication of vaccine preventable diseases from Australia, we need to make sure that immunisation is kept up to date for all Australians. I wonder how many honourable members are currently immunised against diphtheria, tetanus and polio. Vaccinations do have a limited lifespan and a booster is recommended every 10 years for all of us. It is important that we take the lead in this debate on national immunisation and ensure that our own immunisation coverage is current. I recommend the bill to honourable members and to the Main Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;With only 52 per cent of our nation's children fully immunised, this has presented as a major possible problem. It has been, I believe, a national disgrace that this has been allowed to go on for so long without being checked. The member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) raised one important issue on the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1996, and that was immunisation of children entering child&hyphen;care centres and schools. In that respect, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and to some extent Victoria, although they do not have a compulsory immunisation program, have taken the NHMRC recommendations to introduce legislation requiring parents to provide evidence of immunisation status of children enrolling at child&hyphen;care facilities, preschools and schools. In the event of an outbreak of vaccine preventable diseases, unimmunised children can be readily identified and rapidly excluded from school or child&hyphen;care facilities for their own safety. I know that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) supports that initiative and encourages the other states to follow suit.</PARA></TALK.START>
