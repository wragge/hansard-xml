<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is major structural reform of the way in which this country presents and runs its fiscal policy. The bill fulfils an election promise by this government to make sure that the Australian accounts are presented in a fair and honest manner and to enshrine in legislation a requirement which will govern our government and any future government as to the way in which it will present and improve its financial performance. This is the kind of reform which, when enacted, will be a permanent feature, making sure that Australia's economic policy is run better, making sure that the public is kept better informed, making sure that there is transparency in economic policy in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for improved fiscal outcomes in Australia is clearly demonstrated by the persistence of Commonwealth deficits over the past 25 years, the ratcheting up of Commonwealth general government net debt and falling levels of national saving. Commonwealth general government net debt has increased from around 2.5 per cent of GDP in June 1972 to around 19.2 per cent of GDP currently. Over the past five years, there has been a greater than fivefold increase in Commonwealth general government net debt, which now stands at $93 billion. By this measure alone, there is clearly a need for governments to improve fiscal outcomes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that somehow it is compassionate for governments to spend money they do not have is quite fallacious. Spending money the government does not have is merely racking up debts for future generations and making their lives harder rather than easier. General, continuing deficit spending is selfishness by one generation against the next.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will rectify this situation by implementing institutional arrangements to improve the formulation and reporting of fiscal policy. The need for such arrangements has already been supported by independent bodies such as the National Commission of Audit and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and the framework contained in this bill incorporates many of their recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The improvement of the fiscal position will only be achieved through greater discipline, transparency and accountability in government fiscal policy. The charter of budget honesty will achieve all these outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fiscal discipline will be enhanced by requiring government fiscal policy to be formulated according to principles of sound fiscal management. Transparency and the accountability of government will be substantially increased through improved disclosure of fiscal policy intentions and the regular reporting of information on fiscal developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the charter will prevent future governments going to an election on the basis of outdated and misleading information on the fiscal and economic outlook. In short, this bill will ensure that at all times this government and all future governments can be held accountable for their fiscal and economic policies and thereby provide the basis for a sounder economic performance for the economy as a whole,  sustainable job opportunities for our people and greater accountability of government to the electors whom they serve. I will now describe the main features of the fiscal framework that will be established by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fiscal Policy Formulation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will reform fiscal policy formulation through introducing principles for the sound management of fiscal policy against <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which governments must develop their fiscal strategy. These principles will focus attention on a range of issues that must be addressed if fiscal policy is to be sustainable over time. In doing so, they will establish an appropriate environment for setting and assessing fiscal policy, without restraining government or parliament in their pursuit of other non&hyphen;fiscal objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principles take account of the need to address short-term issues, such as cyclical economic downturns, while recognising the importance of medium-term issues such as the sustainability of government debt and national saving.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presentation of a government fiscal strategy as required by the bill will also increase public awareness of a government's objectives and establish a benchmark for evaluating fiscal performance.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fiscal Reporting</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The charter of budget honesty will also ensure that up-to-date information is available so that a government's performance can be assessed against its fiscal objectives. To achieve this, the bill establishes a formal reporting structure. With each year's budget, a report will be released setting out economic and fiscal projections for the budget year and three forward years. These projections will illustrate the consequences of the adopted fiscal strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further report released midway through the financial year will update the fiscal and economic projections contained in the budget report. The details of fiscal outcomes for the just completed financial year will be presented in a report to be released within three months of the end of that financial year. In addition, an intergenerational report will be produced every five years to report on the long-term sustainability of current fiscal policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: one of the consequences of governments living beyond their means is racking up obligations which narrow the choices of future citizens whose taxes will go to sustaining debt incurred in this generation rather than paying for their own hospitals, schools, roads and the like. We want to get economic policy to a point where it is fair as between generations. And an intergenerational report <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8184"> produced every five years is very much a part of that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reports will provide fundamental information that will allow government performance to be assessed against the objectives set out in the fiscal strategy statement. However, the bill also gives particular attention to ensuring that important fiscal information is available during the election period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now a matter of notoriety that during the last election period the then Labor government was assuring the Australian public that the accounts were in balance when in fact, as the outcome for that financial year showed, the government deficit was $10 billion. We inherited that problem. It became our responsibility to fix the mismanagement and the way in which the then government sought to hide it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it would not be just enough for us to say we will fix their problem. We want to make sure that no other government in future behaves in the way in which the Labor government behaved in the March 1996 election. We want to make sure that behaviour of that standard never occurs again. That is why we intend to make it incumbent for a full and open report to be made about the financial state of the books at the opening of an election campaign and not to be found out by whichever government wins at the close.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill requires the secretaries to the Treasury and the Department of Finance to prepare a pre&hyphen;election report providing an updated assessment of the fiscal and economic outlook. Never again will a government go to an election without the public being aware of the current economic and fiscal situation. Never again will the deception attempted by the Labor Party in the last election be allowed if this legislation is enacted. I call on the Labor opposition, recognising all of that episode for what it was, to support this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the bill provides for more equal access to Treasury and Finance costings of election commitments by the government and the opposition during the caretaker period. This will allow the electorate to be better informed of the financial implications of election commitments.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, Mr Speaker, the government believes that the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 represents a landmark development in the conduct of fiscal policy and reporting of fiscal outcomes. It is the kind of reform which, when enacted, will change: the way in which elections are conducted; the way in which policies are implemented; the way in which future generations are brought into consideration in economic decision making; and our economic policy for the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will provide a strong impetus towards achieving better fiscal outcomes by providing greater discipline in policy formulation, regular statements of fiscal objectives and increased accountability for fiscal performance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill contains two important amendments announced in the 1996 budget to clarify the circumstances in which compensation is payable pursuant to the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme. The amendments will bring increased financial stability to the scheme whilst maintaining the government's commitment to providing a safe and healthy working environment and fair compensation for any employee who suffers a work&hyphen;related injury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In proposing the amendments, the government has considered a number of factors. We have looked at the basic principles which underpin the workers compensation scheme, assessed the scheme's current performance, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8185"> and made projections regarding the future financial liabilities of the scheme. Attention has also been paid to developments in state and territory jurisdictions, and I note here the recently released interim report of the heads of workers compensation authorities&mdash;the HWCA report&mdash;which contains a number of recommendations to address the major structural and operational problems facing workers compensation systems in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, in 1988 the Commonwealth introduced a new scheme of compensation and rehabilitation for its employees. The aim of the new scheme was to establish a more equitable and cost&hyphen;effective compensation system, a system which minimised the human and financial cost of work&hyphen;related injury and disease while providing adequate compensation for persons who are injured in the course of their employment by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reviewing performance to date, it is clear that the adoption of a more focused approach to prevention, rehabilitation and claims management has reduced the personal and economic costs of injury and disease in Commonwealth employment for a number of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst this is encouraging, workers compensation schemes right across Australia are currently facing upward pressure on their costs. The Commonwealth's liabilities as at 30 June 1995 totalled $1.4 billion, and despite a decrease in the number of claims, an increase in both the complexity and duration of claims is leading to higher program costs. This, coupled with the fact that it is extremely difficult to accurately project future claims liabilities, means that the ultimate financial position of the scheme cannot be taken for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key element of the 1988 reforms was the attempt to clearly specify the circumstances in which compensation was payable. Under the previous legislation, a claimant only needed to show that his or her employment was a contributing factor in the contraction of a disease. This frequently resulted in the Commonwealth being liable to pay compensation for diseases which had little, if any, connection with employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1988 reforms sought to remedy that situation by providing instead that, for a disease to be compensable, employment must have contributed in a material degree to the contraction of the disease. In the second reading speech to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the then Minister for Social Security, the Hon. Brian Howe MP, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the test will require an employee to demonstrate that his or her employment was more than a mere contributing factor in the contraction of the disease. Accordingly, it will be necessary for an employee to show that there is a close connection between the disease and the employment in which he or she is engaged.</PARA>
<PARA>It was believed that this test was firm but fair, and properly balanced the interests of the Commonwealth as an employer, and its employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequent events revealed that the 1988 amendments did not achieve parliament's intentions in this respect. In Re Miers and Commonwealth of Australia v. Comcare, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled that `material' meant pertinent or likely to influence. In other words, a claimant was entitled to receive compensation despite the fact that his or her employment had not significantly or substantially contributed to the contraction of the disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similar decisions in other jurisdictions have progressively extended the liability of employers to cover a growing number of claims for conditions where work is only a minor contributing factor. This distorts the fundamental objective of workers compensation, which is to provide for losses stemming from occupational injury and disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is against this background that a need arises to amend the current definition of `disease' in the SRC Act to strengthen the connection between work and compensable injury by making it abundantly clear that compensation is only payable if a claimant's employment is a significant contributing factor to the disease. To determine whether employment was a significant contributing factor, it will be necessary to have regard to whether a claimant would have contracted the disease if he or she had not been employed with the Commonwealth. In making this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8186"> determination, it may be relevant to look at the nature and duration of the employment, the existence of any medical predisposing factors affecting the claimant's health, the activities of the claimant outside the workplace or any other matter affecting the claimant's health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By restating the threshold requirement of work&hyphen;relatedness, the government is reactivating the original intention of the scheme that, for a disease to be compensable, employment must be a significant or substantial cause of the disease. In particular, where a disease is not the result of a clearly distinguishable incident in the workplace or is attributable to multiple causes, the amendments will properly ensure that Commonwealth employers do not bear the cost of something for which they have only limited, or no actual, moral responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current legislation also seeks to prevent compensation claims being used to obstruct legitimate management action. Accordingly, the legislation contains what is known as an exclusionary provision which provides that compensation is not payable in respect of an injury which arises from reasonable disciplinary action taken against an employee, or a failure by the employee to obtain a promotion, transfer or benefit in connection with employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exclusionary provision applies primarily to claims for occupational stress. However, the provision has been interpreted as confined to injuries arising as a result of formal disciplinary action prescribed by the Public Service Act or action taken pursuant to an award or certified agreement. Therefore, any other management action could form the basis of a compensation claim. Commonwealth employers believe that, in a number of cases, stress claims are being used to register complaints against, or frustrate the taking of, reasonable employment&hyphen;related action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Occupational stress claims are generally high cost claims. In 1994&hyphen;95 the average cost per stress claim was estimated to be $32,200, whilst the average cost for a non&hyphen;stress claim was $8,500. In 1991&hyphen;92 Comcare accepted 1,040 claims for occupational stress. This rose to 1,643 in 1994&hyphen;95. In financial terms, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> overall cost of stress claims has increased from $24 million in 1991&hyphen;92 to $37 million in 1994&hyphen;95, which represented 30 per cent of premium&hyphen;related program costs paid out in that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has adopted a comprehensive strategy to address occupational stress. The key elements of this strategy are stress prevention, improved claims management and an appropriate legislative framework. Prevention is being promoted through various projects that Comcare is running in conjunction with agencies and also through a joint working party on stress established under the Australian Public Service agreement. At the same time, claims management has improved greatly since the establishment in January 1995 of the Stress Claims Management Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These current measures are, and will continue to be, vitally important. However, the third strategic element, namely legislative amendment, cannot be overlooked, because the creation of a culture of care in the workplace will fail if the workers compensation legislation does not reinforce the attempt to make occupational stress a mainstream human resource management issue. Furthermore, whilst the financial pressure upon the scheme has been ameliorated by improved claims management, the cost attached to stress claims arising from management action has grave implications for the future sustainability of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This trend is occurring throughout Australia and, in response, the HWCA report recommends that all jurisdictions limit compensation for stress by providing that stress which arises from reasonable employer action taken in a reasonable manner regarding discipline, non&hyphen;promotion, termination and similar matters of workplace management is not compensable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second important amendment contained in the bill implements this recommendation. It amends the definition of `injury' in the SRC act to provide that compensation is not payable in respect of an injury which arises solely or predominantly out of reasonable managerial or administrative action taken in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8187"> a reasonable manner by the employer in connection with an employee's employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you can see, there is a dual test of reasonableness; that is, for the exclusion to apply, the action must not only be a reasonable type of managerial or administrative action but also have been carried out in a reasonable manner. I emphasise that the phrase `reasonable managerial or administrative action' does not embrace every kind of instruction or action on the part of an employer. The phrase will not generally cover a direction or series of instructions from the employer concerning the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day tasks which an employee performs. Therefore, if an employee suffers stress from an extremely high workload or as a result of the nature of the duties of his or her position, then that employee shall still be entitled to seek compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to make it clear that the amendments are primarily aimed at stress or stress&hyphen;related conditions. They do not affect an employee's rights to compensation for a physical injury which results from a physical aspect of the employee's working environment. What we mean by reasonable managerial or administrative action is typical human resource management, personnel or workplace management action; that is, an action or decision which is in some way related to the structure or functioning of the workplace or concerns the formal relationship between the employer and the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give you some examples, reasonable managerial or administrative action would include action taken in a reasonable manner to reclassify, transfer, demote, discipline, counsel or redeploy an employee, or cease the employee's employment. It would also cover a decision based on reasonable grounds not to promote, reclassify, transfer or grant leave of absence to an employee. Employer action relating to the restructure and reorganisation of the Australian Public Service would also constitute reasonable managerial or administrative action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To summarise, an employee will not be entitled to compensation for stress or a stress&hyphen;related injury which arises from reasonable managerial or administrative action, providing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the action was carried out in a reasonable manner. Once it is established that an action was reasonable, it will then be a question of fact judged by reference to all the circumstances of a particular case as to whether the action was conducted in a reasonable manner. The overall effect of this is to require employers to adopt sound management practices and to deal with employees fairly and honestly in every single case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also contains a number of minor policy and technical amendments to the SRC Act and the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. These relate in the main to the procedure for determining the contribution payable by each department and Commonwealth authority towards the cost of the administration of the acts. In addition, a number of changes are proposed to streamline administrative arrangements and, therefore, increase the efficiency of Comcare's operational functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government considers that the major amendments in this bill reinforce the policy intention of the original architects of the scheme. In so doing, the bill will ensure a fair, efficient and affordable workers compensation system which balances and supports the rights and responsibilities of Commonwealth employers and their employees and which is sustainable for the future without placing an unfair burden on taxpayers. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA>The bill provides for appropriations and the issue of securities to effect Australia's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8188"> membership of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. Honourable members will be aware that MIGA is one of the World Bank institutions. MIGA's purpose is to foster foreign investment in developing countries by providing:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> advisory services to developing member countries on means of encouraging additional foreign investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to join MIGA and to take up the remaining shares allocated to Australia in recent capital increases of the International Finance Corporation and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development signal the government's strong interest in the World Bank and its desire to enhance Australia's relations with the bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Membership of the World Bank institutions benefits Australia in a number of ways. Australia's experience with Papua New Guinea has clearly shown the benefits of World Bank involvement. The World Bank group is able to attach policy conditions to its aid more effectively than can bilateral donors. It has the capacity to establish an effective policy dialogue and to assist in the coordination of development assistance from multiple sources and, therefore, to maximise the development effectiveness of aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Membership of MIGA and other institutions of the World Bank also provides Australian firms with procurement opportunities.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian business has increasingly been interested in Australia becoming a member of MIGA. Some businesses believe they have been disadvantaged in competing for projects supported by MIGA guarantees because Australia has not been a member. In its report to the previous government entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund</EMPHASIS>, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade concluded that the benefits of joining MIGA outweighed the costs, and recommended that Australia join.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Successive Australian governments have supported Australian exporters with their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> export credit risks through the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. MIGA's political risk insurance and other technical and advisory services will complement EFIC's political risk insurance facilities. Membership could allow EFIC to reduce its own exposure to high risk countries and where its exposure in a particular country is already at its limit. EFIC will also be able to use MIGA as a reinsurer and co&hyphen;insurer. MIGA will also insure Australian investors in multinational joint ventures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia will also benefit from MIGA's services in identifying investment opportunities marketed by developing member countries of MIGA. MIGA has advised that it has already received several preliminary applications for MIGA coverage for prospective Australian investments in developing countries. Once Australia is a member, MIGA will be able to process such applications. Membership will provide the additional support necessary to enhance Australian companies' growing trade and investment linkages with developing countries, particularly in the Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the commercial benefits to Australian business, Australia's membership of MIGA will acknowledge the role that MIGA plays in promoting economic development through facilitating private sector investment in developing countries. Since its establishment, MIGA has facilitated more than $US8.5 billion in foreign private investment. Of this, 26 per cent related to host countries in the Asia region including Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget cost of Australia's membership to MIGA will be small. To effect its membership, Australia will subscribe to the 1,713 shares allocated to it. The cost of each share is $US10,820. The total cost is $US18.5 million, or $A24.5 million. Of this amount, 10 per cent&mdash;equivalent to $A2.45 million&mdash;will be paid in cash in a one&hyphen;off payment with a further 10 per cent covered by a promissory note. The remainder of the cost, $A19.6 million, would be on&hyphen;call. The promissory note and the amount on&hyphen;call will be contingent liabilities of the Commonwealth, but are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8189"> subject to call by MIGA only in the event that these amounts are needed to meet its obligations.

<PARA>The Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996 is the second instalment of legislation which will progressively replace Australia's main tax law, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The 1936 act is on the verge of collapsing under the weight of 60 years of constant and largely piecemeal amendment. The rewrite of the income tax laws to make them shorter, clearer and less burdensome is critical to the Australian taxation system. It will reduce compliance and administrative costs and make it easier for business and individual taxpayers to fulfil their obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax law improvement project has been performing the task of restructuring and rewriting the income tax law. This overhaul is vital and establishes a robust legislative framework which can readily absorb any future changes. By making the law much clearer to follow it will also enable an informed debate about future changes to our tax laws. The tax law improvement project team is to be congratulated for the excellent progress it has achieved towards completing this very major undertaking. It has been greatly assisted by the practical insights and commercial expertise of the consultative committee which advises on the project's work. The committee's comments and suggestions have been a valuable asset and the government is most grateful for their dedication.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax law improvement project has pioneered new techniques to make the legislation more user friendly and understandable. These techniques are now being used in other Commonwealth legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first instalment of the new law, the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996, was passed by this House with bipartisan support and is presently waiting consideration by the Senate. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts reviewed that bill in detail concluding that the bill was a significant improvement over the current law, being widely regarded as far easier to read and understand. The government proposes that the joint committee should continue its long&hyphen;standing role in this project by considering the bill and reporting on it by 6 March 1997.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will build on the very sound foundation laid in the first instalment, particularly by the new structure and core provisions. It includes rewrites of the following important rules with general application: assessable and exempt income, deductions, trading stock, depreciation and gifts. Some other rules with more specialised application have also been rewritten and included in the bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, how many of us realise what our flag, the Australian flag, truly represents? Its meaning extends across our history, our culture, our parentage and our heritage. Its image, at some point, has struck powerfully in the minds of so many Australians across generations. It is one of the defining symbols of what it means to be an Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my eyes, and, I am sure, in the eyes of the great majority of my fellow Australians, the prospect of its design being changed at the apparent drop of a political hat or on a political whim is sacrilegious. Members of this chamber, and indeed all Australians: nothing gives me more pleasure than to speak out loudly and proudly in support of our Australian flag, a flag that is bathed in truly noble history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1823, when two military officers were credited with the first recorded attempt to design a national flag for Australia, the first steps towards a nationally recognisable ensign were taken. Significantly, this early design, known as the national colonial flag, featured a stylised representation of the Southern Cross on the Red Cross of St George and included the Union Jack. So began the development and the creation of our Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1851, the Australasian Anti&hyphen;Transportation League flag, which again featured the Southern Cross and the Union Jack, was unfurled. Three years later, in 1854, the Eureka flag was raised by aggrieved goldminers at Bakery Hill in Ballarat. That flag captured the very spirit of protest, and demonstrated the power of flags as symbols within this country. I should also mention the flag of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8191"> the federation movement of the 1880s and 1890s. It gave substance to their slogan: one people, one destiny, one flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that encapsulates the spirit and feeling generated in our community towards the national ensign. Long before Federation, therefore, Australians had come to see the flag as a means by which to express and define their views, ambitions and unity. The point of this brief tour through history is to define the meaning of this flag, and to demonstrate that a defining symbol of the Australian spirit has long existed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1901, the Commonwealth government held a competition to design two flags, one for official and one for naval purposes. Almost 33,000 entries from around the world were received, with five entrants sharing the prize money of &pound;200 for similar designs. Final approval was given in 1902 for the selected flag, which contained the Union Jack, a Federation Star and the Southern Cross on a blue background, and which was known as the blue ensign. The design selected for the navy was known as the red ensign and was identical in every way except for the red background. Since 1903 the Australian national flag has remained unchanged, with one exception, being the addition in 1908 of a seventh point on the Commonwealth Star to symbolise the Commonwealth territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And so I believe, given the importance of maintaining a nationally acceptable flag, that legislation should match community will. Quite simply, our national flag should not be changed without reference to the very people that it represents, and I do not think you will get much argument to the contrary out there with the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a good part of this century the national flag, in its unchanged form, has represented our society. Blood, sweat and tears have flowed for it. It has adorned the caskets of soldiers who fell tragically in the line of fire. It has flown proudly at the United Nations. Earlier this year, it billowed proudly at Atlanta at both the modern Olympic Games and the paralympics, showing the world that Australia was indeed there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The previous Labor government made it quite clear that they were in favour of chan ging the flag and raised the issue on a number of occasions. Indeed, the debate about the Australian flag was raised to the top of the flagpole as the republic debate took off at full speed just prior to the 1993 election. `Change the government, not the flag' bumper stickers on many cars bellowed, and the chattering of many Labor members' teeth at the thought of it quickly lowered the debate to half mast as opinion poll upon opinion poll and overriding public sentiment indicated and vindicated support for the maintenance of the current flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal coalition, through this hard&hyphen;headed approach by the Labor Party, had recognised the real agenda behind the debate, and on several occasions attempted to introduce flag amendment bills requiring a plebiscite to change the flag. In government, our actions will match these sentimental words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Australia Day this year&mdash;a day most appropriate to putting this issue on the table and taking the political dithering and diatribe out of the debate to change the flag at a whim&mdash;the commitment was placed on the table to amend the Flags Act by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), a leader truly patriotic to his country, his people and his flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The average person was clearly aggrieved that the kite&hyphen;flying to change or question the value of the flag should be allowed to go on unabated, and there was a real fear that it could be changed without their say. The former Prime Minister thrust history lesson after history lesson down our throats over the flag. His understanding of history, and a lot of his political beliefs, needed boning up. It is little wonder that people viewed any hint of a change to the flag with the greatest fear and trepidation. Back then, as now, there simply was no overwhelming support to change our flag from its current form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody can deny the people's right to voice an opinion, least of all me, but change needs more than the views of one small group or launching a spurious debate and airing arguments all for political expedience. That is what this legislation will bring about&mdash;keeping the goodwill of a nation over its national symbols.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8192">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A case in point is the principally noble argument that our fellow Australians fought and died under the Australian national flag at war. The actual fact that this is not quite the case is a moot point, but the fact that such a public misnomer could be a simple catalyst to open up the possible political moves to change the flag without a vote by the people is just a critical reason for this legislation. The fact is the national flag was flown and seen during both world wars and, in addition, Australian servicemen would often see the Union Jack and the flags of our allies. There is no doubt whatsoever that Australians in the main served under their own national flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australians who did fight and die under the Australian national flag, however, were those Australian military personnel who went to Korea, Malaysia, Borneo and South Vietnam. Further, the welcome home parade for our veterans in Sydney just a few years ago with over 500 Australian flags leading the march reinforced the point. The Australian flag was held in very high esteem by our diggers serving over there and to tell them that this flag could be changed by `a good political idea at the time' should not be allowed, and indeed would not be accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year, as we commemorated the battle of Long Tan where Aussie diggers distinguished themselves in true Anzac tradition, veterans and their families, accompanied by the old guard, like the late Eric Bushel from the East Maitland RSL and Graham Chandler, president of the Vietnam veterans, stood proud while the last post was played. This mark of respect was organised by Neil Chromarty, secretary of the Vietnam veterans service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was held late in the afternoon as the sun was setting. It was a cold, still evening with a lone flagpole flying the Australian flag at half mast. The last post was played intermingled with the soft melody of Waltzing Matilda. The main focus of our attention was on the Australian flag reaching out to its people against a setting sun, releasing emotions of pride and remembrance and, above all, uniting those present with this simple symbol of our nationhood. It is but one reason not to float the idea of change at the whim of a political <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> flash of the wand, given the flash of gunfire and bayonets on the fields of war that provided our democratic freedom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the most critical point in this whole debate is that quite simply and surely the current Australian flag has come to be identified by all Australians as being a credible and very acceptable Australian symbol. To advocate its change will unquestionably need substantial goodwill towards an alternative design, and that goodwill should, if ever deemed acceptable, be derived by a national referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However gutsy a political leader or lobby organisation would be in taking full charge in changing the flag, why leave open the door of opportunity to see the debate hijacked without the full say of the Australian people? To me, those who abide by the saying `if it ain't broke, don't fix it' are missing the point entirely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All our schools fly the Australian flag. Ask our kids what they think about changing the Australian flag. You know the answer as well as I do. They do not associate the flag with any other nation but their own. They regard the Union Jack as a reference to our common language, democratic ideals and political institutions. It should never be up to politicians in this modern day and age, or those with vested interests, to change our national flag. Only the Australian people as a whole should have that right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's proposed amendment to the Flags Act will protect the right of every Australian to one day change the flag but only if they, as a clear majority, see fit and if it is done in a purely democratic manner. Unfortunately, politicians have used the argument to change the flag as a convenient tool to draw our attention away from other greater issues, full well knowing that such a suggestion alone has acted as a powder keg, blowing arguments on other subjects well away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Prime Minister was, of course, a master at this smokescreen of deception. Despite the many innuendos, no real action was undertaken to follow through on his suggestion that the Australian flag should be changed. It is not only the flag that is used in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8193"> this way but also the constitution, the monarchy, our Governor&hyphen;General, state governors, our traditions and our heritage. My God, what will be next?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing that always stands us as Australians apart wherever we may roam is the fact that we come from a free democratic nation with freedom of speech, freedom of ideals and freedom of association. No government should have the right to take away any of these things from the people without reference to the people. This legislation will make that abundantly clear. It is within the fabric of our nation that our strengths and weaknesses lie. Yet, when it comes to an issue as basic as our national flag, no current legislation protects it from being changed without reference to the very people who own it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The moral of this story is in its ending. I speak for the Flags Amendment Bill. The introduction of this bill was an election promise, but it is much more than that. It is a promise to all Australians that the coalition values its heritage and its values as a democratic country, the land of the free. It is a promise and a commitment for all of us. Democracy is embodied by the famous quote from an even more famous person, Abraham Lincoln, who advocated: `From the people, for the people, by the people.' Surely an issue as important as the future of our national symbol, our national heritage and our national pride should be left to the Australian people to decide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian national flag belongs to the Australian people and has been identified with the Australian people since Federation. It belongs no more to me than it does to any other citizen of this great nation. So my influence should be no more if, or should, our flag be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flag of the Australian people should only be changed by the Australian people. Again, it is important to remember the battle cry: one people, one destiny, one flag. I commend this bill to the House on behalf of all proud Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I found that to be a very interesting contribution by the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> perhaps more interesting for what he did not say than for what he did. As I have got older the symbol of our nation&mdash;the flag&mdash;has meant more and more to me, so I take this debate very seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think at the outset what we have to do is say that this is a bit of legislation and, like any bit of legislation, it can be amended. In fact this legislation amends the 1953 legislation brought in by Mr Menzies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it was interesting that, when going over the history of the flag, the member for Paterson talked about the competition and the fact that the blue ensign was finally selected in 1902 to become the official and navy flag. In 1903 we got the red ensign, which was for the merchant navy, the only difference being the red background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From that period until 1953, there was a degree of confusion about what constituted Australia's national flag. The 1953 legislation was enacted and clearly said that the blue ensign was going to be our flag. So having a clearly defined national flag in our settled history of almost 200 years&mdash;ignoring the earlier history&mdash;has only happened in the last 43 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found it amusing to learn that the 1953 legislation&mdash;lest we offend people&mdash;preserved the right and privilege of people to fly the Union Jack, presumably as a symbol of Australia. I am looking forward to hearing whether other government speakers feel that this right enshrined in the 1953 legislation, and untouched by this amendment bill, is something that they fully support as reflecting a symbol of our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had earlier developed a private member's bill, so greatly do I feel the flag is a symbol of our nation. My private member's bill prevented the burning or defacing of the Australian flag, but I regret that circumstances prevented me from proceeding with that bill. On my side of the House, a lot of people would probably object very vigorously to that provision, so great do they hold this democracy of ours in Australia. They believe that people have an inalienable right to protest and that a test of that protest even comes when symbols of our country are damaged in that way, and I have some sympathy for that view. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8194"> When we start beating our breasts about the quality of our democracy, we ought to lay down some of the tests of that democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you walk into my electorate office, you will notice a few things as you go through the door. The first is an Australian flag. It has only been of recent times&mdash;in the last couple of years, I think&mdash;that I have had alongside the Australian flag another official flag, the Aboriginal flag. I must say that I am very proud to see it there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have what I believe to be a great photo of the Kibeho refugee camp in Rwanda. You can see me and the then deputy high commissioner for Nairobi&mdash;and I apologise because I have forgotten her name&mdash;and we are surrounded by thousands of kids. The purpose of my visit to Rwanda was to see Australian peacekeepers in action, and I considered it to be a great privilege to be there with a number of other members of the House, including the Speaker, and some senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The photo is a stark reminder to me that there was a subsequent massacre at that camp, with some 5,000 killed. It is highly likely that some of those children seen in that photograph were killed during the massacre, although I have no way of telling. When I have been to Rwanda and seen on the ground what our people have done and I have seen the Australian flag, I get a real buzz out of it. I must say that the same happens for me when visiting our peacekeepers in Somalia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, when we talk about the importance of the flag in terms of our defence forces, we need to make the point that during the Second World War the likelihood was that our soldiers who died in battle probably did not have the blue ensign or the Australian flag flown. It is likely that the Union Jack or another allied flag was flown, rather than our own national flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate very much that there are a lot of Australians who feel very strongly about preserving our current flag, but I want to be perfectly frank with the House and perfectly frank with the people of my electorate. I get embarrassed when I am overseas and people fly the New Zealand flag thinking it is the Australian flag. As some people confessed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> after Atlanta, they were embarrassed when the Australian and New Zealand flags were flown side by side and it was so difficult to detect the difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are approaching the 200th year of our federation and a new millennium, I would like to see something that is uniquely Australian so that there is no confusion about whether this is a colony of the UK and so that it cannot be confused with New Zealand and/or some other former colony. My own preference in fact is to replace the Union Jack with the centrepiece of the Aboriginal flag. The attraction for me is this: the Aboriginal Australians were the first Australians. All subsequent Australians have come to this land. I believe it recognises their unique and special role in our society, and, of course, it gives the flag a unique character. It also preserves the stars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people will say, `Look, this is just an anti&hyphen;British thing. You want to get the Union Jack out of your flag because you're anti-United Kingdom.' I always say that England provided so much to our society. It is woven into the fabric of our society. No matter how bloody&hyphen;minded you are, you will not eliminate it. That is our history. That is something that we should cherish, and I do. But we are, after all, an independent nation now. Hopefully, the government will contemplate Australia becoming a republic and make that abundantly clear and avoid the current confusion. So I think it is appropriate for us to look at a new flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of my pleasures in life to go around to the schools in my area presenting flags. I like to talk about my overseas experience. I like to talk about our flag being the symbol of our nation. I suppose I had better get a disclaimer officially on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record. There is no truth in a rumour that is going around my electorate that I am secretly employing a gang of teenagers to knock off school flags to give myself an opportunity to re-present flags to the schools. There is absolutely no truth to that. I officially deny it here, and I do so on every occasion. But I am never displeased to be at a school and talking to the young school children about our flag, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8195"> my experiences and what I think it should symbolise for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, in a changing society, schools are so radically different. In my day, if someone presented a flag to a school, you would have done it to the principal. The students would have had absolutely no part in the ceremony. These days&mdash;and it matters not whether you go to a primary or a high school&mdash;you are more than likely to be welcomed and introduced at the microphone by a student, usually the captain, and you present the flag to the students. I think this is a wonderful change in roles and relationships at schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people that we present the flag to&mdash;the primary school students and the high school students&mdash;are the future of our nation. I regret to say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you and I are probably not going to have too much influence beyond this millennium. It is those people who are going to decide. Wouldn't it be really nice in the year 2000, when we are going to have the Olympics in Australia&mdash;I see the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) has entered the chamber&mdash;if we had a flag that was uniquely and distinctly Australian so that, in that context between Mother England, New Zealand and Australia, when the flags rise as they do to herald the winner, the second place&hyphen;getter and the third place&hyphen;getter, there would be no confusion in that huge audience worldwide that Australia has won or Australia has come second or Australia has come third.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about the symbol of our country, I would like to think that, as we approach the year 2000, we might try to balance that Aussie tendency of knocking off tall poppies to give people a fair go and being a little self&hyphen;deprecating and display to all those who come to Australia something that I think Australians have, that is, a great love of our country, and perhaps be a little bit more open in expressing that and be a little bit more patriotic. But you cannot legislate for that. This is the point I want to make. You really cannot legislate for that. I do not think this bill is particularly helpful at all. Probably, I am going to be sharing quite a bit more with government speakers than perhaps with some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> others, but I do not think this particular bill is the way to go about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, I do not think the government is particularly serious about the bill. I can say to the people in the galleries that in the last week what the House of Representatives is all about is being positioned to receive bills coming back from the Senate. The government looks around to find bills or opportunities which are, effectively, fillers. If you look at the speakers list, and note that this is coming up again in the last week of the sitting, you would have to say that this is being used as a filler and that, in fact, they are not being particularly serious about the bill. I regret that because I think it is an important opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was talking earlier about the flag being the symbol of our country, patriotism and the quality of our democracy. When people make speeches about the flag, it is fair enough to talk  about those who have sacrificed their lives. I might say on that that I am one who says that, when we ask people to put their lives on the line for this country, as we do with serving men and women, we ought to make sure that they very much understand what it is that they are trying to preserve&mdash;what is this Australian way of life and what is our Australian parliamentary system, our Australian executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, I do not think we do enough of that. When HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba</EMPHASIS> was still open, I was pleased to bring cadets down here for the first time to wander around parliament, meet a few people and actually touch one of the institutions they are charged with defending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quality of our democracy has to be such that we allow criticism, we allow people to voice their views, and sometimes in a way that might offend us. That is an important test of a democracy. The other test is the extent to which we are prepared to care and be concerned about the weakest in our society, particularly when it is perhaps very unfashionable and politically incorrect to do so. That is also an important quality of democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am tempted to talk about some of the churches. I realise I am committing one of those cardinal sins in mixing politics and religion. If you look at the mission statement <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8196"> of the churches, you will see that they will not argue they are really about the poorest in our society, not the wealthiest and best off. They have also have the dilemma of wanting to reflect their active membership, and that can become a conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about the quality of our Australian democracy and the quality of our nation, let us be very proud of it. I certainly am. The more I go overseas, the prouder I am. But it also means that we have responsibilities. The quality of this Australian democracy is to speak up for the weakest, for those that cannot speak on behalf of themselves, for the powerless in our society. They are not always being championed. Sometimes when they seek to express themselves they are turned on.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key ingredient of our democracy is tolerance. It is true that united we stand but we ought not to go for the lowest common denominator. Being united means embracing all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least&mdash;I want to finish on this note&mdash;when I see the Australian flag it is the symbol of our country. We are one nation. I am pleased to say we are one nation with many cultures&mdash;the original culture of this land, the Aboriginal culture, and all the successive waves of migrants that have come and continue to come. Whether people come from the United Kingdom or Ireland or New Zealand or Southern Europe or Asia, part of that rich texture of our nation is this diversity. So, yes, Australia first, but an Australia and Australians from different cultures and backgrounds. I have been pleased to speak on this bill. I note that when the issue first came up I was overseas and did not have the opportunity to speak on it.</PARA></SPEECH>

He makes the point, for instance, that he might like to introduce a little of the so&hyphen;called&mdash;and I underline those words&mdash;Aboriginal flag as part of the design of a new flag. He quite correctly states that the Aborigines were the original inhabitants of this continent, this geographic area; but, furthermore, he infers that their cultural significance should be recognised in our flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made the point before that one of the great aberrations of the Aboriginal movement is their choosing to design a flag. A flag had no place in Aboriginal culture until the arrival of Europeans, and until quite recent times Aboriginal people never paraded, never fought and never did anything with a flag. It has been a clever device to attract the interest of the Europeans and those other sectors of Australia's diverse community today where a flag, a banner and those sorts of trappings are institutionalised. There never was an Aboriginal flag at the tribal, state or nationhood level, and it is a prostitution of their culture to put so much concentration on it today. I find it quite repulsive to see two gentlemen, the Dodson brothers, come into this parliament wearing Akubra hats as evidence of their Aboriginality when Aboriginal people never ever wore hats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not part of their culture. It is just a case of very smart people using symbolism that is associated with European culture to somehow create an image in the European mind of what is Aboriginal culture. They are entitled to their culture; they are entitled to respect it. I just suggest they practise it. To suggest that an Aboriginal flag is part of Aboriginal culture cannot be substantiated by history. They never had one, and that is a fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the more we deal with Aboriginal and our own circumstances by looking at the facts of history, the better off this country will be. We have been through an era in more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8197"> recent times when, day after day, there has been a deliberate campaign of re&hyphen;writing Australia's history, refusing to recognise what occurred in history, refusing to recognise the brutality that was commonplace in years gone by, and refusing to recognise the tragedy of brutality that still exists in many parts of the world. It is plainly ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian flag is what it is&mdash;it was created at the birth of this nation as a whole. It was a design submitted to a competition and it was accepted by the people. It could have been pink with purple polka dots as far as I am concerned. Fortunately, it is not. The member for Chifley complained about its similarity to the New Zealand flag. That is an unfortunate accident of history. It is not a problem for me. The reality is they are two of the most attractively designed flags that exist around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that we should have something that is uniquely Australian. Such a flag got international recognition not too many years ago. I refer to the yellow boxing kangaroo on a green background. Would anybody want to replace our flag with that design? I doubt it. You could not say that it was not uniquely Australian; it was just a bit crass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that when nations set out to redesign their flags&mdash;and I remind people to look outside this place on special occasions when flags are flown in great numbers&mdash;very few of them would reach the standards of attractiveness of the Australian flag in a fit. In fact, traditionally, other flags consist of a choice of two or three stripes of colour&mdash;no design, nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Canadians decided that they needed a unique identity so they chose a red flag with a white maple leaf in the middle of it which looks like a school kid drew it. Would anybody suggest that that flag is a much better design than the one they had before? In pure design terms, it is very unattractive and very pedestrian. I do not want to pick on the poor old Canadians, but it is an example of how these people can say there is always something better in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My great problem with these attacks on the design of the flag is that they reflect an attack on our constitutional status&mdash;and I use those <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> words advisedly, rather than the emotional reference to a republic and some sort of freedom we are supposed to get that we do not have now. But we ignore the risks, and I will come back to that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that we now have an orchestrated campaign of attacks on our established institutions. It is part of a deliberate campaign to denigrate our history, to suggest that there was something wrong with us, that we should apologise to the world because we are here. I say that Australia is outstanding throughout the entire world in terms of the achievements of two centuries compared to those of tens of thousands of years. I refer to the achievements of two centuries in terms of the development of this country and, more particularly, the establishment of democratic institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can look with pride at 200 years, practically&mdash;certainly 150&mdash;of absolute democracy. Traditionally, very few parts of the world today can claim that record. Why is it necessary to change the symbol that is totally associated with that democratic process? We have had absolute democracy from the day on which that design was approved. If we check what has happened in other parts of the world, some of those that have changed their flags change them every time they get democracy for a while. Does that improve them? Of course not. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, there is an undercurrent in all of this. It is a process of trying to tell Australians there is something wrong with them. I am pleased to say that when this bill is passed the message that politicians or these activists will get from the Australian people, should they choose to change the design of this flag, is that the Australian people do not concur with that view. They are proud of their achievements. They are anxious for the future of their children. In fact, they do not want us wasting our time on these peripheral issues. These are the fundamental points of what we are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to design, by international comparison our flag is very attractive. You can tell me that it has `the Union Jack in the corner'. I have never perceived it to be the Union Jack. I have never perceived it to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8198"> some aspect of bending one knee and knuckling one's forehead to another country because there is a design in the corner of our flag that has similarities to another flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamentally, it consists of a number of religious crosses. Why not tell the Vatican to change their flag because some aspect of their religious status might be recognised? To me, it is part of the design of the flag. It represents no more, and it adds to the attractiveness of the flag because the colour scheme is brilliant and the reference to the stars is great. The member for Chifley apparently thinks that if we have the sun and the stars on the flag, things will be better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Chifley took that view because he now suffers from the myth that Aboriginals always had a flag, that they went out spearing each other carrying that flag with the sun on it, when of course they did not. They never had a flag. They are one of the few people, even indigenous, that did not practise within their culture the possession or recognition of a flag. Yet we have had debates all over the place about this and we have had athletes running around stadiums with something that is foreign to their culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what do we have to do? We are told by the member for Chifley that we need something by the year 2000. I find no significance in the year 2000 that says we should change our established institutions&mdash;none whatsoever. It is another date and it happens to be when we will host the Olympic Games. When we want to make changes in this country, I do not care if they are made in 1996 or 2006.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expect changes made in this parliament to add to the prosperity of our people in a sensible way. I expect those changes to address poverty. I expect those changes to lift our international profile by sporting achievement, by diplomatic achievement and by assisting Third World nations&mdash;not by changing our flag. If anybody thinks changing our flag will have a great international diplomatic effect, they are kidding themselves because the world could not care less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is like some of the other debates that are going on about trade, et cetera. There are three questions in international trade: how good, how soon and how much. Once they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been satisfied&mdash;unfortunately, Australia has some difficulty with that in this day and age&mdash;then of course the business is done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will take some of the time left to me to look at this process of denigration of our past which has been practised by so many. It has been done in politics. When I sat in the opposition benches I used to yell out, `Why didn't you blame Billy Hughes when he was a Liberal?' Of course, everything of the past was wrong, but only if you were a Liberal. The facts are there. A fair bit of Aboriginal history has been recorded over the last 200 years and it should be regarded as such, not as people now wish to redefine it. The same applies to the redesign of our flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we are trying to do by this is say that there is something wrong with the people of the past. The people of the past successfully did something that this generation that wants to get into all of this second level debate, those of us sitting in this room at the moment, failed to do. As Australians, the people of the past all delivered a higher living standard to their children than their parents had delivered to them, and we stand here condemned as the first generation that has failed to do that, because we got too greedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We wanted too much for ourselves and we have had a series of governments that were prepared to provide it on the grounds that it enhanced their chances of re-election&mdash;more particularly over the last 13 years when $80,000 million of our kids' money was borrowed and spent to keep us happy. And we think we should be wasting time debating whether the flag that those great people before us designed has something wrong with it. Of course there is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same applies when we get to this great push to change the image of Australia by calling ourselves a republic. To be quite honest, I do not care what you call us, provided the process does not interfere with the democratic protection that I have today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody who starts to fiddle with and change the Australian constitution raises one great difficulty, which has become another aspect of contemporary Australia. We make the changes and then the High Court tells us what we have done. If we interfere with our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8199"> current structures in the constitution, there can be no guarantee to Australians that what they thought they were approving will in fact eventually be that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The structures are quite simple. You and I know the process of changing our constitution, and this miracle of republicanism, even the minimalist process, requires substantial change to the constitution. Everybody is starting to worry about how much power this new person whom we would call El Presidente might get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that you first pass a constitution amendment bill in this place. Anybody that suggests that the legislation passed in this place is always certain in its outcome should check the records of the High Court. So we pass a bill and we call a referendum. Then we have an obligation to advise the people of what the votes they cast will mean. In other words, what does our legislation mean? We do not get the High Court to write that letter; that is written by selected politicians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only time I have voted yes in a constitutional referendum was the one related to giving the Commonwealth power on Aboriginal matters. It is an interesting point because I did so on the advice I received under that process. I keep a copy to remind me never to vote yes again, because that advice told me that the Commonwealth had no intention of overriding the states in their responsibilities to Aboriginal people, that it was only seeking the power so that `together' the Commonwealth and the states could go forward in advancing the welfare of Aboriginal people. They used words like `cooperation'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened? When my vote was tested in the High Court, they told me that the politician had lied to me. He had misled me. There was no obligation on the Commonwealth to cooperate with state governments. There was no obligation on the Commonwealth to consult state governments. And they did not. We have seen the end point of that with this stupid native title legislation, which is costing millions of dollars in legal fees and is going nowhere. That is how it works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Australians get conned into this argument that we have got to be free of the United Kingdom&mdash;as though the prime <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ministers of Australia ring the Queen up every day and say, `Please, Miss, can I leave the room?' They never do. There is no intrusion into our political processes and democratic structures emanating from our current arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, when we look at the ultimate power of the `Crown', which is the sacking of a parliament, under our constitution it is done by the Governor&hyphen;General&mdash;they are the words used&mdash;not by the Queen. There are possibly one or two people in this place who still remember the last time a Governor&hyphen;General did that. And he sacked the government that appointed him.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The realities are that we have no intrusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not mind what you do about that, but I do mind when you set out to change the constitution and I have to put myself in the position of being like someone told to run across a freeway with a paper bag over their head&mdash;because I do not know what happens. I cannot be guaranteed that the legislation on which I will be asked to vote yes or no will in fact have the effect that has been promised by the politicians. The High Court traditionally, of course, will change that or tell us what their view is only after it has been enacted. They do not give advisory opinions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is what we are confronted with on this whole issue. I repeat: it is all unnecessary; it is all costly; there are better ways to spend the money; there are better ways to spend our time in this parliament; and, worse, it is a campaign to denigrate our history, of which I am extremely proud.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even when and if this Flags Amendment Bill is passed, it would offer the Australian flag no real protection. This bill attempts to ensure the Australian national flag cannot be changed except by a vote of a majority of state and territory electors. However, the amendments proposed here could be repealed or replaced in the normal way by the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If enacted, this bill could not legally bind a future government, and there is a division of legal opinion as to whether in fact the Flags Amendment Bill 1996 is unconstitutional because it seeks to invest legislative power in the people, who are not recognised as part <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8200"> of the legislative arm of the Commonwealth in the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another body of opinion suggests the bill may not be unconstitutional because it merely limits delegation of legislative power to an alternative legislature made up of the Queen, the Senate, the House of Representatives and, outside the Commonwealth legislative power, the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is admirable that the people of Australia are included in any debate on the flag of this nation, one must ask why the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) feels it necessary to give the current flag such protection. If most Australians were proud of the flag and felt it appropriate and representative of this country in the l990s, then there would be no need to protect it. The recent Olympic Games in Atlanta showed how confusing our national emblem is when it was hoisted alongside the New Zealand flag in a medals ceremony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any debate over a republic in this country must also include debate on our constitution, federation, and our national symbols, including flag and perhaps anthem. There is division within our multicultural society about the symbols that best represent us heading into the next century. I too am part of a multicultural heritage that goes back to Swedish grandfathers. While I am among the first to say the flag has served us well throughout this century, I am aware that there are strong feelings within the community that the current national flag does not represent all the roots, all the aspirations, now represented within our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often said that the national flag should not change because Australians have fought and died under it in the wars of this century. But which flag are we talking about? Our forces have in fact fought under a variety of ensigns, including the British Royal Air Force flag, the British navy  ensign, the Union Jack and both Australian red and blue ensigns. Rather than single out the current flag for special protection, we should be preparing to debate the pros and cons of our current flag and constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent people's convention in Bathurst, part of which I attended, drew up a series of recommendations, handed to the Attorney&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> General (Mr Williams), calling for a people's convention next year to discuss the constitution. This event mirrored one in Bathurst exactly 100 years ago that was organised by locals frustrated at the slow rate of progress towards federation. I am glad to see that the government has responded to similar frustration in the community about the slowness of moves to debate the centenary of Federation and what, if any, changes should occur to our constitution and our head of state and whether we should remain a constitutional monarchy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I believe a plebiscite before any national convention is necessary so we know the extent of support&mdash;one way or the other&mdash;for changes to our constitution. I have grave doubts about a national convention. With some appointed and some by some means elected, it is fraught with dangers that could cause divisions rather than reach any consensus on a future constitutional path. I believe we must respect the feelings and loyalties of those generations for whom the monarchy and flag have meant so much. But just as we now have our national anthem, so too must we move on eventually as a nation from puberty to adulthood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not realise the starkness of Australia's position in this regard until I received this document from Ausflag, with an accompanying note from board member, Nick Greiner. The document is labelled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Growing Up</EMPHASIS> and it details the flags of several nations, including the United States, India, Malaysia, Canada, Solomon Islands, Ireland, Ghana, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea and South Africa. It shows the former flags. For instance: `United States. Colonised 1607.' And, in the words of Ausflag: `Grew up: 1776.' That was when the United Kingdom's ensign disappeared essentially from the national flag. So it was with Malaysia, India and right through. But there at the bottom: `Australia. Colonised 1788. Grew up: ?.' That essentially is the position we are in heading into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8201"> Now that we are debating the multicultural basis of this country and how proud we are of those new arrivals in our country, we must be taking on board the sorts of sentiments that are out there about the need, if not to change, to at least talk about the change and demo cratically&mdash;if that be the wish&mdash;look seriously at it, because as a nation we are being left very far behind in terms of our national identity symbols.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such a national convention, after a national plebiscite, should also consider the national flag. It should also consider that the wish by Cathy Freeman to embrace the Aboriginal flag is no less an expression of patriotism than our sailors fighting under the British navy ensign at various stages during World War II or Sydney Marconi soccer players having Italian national colours in their insignia. I wish we could discuss the possibility of including all our ethnic derivatives within a new flag at the same time we discuss the form a republic might take. That perhaps is impossible, given our rich and various ethnic mix.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another emerging anachronism for our national symbols is that before too long we and New Zealand will be the only countries with the Queen's portrait on our currency. Britain itself will lose that distinction with the Eurodollar. The current blue Australian flag is but one of several Australian flags. There is the Australian white ensign, the Royal Australian Air Force ensign, the Aboriginal flag and the Torres Strait Islander flag. Under section 5 of the Flags Act, the Governor&hyphen;General may, by proclamation, appoint such other flags and ensigns as he or she sees fit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have more than 20 other official flags: Customs, Norfolk Island, state and state governors, the Northern Territory, the ACT, the Governor&hyphen;General's flag and the Queen's personal flag. So don't let us question Cathy Freeman's right to celebrate her Aboriginality through her people's flag which is within the nation. She is not questioning, and no&hyphen;one should question, her commitment to Australia. Would we question Laurie Daly running a lap of Suncorp Stadium with the state flag should he win the State of Origin match?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and the Prime Minister can choose to ignore these issues, and no doubt he would be in step with many of his supporters in Bennelong and in the neighbouring seats of Warringah and Mackellar across Sydney's North Shore. And I admit there would be strong support for the status quo within my electorate. But, as one moves about this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country, you realise there is a significant part of Australia out there which, while respecting the tradition of the ties with the monarch, certainly does not share the same enthusiasm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most Australians realise we have moved on from the 1950s when Prime Minister Menzies officially endorsed the blue ensign as our official flag. Most Australians realise the time has come to, at the very least, take a good hard look at our symbols and whether they are representative of Australia today and as we head into the new century. Putting your head in the sand and ignoring it will not make these issues go away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislation&mdash;such as this bill heralds&mdash;is not the way to go. I really wonder why there is such urgency to get this bill through. Was a similar bill introduced to protect our national anthem prior to the 1977 referendum on a new national song?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Passing a flags bill will not result in any surge in public support and enthusiasm for the existing flag if people do not believe the existing design is appropriate to Australia today. I do not really see the need in declaring 3 September national flag day unless it was specifically designed to cement the current flag in the national psyche. At a time we are debating our symbols and our constitution, it does not seem to me there is any great imperative for this bill. No doubt we are very proud of our flag and love it. But is it our flag of tomorrow and next century? Is it one that the majority of young people of Australia today take great pride in?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well for the members of this House to sit here and pass judgment. But, let's face it, the majority of us are white Anglo&hyphen;Saxon and approaching or well over the age of 40&mdash;typical but hardly representative for a House of Representatives. And that is with due regard to some of our younger members in the House at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again you can ignore reality and pretend all your life, but the fact is many Australians want to have a say on this and many other issues that determine our national identity. They deserve to have their say and not have us sit here and make such important decisions for them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8202">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When would we hold a flag referendum? With the next general election? It would completely cloud a fair assessment of the election issues. Is this the government's intent? To obfuscate the election debate by dragging a red herring through the election campaign perhaps? The flag referendum would become a party political debate when it warrants a far more considered investigation&mdash;and an independent referendum or plebiscite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his explanatory memorandum to this bill the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) says the purpose of this bill is to amend the Flags Act. When it comes to the crunch, you have to ask why it is necessary to pass such a bill in the first place. Can you imagine the Americans feeling it necessary to protect the Star&hyphen;Spangled Banner? Would the French feel it necessary to enshrine the Tricolour in legislation? Even among our fellow Commonwealth nations, look at the pride the Canadians have in their maple leaf and look at how South Africa has so enthusiastically embraced the nation's new multicultural flag&mdash;and its new constitution just yesterday in Sharpeville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Really there is only one part of our flag that I consider would unite a majority of Australians today. One aspect that people would really be prepared to fight for, that is a recognised symbol of this southern continent and that stirs patriotism and pride in the nation is the Southern Cross. Perhaps this is the symbol we should be protecting and using as a basis for a new flag for this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite simply, the Flags Amendment Bill is an unnecessary waste of time that is out of step with national thinking. At last reports I saw that about 60 per cent want a new symbol. We should not hide from that fact; we should openly debate it. Even if it is passed, this bill will have no real power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we head towards the centenary of Federation and with so many Australians now keen for this nation to become a republic, it is time we reviewed all the symbols and structures that define us as a nation&mdash;not in a piecemeal fashion but in a considered, cooperative manner. I am certainly not an advocate for changing everything, but there <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comes an appropriate time when it is worth reviewing the symbols that identify us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again we have seen in South Africa how, by acting at the appropriate time and taking the appropriate measures, governments showing real vision and leadership can help redefine and unite a nation, at the same time lifting its standing in the world order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time this parliament took a similar bold stand rather than simply fiddle about the edges with a bill like this. Our gold medallists from Atlanta are in majority in favour of a new flag&mdash;embracing elements of the existing one perhaps but wanting change. They are overwhelmingly in favour of retaining our anthem. These are the sentiments out there among our young as we head into the new century&mdash;as we approach Sydney 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us embrace that feeling of our young, while we respect the views of the older residents, but let us not fiddle around the edges and hang on too long. In my former game&mdash;journalism&mdash;one had to update sometimes on an hourly basis. It is time for an update. I do not perhaps feel the passion for change as do others in the community, but I must accept that it is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not be locked into an era that has changed; let us open up the debate and review our symbols, including the flag. Sure, we should allow the people of Australia to decide, but let us not be too cute by half and put up pious legislation that, to quote from the minister's second reading speech, `provi&hyphen;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8203">
<PARA>des the people of Australia with a guarantee that they will decide if their national flag should be changed'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no conspiracy afoot to change the flag by stealth, but there is a majority feeling out there that change should be made&mdash;and that should be tested the sooner the better. The second reading speech is wrapped in motherhood statements with which no-one has a problem. I ask: what is the purpose of this bill? Of course the flag should not be changed without a popular vote. But let us get our priorities right. Let us test the poll-evidenced climate for change of constitution, flag and head of state by taking all to a plebiscite, and then settle down to a convention on all these issues in one debate&mdash;not swim against the tide of public sentiment as this bill suggests. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like a copy of this document included in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to illustrate the point I was making during the debate.

<PARA>I think that pretty well sums up how so many people in Australia feel about the current Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Flags Amendment Bill that we are considering at the moment is the Howard government keeping its election promise to make the Australian flag much harder to change. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) originally announced this legislative amendment, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) immediately announced Labor would not oppose this legislation&mdash;even though for more than a decade now Labor have persistently done so. At the same time, a spokeswoman for the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot, said the Democrats retained an open mind on the need for a referendum on this matter.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8205">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would think that the Labor Party should be mindful of why their recent primary vote fell to its lowest level since 1913. The former Prime Minister's penchant for changing Australian icons is, I am sure, just another reason why the Australian people turned against the ALP on 2 March. I trust the Democrats hear the same message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In researching today's speech, I believe I have unearthed a conspiracy against Queensland that involves New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware that I represent Townsville, the capital city of North Queensland, and I have previously told this House of the importance of Townsville. So it will not surprise you when I tell you that the Australian flag was first flown in Flinders Street, Townsville, North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time the result of a competition for an Australian flag was announced. The then Governor-General, the Rt Hon. John Hope&mdash;the Earl of Hopetoun&mdash;was touring the north and was in Townsville. An enterprising Townsville sailmaker, William McKenzie, immediately produced the flag and the Governor-General accepted an invitation to fly the flag for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, for the first part of this conspiracy, enter the Victorians. I am advised that history shows that the Victorians heard about what was to happen in Townsville and they too made up a flag in Melbourne. They invited the Governor-General's wife to fly the flag a day earlier. However, this had no official status and under flag protocol at the time the Governor-General's wife was not recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, for the second part of the conspiracy, enter the New South Welshmen. In 1922 a request was received from the national museum, then located in Sydney. They asked Townsville to send Australia's first flag to their museum. The local Townsville council, in the national interest, decided to relinquish custodianship of this piece of history. The flag was duly forwarded to Sydney. Sadly, I report it has never been seen again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now enter the Australian Capital Territory. The Commonwealth's own publication on the Australian national flag wrongly claims that the flag was first flown on the Exhibition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Building in Melbourne. This was despite research by the eminent Rt Hon. Sir Ninian Stephen, who clearly gives credit to Townsville as the first city in Australia to fly the Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Returned Services League clubs in Townsville, Thuringowa and Magnetic Island regions have made it very clear to me&mdash;as I am sure RSL clubs have to members throughout Australia&mdash;that they object strongly to any changes to the Australian national flag. The Secretary of the Magnetic Island RSL, Mr Rae Dalliston, said in a letter to me earlier this month:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A motion was moved, seconded and passed by all members present to `. . . not support any change to our National Flag in any way'.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dalliston went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As most of our members have served Australia in all wars since the inception of our National Flag, and in peace keeping duties throughout the world, I feel sure each and every one of us felt very proud of the flag we served under.</PARA>
<PARA>I have also received a similar response from the secretary of the Townsville RSL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was on Anzac Day of this year that the Prime Minister reaffirmed this government's commitment to all Australians that they would be consulted in the form of a referendum or plebiscite before any changes to the national flag are made. Anzac Day is the most important day of the year for RSLs throughout Australia. It is an important day for all Australians, but especially for our veterans and our Defence Force personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This House has heard in the past from a number of members on this issue and on whether or not the Australian flag should be changed. Many have harked back to the days of World War I&mdash;in particular, Gallipoli&mdash;because those days were defining moments for Australia in terms of our national identity. Each year hundreds of Australians, many of them young backpackers, travel to Gallipoli to commemorate the occasion, to visit the historical sites, to walk the old trenches and to pray and reflect on what took place there so many years ago. In recent years we have seen attendances at Anzac Day marches and dawn services grow even stronger. That <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8206"> growth has been predominantly from within the ranks of Australia's youth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But just as we are a nation beginning to look afresh at our own history&mdash;last year's VP 50 celebrations, which originated from Townsville, were a great example of that&mdash;we should also remember that Australian personnel have also been involved in more recent theatres of conflict. While healthy debate will continue as to which flag our Anzac soldiers saw and fought the most under&mdash;the British Union Jack or the Australian blue ensign&mdash;there is no doubt which flag Australia's recent peacekeeping contributions in places such as Cambodia, Somalia, Rwanda and the Gulf were conducted under on behalf of the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, Australian defence personnel from 1 Battalion served in Baidoa, Somalia, as part of a United Nations humanitarian mission. When the Australians arrived in Baidoa, they arrived in a town that had ceased to function and where people were literally dying in the streets. After years of civil war the government of Somalia had collapsed and with it all sense of organised infrastructure. There were no hospitals, no police force and no legal system. Armed gangs of bandits roamed throughout the cities and country. Villages were attacked and destroyed for their food. The 1 Battalion were given command of an area of operation of some 18,000 square kilometres to secure. They did it in a wonderful way, and there have been some recent awards for that. They served under the flag we are talking about at this point. The Australian flag is just as important and holds just as much meaning to current serving members of the Australian Defence Force and their families as it does to our veterans, retired Defence Force members and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be a long time before Australia forgets the record medal winning performances of our Atlanta Olympics athletes. There were many truly great moments for Australia throughout the games: Cathy Freeman's silver medal in the 400 metres, gold for the Australian women's hockey team and the Boomers' fantastic win against Croatia in the men's basketball. But there was no greater moment than that of Kieren Perkins in the 1500&hyphen;metre <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> freestyle. He had been written off long before the start of the race by most commentators and media. Like so many other Australians, I hoped Perkins would win, but silently thought otherwise. I was never so pleased to be wrong in my life. It was an amazing, gutsy effort from Perkins to win gold at Atlanta, as it was with all of our athletes&mdash;win, lose or draw.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing they all had in common was the pride they placed in the Australian flag&mdash;our national symbol. When you look at the footage of all the welcome home parades held throughout Australia for our athletes, the thing that stands out amongst all others is the sea of Australian flags being held high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Australia has already begun the countdown to the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Australia will be in the international spotlight, and Sydney will be the stage for a sporting and cultural celebration that all Australians will participate in. There will be many symbols on display throughout that time, defining what it is that makes us Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to see the reaction back here in Australia to some of the symbols of Australia on display during the closing ceremony in Atlanta&mdash;the kangaroo, the waratah, the sulphur-crested cockatoo, the didgeridoo, the surf and the sails of the Sydney Opera House. Australians define themselves and who they are in different ways and through different symbols. For some it is the surf and the sand, while for others it is the outback and the earth. But the one symbol Australian athletes and supporters have united around is the Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard and the coalition gave a commitment earlier this year to implement a legislative change protecting the national flag and ensuring the flag cannot be changed without the approval of the Australian people voting at a referendum or plebiscite. I support this legislation. In our pre-election policy statement on veterans' affairs the coalition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian national flag, as a national symbol, belongs to the Australian people, not the Prime Minister or the Government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA>Earlier this year sections of the media bagged the announcement that we would be introduc <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8207"> ing amendments to the act as political grandstanding and gimmickry. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 20 June asked the question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why legislate if everyone agrees and there is no threat to the flag?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer in the same article claimed that the government was indulging in a bit of political populism. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will dress up the legislation, which fulfils an election promise, by arguing that our most important national symbol can be changed now merely by an amendment to the Flags Act.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not some kind of stunt. This is not an attempt to sidetrack people's attention away from the 9.9 out of 10 coalition budget. We want people to focus on the necessary decisions the opposition was not brave enough to take in its 13 years of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will be made because they are necessary. A good example of just how necessary they are cropped up earlier this year when New South Wales Premier Bob Carr suggested abandoning <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair</EMPHASIS> in favour of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS> as our national anthem for the 2000 Olympics. It was interesting to note that other ALP politicians distanced themselves very quickly from the suggestion and from Mr Carr. If Bob Carr could have his way, he would prefer to have a national anthem about a suicidal sheep thief. The national anthem does not, and should not, belong to any one state minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same goes for the Australian flag, which is just as much a symbol of who we are as the national anthem is. These legislative changes will take the decision out of the hands of the Bob Carrs of Australia and put the power in the hands of the people&mdash;where it should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with the Prime Minister, I describe myself as an unashamed and passionate supporter of the present Australian flag. While I will always support and stand by the present Australian flag, neither I nor any other individual has ownership over it. As with all things in the democratic process, it is the will of the people as a whole which must inevitably prevail. While I hope I never see the day the Australian flag changes its current form, I will fully respect the result of a referendum which shows that a majority of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian people believe otherwise. May I just finish with the last two lines of the verse that I started with on our current flag:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've got the stars to show where we're going</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the old flag to show where we've been.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to participate in the debate. The opposition supports the Flags Amendment Bill, but I need to make the point that the flag that we have was not decided on by referendum. It has served and honoured this nation for some 95 years. I know of no suggestion by any government to change the flag by legislation. All this legislation does is ensure that when change comes&mdash;and change will come; younger Australians will ensure that&mdash;it will carry with it the support of a majority of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to look back at the origin of the flag. I have listened to some of the debate and some of the outpourings from the hearts of members opposite. It is fascinating listening to how they devise history and how they become attached to an article that really was brought together as the result of a competition set about by a tobacco company. When people set out to have a national flag the Havelock Tobacco Company put up &pound;25 to run a national competition. Ultimately, the national government&mdash;and I will go into this in a bit more detail later&mdash;was shamed into adding to that and increasing the prize money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us not have any inhibitions about this. We are Australians; that is how we do things. If we look at the horrific incidence of gambling today, which conservative governments around this country support, in some ways it would be a nasty cut to make if we go back to the origin of the flag and point to the fact that it started out as a competition put up by a tobacco company in the 1900s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8208"> Looking more deeply at Australian history, if you take from settlement in 1788 and the radicalism of Australians, about 100 years after 1788 Australians had sovereign governments in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, but they had this radical idea that even though they had sovereign govern ments&mdash;and each of those sovereign governments or colonies, as they were known, had their own flag&mdash;they wanted to have a federation; they wanted to be one nation. That was pretty radical thinking in those times&mdash;a mere 100 years after settlement as a convict colony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 20 years or so of debate that went on about how to form a federation ensued. When those radicals became accepted and it was agreed that they should form together as a federation, one of the first things they decided was that they needed to have a national flag. This line of reasoning of having only one flag forever&mdash;it must remain forever and without that flag I will be absolutely desolate and probably die&mdash;needs to be seen in the perspective that we have had 36 different flags in use in this country. Each of those sovereign states had their own flag&mdash;and they are all still in use today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can you be a federation with one national flag when each state is still out there busily promoting and spending taxpayers' money on a state flag? You wonder why new settlers in this country or people on the outside looking in are a bit confused sometimes as to the true Australian identity and the true Australian symbol. We are Australians and most of us understand it, but I am sure lots of other people do not understand what we are about. In the 100 years after settlement, federation was developed, the competition was conducted and in 1900 the Melbourne journal the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Evening Herald</EMPHASIS> held a competition with a prize of &pound;25 for the best design. The selected design bears no resemblance to our current flag. It was of stars and stripes, on the pattern of the US flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shortly before the opening of the first parliament there was a worldwide competition to obtain designs for two Australian flags&mdash;one for official and naval purposes and the other for the Merchant Navy Service. The competition was conducted in conjunction with a newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of Reviews</EMPHASIS>. I can recommend that paper for those who want to go back and look at some of the history of around the turn of the century and what the debate that was going on was like. This journal claimed that the previous competition could not be taken seriously, that it was a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> purely local thing; and their competition was a national and international competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The competition was gazetted on 29 April 1901, with prize money of &pound;200&mdash;&pound;75 from the Commonwealth, which ultimately had to come in and contribute; &pound;75 from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of Reviews</EMPHASIS>; and now &pound;50 from the Havelock Tobacco Company. On 3 September 1901 the designs were displayed. Some 32,823 designs were submitted to the judges. The Prime Minister of the time, the Hon. Edmund Barton, announced that the prize money for the winning designs had to be equally divided between five persons whose designs were more or less similar. So the designs were combined, then displayed. Later photographs show that this flag was very similar to the one that was later officially proclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many years the Commonwealth blue ensign was regarded as the official flag and its use on land was restricted to government establishments. The flying of the ensign on land by individuals and non&hyphen;government bodies was discouraged. This is the same flag that we hear members of the government raving rhetorically about. The use of this flag by individuals or non-government bodies was discouraged, although in 1941 Prime Minister Menzies directed that there should be no restriction on the flying of the flag. How could people display this flag and pay homage to this flag when its use on land by individuals and non&hyphen;government bodies was discouraged?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In February 1947, Chifley issued a press statement encouraging the application of a directive from Menzies that the flag's greater use on public buildings, by schools and private citizens not only was permitted but would be appreciated. The proviso was that it be flown in a manner appropriate to the use of a national emblem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian merchant vessels continue to fly the red ensign, but back in 1981 we had considerable debate when there was an attempt by the then Fraser government&mdash;and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would probably recall this&mdash;to eradicate the use of the red ensign. Such was the response from people of merchant mariner origin that the government had to back off, and we still allow, and quite <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8209"> happily, the merchant navy and merchant mariners to use the red ensign as their national symbol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, it had not been clearly established that any particular flag was the national flag until 1951. King George VI approved the recommendation from the government that the Commonwealth blue ensign be adopted as the Australian flag. We can go on and on looking at the history of this matter, but the point I want to make is that, 100 years after settlement, the radicals&mdash;they had to be radicals; they could not be anything else&mdash;wanted to form one nation. They ultimately formed one nation and they then adopted a flag. But they also maintained the use of all the other flags. Many of the other flags are still in use for various occasions and purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About 100 years after federation it fits the pattern that Australians of this generation are looking to some stronger form of national identity. They want something that is more Australian with which they can identify&mdash;not a flag or a symbol that has the flag of another nation on it&mdash;but something that is as uniquely Australian as the Canadian flag is unique to Canada.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No one would dispute the import and impact of the symbol of the Canadian flag, and that is what younger Australians are yearning for. That is why, at the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games, we saw young Australians in the audience displaying the boxing kangaroo, not our national flag. It was simply an expression of our younger Australians' yearning to express themselves and to be seen and identified as uniquely Australian. That is simply the normal process of the development of our culture from our backgrounds, gaining a sense of independence and wanting to be seen and identified across the world as being uniquely Australian. I think that is a very healthy process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the flag will change. It will not be now or next year but some time in the 21st century it will change. It will change when enough people, the younger generations, want it to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look back at some of the reporting around the time the flag competition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was conducted. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> promoted a design, which was more or less the existing flag but, instead of the Union Jack, they had stripes like the United States flag. They were extremely upset when the current national flag was adopted, referring to it as `that motley collection of stars, stripes and angles'&mdash;the flag that is now so revered. But that was a healthy process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply point out these things to express the fact that the process is a changing one. We are a developing nation. We are a stronger, more independent, more outward looking nation than we were at Federation, and we have to make room for that. The young Australians of the future will make their decisions. All this legislation does is state the process. We have no problem with that because, unless the change is acceptable to a majority of Australians, it will not be respected. So we do not have any problem with the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people give very deep thought to this issue. They feel very strongly about it. I was approached by one of my constituents, a woman who is a retiree, and I was very surprised when she said to me, `I have thought a lot about the flag and I have designed one.' I thought, `Yes? This will be interesting.' She asked, `Will you take it down to the parliament and show them my flag and tell them what I think about it?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a bit sceptical, but I said, `All right,' as I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and other members have done when you are not quite sure what you are getting because you have not seen it. I said, `Yes, I will do that.' I have brought the flag with me but, before I show it, I will read the letter she handed to me along with it. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This flag consists of four horizontal panels of equal depths, denoting all our people should be deemed equal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The black and the red of the aboriginal peoples' colours are placed on the top as they were the original inhabitants of Australia. Then the gold and green come next. The gold and green are the colours denoting all who have come here to live since. They are usually associated with us as our national colours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gold is also part of the aboriginal colours, but on this flag the gold and the red are placed together <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8210"> to symbolize a oneness or merging of all our peoples&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and, I suggest, all our cultures. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The large star represents the federation. The others are the recognised stars of The Southern Cross for which Australia is well known throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This flag is not in the right proportions and would need to be adjusted however I think it shows what it would look like.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed by Mrs S. Hurley of 5 Brisbane Street, Noraville, New South Wales, 2263.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud of that lady. It had not occurred to me that people would feel so deeply and spend so much time in thought about this issue. Mr Deputy Speaker, with your forbearance&mdash;I raised this matter with the previous occupant of the chair&mdash;I would like to display this flag. There are people who feel very deeply and think very deeply about this issue. The symbolism that has gone into this flag has great meaning for Mrs Hurley, and I see a great deal of merit in it. It is the kind of thinking that&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, you are one of the deputy speakers who are renowned for their tolerance and understanding in this chamber. I very much appreciate that, as does, I am sure, my constituent. The reason for displaying that flag and showing it to members of the chamber is just to show that there are people out there who honour and respect our national flag. They expect at a later stage in our history that younger Australians will want to change it to something that they perceive to be uniquely Australian, and they are entitled to do that. By displaying that, it brings home to all of us the depth of thought that has gone into that consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, our flag is honoured across the world. It is a flag that is treated with respect and a flag that has served this nation extremely well. Like the state flags, at some stage in our history in the years ahead there will be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> changes as there have been changes to lots of other forms of government and the role of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I also ask this question, and other speakers might like to pick up on it: where does the role of the range of state flags fit into all of this? When you go to a school, on one flagpole is the state flag and on another flagpole is the national flag. We advance the need for a strong national spirit and strong national identity in the international fora, but which one is which? I just do not understand why we still pursue this idea of state flags, the myriad of flags which have evolved which make up that total of 36. The important thing is that we have a strong, appropriate, unique and identifiable national symbol. We have that at this stage in our history. At some stage it will be something different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate the opportunity that you gave me, Mr Deputy Speaker, to display that flag and to put my constituent's point of view as an example of Australians thinking seriously about this issue. It means a great deal to them. I do not have the answer. I do not know what the new design will be, but I have given some thought to it. I put that to the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to the contribution of the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) and the other speakers who have preceded him. I rise to support the Flags Amendment Bill, a bill which does not go so much to the mechanics of government, to the specifics of administrative reform and public policy, to questions of savings or of economics, but perhaps goes more to the more ethereal, symbolic, deeper questions of identity which we as a nation face. I do so having previously spoken in the House on the question of the restoration of civics to the curricula of our primary and high schools throughout the country and the desirability of a proper, moderate, but nonetheless firm, sense of patriotism throughout the population more widely. As the member for Chifley (Mr Price) said, patriotism is not something that can be legislated, but it is something that can, none <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8211"> theless, be nurtured and encouraged. I regard that as a proper function of this parliament and as a matter touching upon the substance of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about flags, which are on one level not a particularly functional item. They do not produce things. They are not part of any manufacturing process. They are flimsy objects whose principal function is to blow in the wind. Yet they do play a very important role in the life not only of our nation but of all nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something mysterious about them. They have a kind of symbolic spiritual quality. They are raised to signify our rising in the morning, and fall to signify our return to repose in the evening. Flags are central to our appreciation of grief and of mourning and symbolise that in a most powerful and arresting way. Flags are raised again to symbolise our victory in battle, and fall to acknowledge our defeat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all the memorials to various military campaigns and wars throughout history, I find that one of the most moving is the Iwo Jima memorial in the Arlington cemetery in the United States which is based on a photograph taken by Joe Rosenthal of six members of the 28 Marines at the moment they took the hill of Mount Suribachi in Iwo Jima. It is entitled, `The struggle to drive the flag into the volcanic soil of Suribachi.' It symbolises for Americans that point of victory in the war in the Pacific, a critical victory for us as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian military forces, likewise, have a great reverence for the flag. It remains the practice, as I understand, for a flag which has been allowed to suffer the disgrace of touching the ground to be taken out by the officers and buried under the cover of night. There is a proper reverence for a symbol like the flag, which the member for Chifley touched on when he was referring to his private member's bill which contemplated the idea of making it unlawful to burn or to deface an Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise to support a greater measure of protection for our flag, for this particular flag, for three reasons. The first of those is the fact that this bill fulfils a promise given by the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coalition in the lead-up to the last election. Just in affirmation of the basic principle that we ought to do that which we promised to do, I am a supporter of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason I am attached to the flag is that I think it is one of the most beautiful, one of the most effective and, dare I say, one of the most representative symbols that one could possibly conceptualise. If we turned to the five key elements of the flag, we would start with the three crosses which make up the ensign in the top canton of the flag. The Australian flag has four crosses. The first three are the red cross of St George, the white saltire of St Andrew and the red saltire of St Patrick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Union Jack is the source of greatest offence to some in this debate. It is a source of irritation, a source of embarrassment. The member for Chifley actually challenged members on this side to defend the presence of the Union Jack in the Australian flag. That is a challenge that I am very happy to respond to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The meaning of the flag is, to some extent, in the eye of the beholder. Often our response to it tells us more about ourselves&mdash;our own prejudices, if you like&mdash;than about the flag itself. I see those three crosses very much in the language of the poem that was read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> by my colleague the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). The crosses do not for me symbolise the unity of the United Kingdom, as much as they symbolise a set of values, a shared culture, the English language, the presence of the common law and a certain spiritual heritage which we in this nation have benefited very greatly from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I speak, I do so in a parliament which was not invented by those who arrived here but which was inherited from the traditions of Westminster. I speak in a chamber which is green. It is not the brilliant verdant green of the House of Commons, but the sort of burnt eucalyptus green of the Australian countryside. Likewise in the Senate, we see the burnt red symbolising the soil of the outback. Nonetheless, the institution is down to fairly fine detail, modelled on that of Westminster. I am greatly attached to the institution&mdash;not just because of emotions or sentiments but <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8212"> because I regard it as one of the most tested, proven and effective expressions of democratic government that can be found anywhere in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when I look upon the canton in the top corner of our flag, I do not feel embarrassed. It is something about which I feel some pride and something which does not offend me in the slightest in terms of our sense of identity and sovereignty as an Australian nation. It reflects, as has been said by previous speakers, our history, our inheritance&mdash;it refers to the foundation stones on which all of the other great things we have done as a nation have been built.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repudiate the view of history that we can somehow invent ourselves each new generation. I take exception to that view of history which was expressed by the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) in a very distinguished work of his, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's foreign relations in the world of the 1990s</EMPHASIS>. In that, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's days of perceiving itself and being perceived by others as a European outpost, a cultural misfit isolated by its geography, are well and truly over.</PARA>
<PARA>I can endorse elements of that statement, but the idea that we view ourselves as a cultural misfit is something which is quite foreign to me. It tells us more about the member for Holt than it does about the mainstream people of Australia. In fact our history is something which ought be celebrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted by the fact that the next speaker in the House will be the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). While seeking to avoid excesses of sycophancy, I would have to say that he has done more than any other individual to restore that proper sense of history and that patriotic feeling which Australians feel deeply and instinctively about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note also that Professor Stuart Macintyre of the University of Melbourne today lamented the demise of history in Australian schools and universities. That is why I want to affirm the importance of preserving a sense of history in our flag and why I regard that ensign as being beautifully democratic and indeed representative of those institutions, those values, the common law, the English <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> language and the spiritual heritage which the three crosses of St Patrick, St Andrew and St George represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We turn then to the federation star&mdash;again, a beautifully non-discriminatory image which embraces each one of the six states and the territories of Australia. Finally, we go to the fourth cross in the Australian flag&mdash;the Southern Cross. Might I say that no image could have a more universal quality. It is difficult to conceptualise one that could be more ancient. When we think about the representation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the flag, it is they more than others who can feel a sense of ownership over the heavens, with their great ideas of the dreaming, of history, of traditions and of tribal values. I regard that as one of the great things about the Southern Cross. For any of us who reside in this hemisphere&mdash;and Australia is the only sovereign continent which is entirely within the hemisphere&mdash;it is a marvellous and beautifully representative image.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take exception to the suggestion by the member for Calare (Mr Andren) that the Australian flag is somehow defective because it is not sufficiently multicultural. On the contrary, it is hard to imagine a more representative and, in my view, accessible set of images than those three crosses, the federation star and the Southern Cross. We need to remember that a flag is not an essay. A flag is not a committee created by some pro rata proportional representation. A flag is an image. It is a snapshot&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A snapshot of the values of a culture which intends to draw together and unite the nation, as my colleague said. That is why I think there is a huge risk in moving away from a flag which has so embedded itself in the hearts and minds of a very broad cross-section of Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Canadian flag is cited as a great example of where we ought to be going as a nation. I have to say that Canada's constitutional arrangements are not something I would wish on any nation. As high as my regard is for the Canadian people, they are looking at a province which seeks secession. They, in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8213"> effect, had their hand forced by the internal divisions and rifts within their own culture and the failure to be united by a common language, and they were forced to abandon what was otherwise a beautiful flag. I find theirs an attractive flag. I quite like it. But I enjoy the fact that we still have a kind of consensus, a sense of identity, which can be encapsulated in the flag that we currently possess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, the Republic of South Africa is cited as a great example of change, of innovation and of reform, and reference is made to the rainbow characteristic. I, like all other members, have followed closely the process of reform in South Africa. I am not as quick to jump in and declare the success of that change as others may be. I hope and pray for its success. I note that, on a statistical basis, among the member nations of the African continent, we may be more judicious to withhold our judgment for some time but to do everything within our power to support the transition to a more representative democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that we ought to be moving to some sort of quota based proportional representation in a national image which will inevitably be fragmented and which will leave some unhappy, some overrepresented and some underrepresented. As the member for Calare rightly said, it would be virtually impossible to imagine a single image which so effectively encapsulates the hopes, the aspirations, the history, the traditions and the values of a diverse country such as Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third basis upon which I support the bill is that it reflects a characteristic of this government which is a desire to bridge the gap which has emerged between the Australian people and their national parliament, their national government. There has been an increasing feeling among many Australians that when they look at the institutions of their national government they feel a sense of discord, a sense of dissonance, and a sense foreignness about that which is coming forth from this place. This bill, if you like, is a step back towards the people. It is just giving them some assurance that they are not going to wake up one morning and discover that, by the arbitrariness and the capriciousness of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> executive, they have had the Australian flag pulled out from underneath their feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that regard, it is not a perfect world. It is not a perfect image. The member for Calare took the view that we ought not to even discuss the bill until we are prepared to have much more wide&hyphen;ranging discussion of the constitution, the republic and various other matters. I see evidence of a kind of utopian perfectionism coming through in some of the remarks of those around the chamber. We are not going to achieve perfection. We are looking for the best possible outcome. It is my view that this bill rightly gives the Australian people that greater measure of reassurance that we are listening, that we are not going to act in a sudden or hasty way, that their views are important to us, that we are a listening government and that we are not about to take one of the important symbols of the nation and simply arbitrarily amend or change it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my colleagues, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), earlier this week talked about Gandhi. He mentioned the fact that Gandhi's perception of power was not the hoarding of power; the greatest expression of power was to give it away. That is the spirit in which this bill is presented to the parliament. It is restoring to the people a greater measure of power&mdash;a greater sense in which they are the ones who own this democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude my remarks with a reference to the fact that that top corner of the flag is traditionally known as the canton&mdash;`canton' coming from the French word meaning corner. Canton is a word that is familiar to we legislators from the Swiss experience of direct democracy in which the people gathered together not in some representative way but directly to take the decisions according to any piece of legislation or any new government initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an appropriate reference for us here. There is a symbolism and a synergy between the canton as the top corner of the flag and the canton as the Swiss expression of direct democracy. The only real equivalent we have to the canton in our Westminster tradition is in fact the referendum. That is precisely what this bill is about. It is being put back into the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8214"> hands of the people&mdash;the canton of the flag is being restored to the canton of the Australian people. For those three reasons, it gives me great pleasure to unreservedly endorse the bill and to urge other members to do the same.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am also delighted to support the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. With its presentation in this place today, a great majority of Australians have breathed a collective sigh of relief. They are the ones who are quite the opposite to those angry, loudmouthed minorities who want to change the Australian flag&mdash;the flag which has united us as a people for almost 100 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many people in this country who were worried about the approach of the former Prime Minister and many others who were running in his pack who saw the flag and other national symbols as up for grabs&mdash;as theirs to change as they would like. They wanted to chop and change them around with little regard for the view of the broader Australian community. This quite simply was a very wrong attitude and contributed to the collective reasons for the decisive view which Australians expressed on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who, back in the budget week, around 22 August, burnt the Australian flag near Old Parliament House should be charged with an offence. I consider such an act on such a day as one against all Australians, because it is quite simply treasonous, in my submission, to treat our flag in such a way. It is a direct attack on all of us who want to work together as a united community. It is not a vote for free speech to burn our national symbols; it quite simply is a vote for anarchy. It is simply not good enough, and I and so many other Australians were deeply offended by such an action on such a day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly time for all of us to stand up and support our national symbols to bring this country together and to work on those things which unite us and not highlight those things which could divide us in the hands of those who want to. There is no need to change our Australian flag. As a Liberal, in a traditional sense, I certainly support change&mdash;change when it is worth while. So, to those who want to change the Australian flag, the constitution, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our system of government and all the other things which are important as national symbols of Australia, I say: prove your case on its merits, not by attacking the current laws, the current traditions and the current symbols which have protected us and united us so well for so long. Prove your case&mdash;prove we can have something better. It is a very difficult thing for those who are advocating change to prove.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This flag of Australia is not mine alone; it is not the Prime Minister's alone. It is the flag for all Australians. It is the flag for war, the flag for peace. It has been the rallying cry in times of trouble and in times of triumph. It is the flag which has dictated our history and our place in the world geographically. It is the flag which hundreds of thousands of Australians have, sadly, died for, fighting to defend our country and our way of life. To change our Australian flag is to spurn their contribution. To change the flag would be an act conceived in ignorance and selfishness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is great interest in the Australian flag in my electorate which certainly reflects the solid support for the flag right across our nation. I am pleased to record how many schools have sought refreshed copies of the Australian flag from my office. I have been pleased to arrange for, and in most cases present, flags to schools like Upper Mount Gravatt State School, Moorooka State School, Wishart State School, Rochedale State School and St Joachim's Parish School at Holland Park, just to name a few. Other community groups who want to see the Australian flag flying proudly in my electorate have included Stephen's RSL and Sunnybank Bowls Club. They have sought new copies of our Australian flag so they can tell all around them and their members they are proud to have it on their flagpoles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of my electorate of Moreton want this flag to stay. Young and old, they have gained a renewed sense of the  importance of our national symbols. This, I submit, is one of the great successes of last year's Australia Remembers commemorative year. Young Australians have now learnt a greater regard for the importance of this wonderful national symbol.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8215">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my constituents, Austin Wilkins, has been the honorary secretary of the Australian National Flag Association of Queensland for many years. He, and a lot of others in his generation, have been stalwarts in the campaign against the noisy minorities who wanted to see the flag changed. I pay tribute to him and to Dr Rupe Goodman of St Lucia in the State electorate of Ryan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My great concern for the passage of this bill stems from the fact that, without it being passed, Australia's national flag, despite the will of an overwhelming majority of Australians, could be changed by amending or repealing section 3 of the Flags Act 1953. A simple act of parliament without any reference to the people in the form of a referendum could make this happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many of the 13 years of the failed Labor government we were rid of on 2 March, the Liberal and National coalition in this place made numerous efforts to entrench the flag. From 1984, coalition members introduced a series of private members' bills into both this place and the other place but none was passed. Those bills sought, amongst other things, to do what this bill aims to do, which is to ensure Australian people have their say on their most important national symbol, the flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a collective sigh of relief across the country, and certainly in my electorate, when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) showed his determination to introduce early in the life of this parliament a bill such as this which will expose any attempts by politicians, and members of this place with big egos, to change our flag without consulting the people. On Anzac Day this year, a most appropriate day for the following words to have been spoken, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new federal government is to take action as promised to protect our great national symbol, the Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on, in words I am very proud to have heard:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation will be introduced early in the life of the new Parliament . . . to ensure the Australian Flag cannot be changed without the approval of all of the Australian people voting at a referendum or plebiscite . . . This will mean no politician, no <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> political party and no special interest group will be able to tamper with the design of our flag.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister is spot on with this assessment, and his motivation in ensuring this bill has been introduced reflects the view of a great majority of people. It is one of a number of actions this Prime Minister has put forward in this place which has been able to unite Australians. His approach has really struck a chord.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to deal with some of the details of the bill. This bill simply reflects the wise principle of the Australian people having the right to be consulted on any proposed change to the flag. The Australian national flag belongs to all people in Australia. This bill provides the people of Australia with a guarantee from this parliament that it is they, and not politicians, who will decide if their national flag should be changed. It does not seek to override the right of parliament to legislate, for it will still  require some legislation to endorse the will of the people and make any new flag which may be chosen law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection 3(2) of the bill says the current national flag ceases to be the national flag if, and only if, the majority of the Australian electorate have approved an alternative design.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This section of the bill requires the existing national flag to be one of the choices offered to the people. It is really quite disgraceful conduct, often promoted in the media by those who want to change the Australian flag, to never put forward as one of the viable options the current flag. What an absolute disgrace and a bit of blatant social engineering to say, through such an action, our current flag is not good enough so choose from one of these others. Put the current Australian flag forward as one of the submissions in any design competition and we know which one will get through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection 3(3) of this bill leaves it to the parliament to prescribe the manner in which a proposal for any alternative design or designs for a new flag should be submitted to the electors and the manner in which the vote is to be taken and the arrangements which might be needed to accommodate any alternative designs selected as a new flag. This is a very good provision. It recognises clearly the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8216"> value the majority of people place in the existing flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge anyone in this place or listening to this parliament today or reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;anybody in this country&mdash;to come up with a better design which can sum up the history of our country better; which can sum up our geographic place in the world; and which meets the vital criterion of uniting Australians, no matter where they have come from. Any new flag which may come in future years would have to overcome the sheer weight of history and real regard and true value which is instilled in our current national flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This flag has been the flag of Australia for virtually 100 years. In fact, on a personal note, six generations of my family have known this flag since Federation. My great&hyphen;great&hyphen;grandfather Robert, who came to this country from Ireland in the 1840s as a two year old and who died in the 1930s, knew the flag. His son knew the flag. My grandfathers, happily both still living, know this flag and they fought in the Second World War under this flag. My father knows it, I know it and my children know it.

So for many reasons we have good reason, on a personal and on a national level, to be very proud of this flag.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a very clever design. It has never been beaten. It not only symbolises our history and our geographic location but also symbolises our system of government. The blue ensign&mdash;a startling, domineering part of the flag&mdash;says to me the Pacific. It really says where we live. The Southern Cross emphasises where we are in the Pacific&mdash;in the South Pacific. When you see the flag, no matter where you have been, whether it is within Australia or around the world, you get the feeling you know where home is.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federation star, with its seven points, depicts the six states and the territories. The Union Jack, as the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) said, in the canton of the flag, represents the flags of the various patron saints of the British Isles. There is the Cross of St George, the patron saint of England and Wales; the saltire&mdash;the cross on a diagonal&mdash;of St Andrew, which is for Scotland; and the saltire of St Patrick, which is for Ireland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can trace my family history back to each of those crosses and saltires, so it says a lot to me when I see our flag. St George and St Andrew were both crucified martyrs. St Patrick was martyred but he died in his sleep; he was not crucified. I guess because I am of part&hyphen;Irish heritage, I can appreciate this aspect. But if anybody can come up with a design which captures the rich history which our current flag promotes, I am sure the Australian people will respond. They, like me, are not afraid of change, but no&hyphen;one has yet proved the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The old argument that our flag is like so many others because it has the Union Jack in the corner is absolute nonsense. The recent Olympics showed the world our flag as we claimed our many sporting victories. We are among only a few other places which have the Union Jack on their flags. The Union Jack is also on the New Zealand flag and, interestingly, the state flag of Hawaii, the island state of the United States of America. It symbolises the history of European settlement in each of those places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to reflect upon a couple of South American and Central American countries which have on their flags the stripes of the Stars and Stripes, the United States flag, because they have some sort of relationship with the United States. So a flag is a symbol which unites us and brings us together. It says something about who we are, where we have come from and how confident we are about ourselves. Many people, I submit, who want to see a change in the flag do not feel confident about Australia or about themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting when the Canadian people voted to change their flag a generation ago, they came up with a compromise called the maple leaf. Everyone knows the flag, but <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8217"> it has ended up being a compromise between those in Canada who wanted to retain the old Canadian flag, which had the Union Jack on it, and those French separatists who wanted to see the Tricolour flying over Canada.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A generation later, after those symbols were changed and a compromise was reached, so many of the same tensions which brought about the move to change the Canadian flag back then have re&hyphen;arisen. Whilst the flag is very attractive to most people, it does not have the depth of history to survive a lot of the tensions currently in Canada, as some are calling for separation yet again. Canada is facing a lot of crises, I submit, in part because its national symbol is not supported by so many people in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would certainly hate to see Australia's national flag changed to satisfy a loud minority and to cause some sort of compromise to exist in this country. There are enough pressures from some&mdash;including some in this place&mdash;who seek to divide this country on certain issues without our changing important unifying national symbols in this country, which is why this bill is so important. The Australian people have shown they can and do galvanise on great national issues. I believe, like me, most Australians want the present flag retained. Recent history has shown no&hyphen;one can come up with a better design or a more appropriate one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge for all of us is to put a real effort into promoting our flag to all Australians, particularly to those who have moved to this country as migrants. In my electorate, migrants, particularly from Asian nations, who have chosen to come to Australia are very proud Australians. In the process they have picked up the point of the flag which has been raised by some who want to see it changed. I say to them, as I often do, it is an important symbol in this country, one which has served us well and helped to unify us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If newer Australians must recognise this flag as the one under which they became citizens, the flag of the nation they chose as their home, then all Australians, especially those born here, must fly the flag proudly. How else can we expect newer Australians to respect it with great enthusiasm?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people from all nations respect the importance of flags. Nations with a sense of certainty and history understand how important national symbols are. Again, with regard to people in my electorate who have come from Taiwan, I often find the Taiwanese flag flying side by side with the Australian flag at functions in my electorate each month. The Taiwanese people know how important their flag is because it is in stark contrast to the communist banner which flies on the mainland. The Taiwanese and all other newer Australian migrants respect our flag, but they and so many other Australians need to know why this flag is so important, why it unifies us, why history is on its side. All Australians must show this flag is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in the beginning of my contribution today, I am very pleased to provide flags to schools in my electorate. It is particularly enriching to watch 10&hyphen;, 11&hyphen; and 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;old students, as happened at Upper Mount Gravatt school the other month, clap and cheer when you unfurl a nice, bright copy of the Australian flag on their school flagpole. I think such experiences show young people do appreciate how important our symbols are. The good news about this bill is it places official, extra, importance on our flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say on another note: in my electorate not only are schools and community groups getting copies of the Australian flag to refresh their tired, old ones, which have served them well, but also the Australian flag flies once again in my own electorate office. I think it is quite sad the previous member did not even display one in his office. It was not there when I arrived and took over the office, but I am pleased to say it has now been restored in the Moreton electorate office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to arrange copies of the Australian flag for various community groups and organisations in my electorate. I am proud of the young people in my electorate who want to fly the Australian flag and make sure their flag is well looked after. I am pleased they are going to carry on the banner of older generations who have fought and, in so many cases, died under the Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to have lent a hand to the debate surrounding this very important bill. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8218"> think this bill is a vital gesture, a gesture which will ensure the flag is more protected from the noisy minorities who want to change the flag, who want to try to fix something which clearly is just not broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In so many ways, this is probably one of the best and most straightforward bills to be passed in this place this year because it says to Australians who feel so strongly about our flag that we recognise their right to have a say and not just leave it in our hands or in the hands of some recalcitrant Prime Minister of the future.

<PARA>I think all people around Australia accept the sentiments in this bill as being very indicative of the way Australia should be run and operated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of discussion in recent times about changing the flag because it does not represent Australia, it is not recognisable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and it gets mixed up with the flags of other countries. By that, the people who want to change the Australian flag are almost invariably alluding to confusion with the New Zealand flag and the British flag, with the Union Jack that forms part of our own national symbol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take a different view to that in that I think it is more important that we as Australians, whether we are within this country or overseas somewhere, watching some sporting event or at a historical event, identify with our national symbol rather than people from other countries immediately identifying the Australian flag. If we lined up all the flags from the different countries of the world, how many could people individually identify? So I do not accept that argument being pushed. Certainly, it will not hurt to have a review, as we propose to have reviews of other constitutional arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), spoke about taking a lot of time as a federal member to speak to different community groups, to present the flag to schools and to talk to young school children at every opportunity to make sure they are abundantly aware of what each of the individual symbols within our flag means and represents. The overwhelming majority of people I talk to want to retain this Australian flag and this Australian symbol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just as important, if not more important, for Australians who identify with this symbol to acknowledge that identification as it is, to be cognisant of the other side of the argument, which is that our flag is not readily identifiable as compared to, say, the flag of New Zealand or the flag of England. I understand there is an important speech to be made by the Prime Minister, so I seek leave to continue my remarks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Today, as the parliamentary year draws to a close, we reflect on the months since March of this year <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8219"> in the knowledge that we in the new government of Australia have been true to our word. We do so not under any delusion that the job is over, but in the knowledge that the job has successfully begun.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We promised to stay in touch with the great mainstream of the Australian community. And we have been true to our word. We promised honest, competent and accountable government. And we have been true to our word. We promised to restore the fundamentals of a sound, growing and competitive economy. And we have been true to our word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We promised more choice for Australians in how they live and work&mdash;more choice for families, more choice in industrial relations, more choice in education, more choice in child care, and more choice in telecommunications. And we have been true to our word on all of them. We promised greater freedom, more incentives for achievement, more competition and less regulation. And we have been true to our word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We promised that, where change is necessary, the reasons for it would be communicated clearly to the Australian community and its burdens would be shared fairly by different sections of the community. And we have been true to our word. We promised no new taxes or increased taxes, the retention of Medicare, the maintenance of the safety net for the disadvantaged and a better deal for rural and regional Australia&mdash;and we have been true to our word on all of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wake of the tragic events at Port Arthur in April, my government, in cooperation with state governments and with the full support of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, delivered strong national gun laws prohibiting automatic and semiautomatic weapons. This action alone has made a lasting contribution to a safer and more peaceful Australian community. Both symbolically and in substance it struck a defiant blow against a culture of violence which too readily permeates our community and which has wreaked such terrible consequences in other nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nine months into our first term, we are still a young government. But we are already a government of clear and consistent values. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Our achievements are being built on a fundamental conviction: that the decentralised networks of families, workplaces and communities of free individuals are far more effective generators of choice, freedom and opportunity than the suffocating centralism of political grand plans and bureaucratic controls. That conviction will remain our enduring guide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking to the future, we know that we have established a secure base camp as we climb a high mountain. We know that we must continue to go forward and that we must do so together. As a nation, we face the economic challenges of achieving high sustainable economic and employment growth at a time when the great driving forces of change and opportunity will be globalisation, technological change and the communications revolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a society, we also confront the tensions and strains imposed by family breakdowns, violence, homelessness, economic hardship and youth alienation in our community. In these circumstances, our agenda for the next year is a clear one. We will consolidate the gains we have made in establishing sound economic management, in advancing the interests of families, in boosting small business, and in building a new framework for higher productivity, more investment and more jobs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we will also move on to meeting new challenges, both economic and social: to tackling our national savings problems; to building a more world competitive economic infrastructure; to enhancing the protection of our environment; to streamlining processes for attracting job creating investment; to making it easier to do business in Australia for the benefit of all Australians; and to rebuilding the social capital of our community through a strategic but limited role for government and through encouraging the talents and potential of every man and woman in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has been left on the sideline&mdash;marginalised, hopelessly out of touch and irrelevant to the reinvigoration of Australian policy making that is now taking place. Labor is left fighting yesterday's battles and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8220"> refusing to learn the lessons of its electoral defeat. It is left noisily insisting that its priorities in government were right and that they remain right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They still cannot understand why an ungrateful Australian mainstream abandoned them so comprehensively. Labor is left practising the last resort of failed political leadership&mdash;trying to scare people by misleading and deceiving them. They will not succeed, because Australia has moved on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while recalling just how far we have come in the 10 months since the people decided to place their trust in a new coalition government on 2 March this year. The compelling need for fiscal repair has been pursued without compromising our main election commitments. We did not create the $8 billion bankcard bill, but we have accepted the responsibility to pay it off on behalf of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economy we inherited from Labor was loaded with large debts, heavy deficits and high levels of unemployment. Our economic strategy is rightly focused on establishing the economic fundamentals for sustained economic and employment growth, action to reduce unemployment over time and a steady improvement in living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have set Australia on a new course of proper fiscal responsibility built on increased national savings, the maintenance of low inflation, reduced pressure on interest rates and restoring the underlying budget balance to surplus. The major building blocks for this are now in place. They include the recently passed workplace relations legislation, the 1996&hyphen;97 budget and new monetary policy arrangements with the Reserve Bank of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our inflation rate compares favourably with that in other industrial countries. Underlying inflation is now comfortably within the Reserve Bank's target range. And forecasters predict that inflation will remain moderate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of lower inflation and the reduction in the budget deficit interest rates have fallen. The Reserve Bank has reduced the official cash rate three times since March&mdash;the latest at 9.30 this morning. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Families and businesses have benefited substantially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families with a $100,000 mortgage are saving around $145 a month in interest payments as a result of the fall in the variable home loan interest rate of 1&frac34; per cent. If today's cut is passed on in full&mdash;and there is already a veritable stampede of banks to do so&mdash;then the saving will amount to $188 a month for the average Australian family. This will drive housing interest rates in Australia to their lowest level since 1974. Let me repeat that: the lowest housing interest rate since 1974&mdash;$188 a month in savings for the average Australian family. What a magnificent Christmas present for the great mainstream of the Australian community!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our first budget aimed to transform the underlying budget balance from a deficit of $10.3 billion in 1995&hyphen;96 to $1.5 billion in 1997&hyphen;98 and a surplus the following year&mdash;a massive turnaround of $8.8 billion, or no less than 1.8 per cent of GDP in just two years. This is being achieved with no increase in income tax rates, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in the wholesale tax rate, and no increase in the petrol excise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also legislating a charter of budget honesty to ensure that the Australian community is kept fully informed of the true state of the economy and the budget, particularly at election time. This ushers in a new era where deceit such as that attempted by Labor at the last election as to the true state of the national accounts will be a thing of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Approval by parliament of the government's landmark workplace relations legislation heralds a new industrial relations era for Australia which will boost productivity enabling higher take&hyphen;home pay and will lay the foundations over time for greater job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to say that the previous government's anti&hyphen;job unfair dismissal laws have gone. They have been replaced with a simpler, more balanced system that provides for a fair go all round. Employers and employees are now able to reach mutually beneficial agreements about productivity and wages and conditions best suiting their particular workplaces. Our support for a safety <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8221"> net increase of $24 a week phased in over three years reflects our ongoing commitment to genuine protection for the low paid in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compulsory unionism has been abolished. It has gone, courtesy of the Liberal&hyphen;National government. It has been replaced by the fundamental principle of freedom of association. Stronger sanctions have been introduced against unlawful industrial action, including union secondary boycotts, which have been outlawed through the reintroduction of sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also concluded an historic agreement with the Victorian government which will give all Victorian workers and employers the opportunity to operate within the one industrial relations system. The old industrial relations system held back growth and held back our country. This government can proudly say that it has given Australia an industrial relations system for the 21st century and not the 19th century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have acted to remove the impediments to growth caused by unnecessary regulation. We have, in cooperation with the states, created clear, fair and efficient procedures for approving new resource projects. We have ended effectively the use of export controls on minerals, except for uranium, terminated the three mines policy, and entered into cooperative arrangements for environmental assessments for new projects with the states. All these measures will especially assist the development of resource projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a strong demonstration of my government's commitment to ongoing investment in major projects of all kinds, I announce today that I will be appointing within my own office a major projects facilitator. The role of that person will be to ensure that speedy approvals are given to major investment proposals which conform with government policy. This person will have business experience as well as a full understanding of the workings of government. We believe that at all times the climate for investment in Australia should be a welcoming one and not one where unreasonable obstacles are thrown up at every turn.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's high interest rates sent many small businesses to the wall. This government will do everything possible to maintain the downward pressure on rates so that enterprise and jobs are not stifled by the cost of capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with our election commitments, the government is accelerating the pace of micro&hyphen;economic reform. Today the government is announcing major reforms in the petroleum products industry which will increase competition.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LATHAM" NAMEID="K26">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about petrol?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Would you like to interject again? Do it again for the benefit of all of us, please. Let me say it again: today the government announces major reforms in the petroleum products industry which will increase competition, put downward pressure on petrol prices and benefit consumers, particularly consumers in the rural and regional areas of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business is part of the heart and soul of the value systems of all members of this government. Small businesses are the engine room of the Australian economy. They provide a livelihood for millions of Australian families. They are the single greatest source of jobs and opportunities in our economy. They are the backbone of local communities and neighbourhoods as well as towns throughout regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting government off the back of small business has been one of our highest priorities since taking office. We are determined to promote the small business sector as a dynamic and expanding generator of jobs, national wealth, economic opportunity and community responsibility. We are re-invigorating it through a range of tax, labour market and deregulatory reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the tax front, one of our first actions was to cut the provisional tax uplift factor. In the budget, we implemented our promises to provide rollover relief from capital gains tax to allow small businesses to grow. We also provided an exemption for up to half a million dollars on capital gains on the sale of a small business where the proceeds are used for retirement. After listening to small business people, we recently made the scheme <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8222"> even better so that the capital gains tax relief applies not just to those rolling over into like businesses&mdash;a change described by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> as the most significant change to the taxation system affecting the small business sector for decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have already made a start on cutting red tape, regulation and the paperwork that bedevil so many hardworking small business operators. The ABS is reducing the burden of statistical collections on small businesses by 20 per cent. The report of the small business deregulation task force was received on 1 November 1996. That document will be responded to&mdash;in full and in a positive fashion&mdash;by the government no later than the middle of February 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is proud to say that it has put Australian families at the centre of national decision making&mdash;whether it be economic policy, social policy service delivery, industrial relations or any other area of government activity. Our more responsible economic management has already delivered great practical relief for families through reductions in home loan interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we also took direct action in the budget. Overall, we have cut the tax burden on families by around $1 billion. From the first day of 1997, the first day of the new year, almost two million low and middle income Australian families will benefit from our family tax initiative. For a one-income family earning up to $68,000 a year with two children, one of whom is under five, this will deliver an extra $34 a fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Opposition members interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through the interjections of the opposition, let me emphasise that this will of course include sole parent families. When it comes to families, we have delivered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will make private health insurance more attractive to low and middle income families. From 1 July 1997, families with dependent children will be entitled to receive an incentive of up to $450 per year, paid either as an up-front reduction in their premiums or as a tax rebate. The government also recognises that, for many families, choice means access to quality, affordable child care appropriate to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their needs. Our child-care strategy will ensure the continuation of a flexible and responsive child-care sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Other measures&mdash;including the retirement savings account, superannuation changes such as the low income spouse rebate, lower interest rates and lower inflation&mdash;will all ease pressures on families and provide them with more choice about how they live their lives. We also believe that the special work of carers deserves more recognition. In line with our commitments, we have provided significant additional funding for the national respite for carers program to augment existing respite funding and establish carer resource centres throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We know that various pressures produce family breakdown and we want to prevent this wherever possible. We have therefore increased funding for marriage and relationship education and funding to enable community organisations to help people become better parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We are addressing the root cause of youth unemployment by establishing the preconditions for real job growth through improved economic management and our regulatory and industrial relations reforms. We are implementing a number of strategies directly targeted at young people which particularly address the development of skills through education and training&mdash;for example, in literacy and numeracy&mdash;and through school-based vocational education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our training and industrial relations reforms will encourage the expansion of traineeship and apprenticeship opportunities. The government has allocated over $200 million over the next four years towards implementing the modern apprenticeship and traineeship scheme. The scheme will bring Commonwealth expenditure in this area to over $1.7 billion over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Integral to our approach to other young people who need help is the development of strong social institutions&mdash;the family, the community and schools. Early intervention, family support and community involvement are critical to the success of our programs to deal with youth suicide and youth homelessness. The youth homelessness pilot program <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8223"> which I initiated, for example, involves community groups working with homeless young people to facilitate family reconciliation and to improve their level of engagement in work, education, training and the community. The national youth suicide strategy, which will receive an additional $18 million over three years, is a real attempt by all governments to address a serious social problem within our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government retains a special commitment to the security and the well-being of older Australians. The value of their pensions is guaranteed through the indexing of pensions on a twice yearly basis in accordance with the consumer price index and by maintaining their value at a minimum of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We are encouraging people to make greater provision for their retirement during their working lives&mdash;for instance, the exemption from capital gains tax where a small business is sold to provide for retirement. People will also be able to continue contributing to superannuation up to the age of 70, and the lower provisional tax uplift factor will also assist many older Australians. Discrimination in the tax system against self-funded retirees has also ended. The tax rebate applying to pensioners is being extended to low income retirees of pension age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have been particularly concerned to protect the economic future of people not readily covered by existing superannuation arrangements. Retirement savings accounts and the new superannuation spouse rebate will improve the opportunities for the accumulation of benefits by non-working or low income spouses. Our private health insurance incentives have also been welcomed by older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We said we would revitalise Australia's regions and provide the basis for renewed confidence in the future. We are well and truly on track to meeting this commitment. A strong small business sector and new investment will provide jobs in regional Australia, and our actions are aimed at encouraging both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some areas of rural and regional Australia are still recovering from the worst drought on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> record. The government has increased the support to farm families until normal cash flows return, so they can get on with rebuilding their properties and help restore the vitality of their regions. We announced in October an additional $81.5 million as a package for areas recovering from exceptional drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also proud to say that the government has introduced legislation to establish the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. That trust will provide more than $1.2 billion for a comprehensive program of action to address key environmental problems facing Australia. Funding for the trust is to be sourced from the proceeds of the sale of one-third of Telstra. Cleaning up waterways and improving land care are both crucial to future generations of Australians in country areas. The coalition is proud that in its first year it has, with the help of Senators Harradine and Colston, moved to implement this historic environmental reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Advanced telecommunications infrastructure is also critical for the social and economic health of regional and rural Australia. The government has moved to ensure the availability of enhanced services such as call waiting, call diversion and high speed access to the Internet through the early completion of the digitisation program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also establishing a $250 million regional telecommunications infrastructure fund to ensure that Australians living in regional and rural areas are not left behind by advances in telecommunications technology. We are determined that there will not be communications haves and communications have&hyphen;nots in this country. We are committed to a policy which delivers a 21st century technology communications system to all Australians, irrespective of where they might live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Transport costs often represent a significant economic hurdle for regional Australia, and the government remains committed to lowering this burden. We will spend $750 million upgrading the Pacific Highway and $149 million on black spots. Our reforms to rail will also provide a more efficient and competitive rail system, thus further reducing the barriers to invest in regional Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8224">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We are also addressing specific challenges in sectors critical to rural Australia, such as the workability of the Native Title Act. We have given forest industry certainty through the granting of transitional licences for three years to underpin future investment and employment. We are working to ensure long-term resource security while protecting high conservation value forests under the regional forests agreement process. We have approved the $500 million Korea Zinc Australia operation at Townsville. Complementary Commonwealth&hyphen;state environmental assessment for the Jabiluka No. 2 proposal and the $1.25 billion expansion proposal for Olympic Dam arrangements have also been announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Australia's trading performance is a vital element of the government's strategy to improve job opportunities and living standards for all Australians. We are therefore putting particular effort into reducing barriers to Australia's exports&mdash;both tariffs and other obstacles. A recently concluded agreement with Taiwan&mdash;I pay tribute to the work of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) in this connection&mdash;will improve our access to markets for beef, citrus and other fruits and cars. As a result, Mitsubishi Australia has already concluded a $35 million deal to export its new Magnas to Taiwan and announced extra jobs at its Adelaide plant. We are exporting fresh milk to Hong Kong for the first time as a result of recent negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year's APEC leaders meeting successfully maintained the momentum for regional trade liberalisation. Australia has already opened up its own economy, decreasing average tariffs to around five per cent. We look to other economies to match us and to respond to us. This year's APEC individual action plans represent a good start. These plans clearly show that the momentum for regional trade liberalisation is there and it is delivering concrete benefits for Australian business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Restrictions on some agricultural imports are being reduced in Hong Kong and Japan. New access for Australian business in banking and investment will be available in China, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Philippines will lift import restrictions on coal, and Thailand will liberalise the natural gas market. In the World Trade Organisation, the government is working hard to ensure that market access commitments made in the Uruguay Round are adhered to. The government also wants to ensure momentum is maintained for further progress beyond the Uruguay Round outcomes in all areas of concern to Australian business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Australia's success and prosperity is tightly bound to the future of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. The government is deeply committed to strengthening Australia's economic and strategic relationships with the other major economies and powers in our region. Within weeks of forming government I held a successful meeting with the Prime Minister of Malaysia. My first bilateral overseas visit was to two of our most important regional partners&mdash;Japan and Indonesia. Discussions with the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Hashimoto, and President Soeharto of Indonesia made clear their interest in cooperating closely with Australia under my government. At the APEC leaders meeting in Manila, I met the Chinese President, Mr Jiang Zemin, and underlined the importance the new government placed on our relationship with that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was delighted to welcome President Clinton to Australia&mdash;only the third such visit to Australia by a United States President. The clear message from both sides during the visit was the enduring strength of the bilateral relationship and a common commitment to our region. The visit built on the Australia&hyphen;United States ministerial talks in July at which agreement was reached on a number of measures to strengthen the Australia&hyphen;US alliance and the contribution it makes to regional stability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government played an important role&mdash;and I particularly acknowledge the contribution of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer)&mdash;in concluding the comprehensive test ban treaty. We will continue to work hard for non-proliferation objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is by any comparison a united, tolerant and internally harmonious nation. The goal of my government will be always to focus on those things which unite Australians <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8225"> and not those which might divide them. Our success in absorbing millions of people from the four corners of the globe in a climate of tolerance and positive espousal of common national goals has been an example to the rest of the world. Despite our success, we must all strive to build on our past legacy of tolerance and egalitarianism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My government is steadfast in its commitment to the process of reconciliation between indigenous Australians and the wider Australian community. We want higher living standards and greater economic independence for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We will work with states and territories and with ATSIC to achieve practical outcomes designed to overcome the undoubted social and economic disadvantage of our indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have demonstrated an enduring commitment to the role of the arts in Australian life. This has included a particular focus on accessibility through innovative programs such as the major festivals fund to assist Australian productions performed in capital cities and major regional areas. We are also providing support through the regional arts fund, the emerging artists fund and the touring programs of the Department of Communications and the Arts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of our commitment to a safer Australia, the government has committed $13 million to the national campaign on violence and crime. This campaign is aimed at more effective coordination and implementation of crime prevention efforts across the country and at the reduction of crime and fear of crime. We are committed to dealing more effectively with the issue of domestic violence. We anticipate specific strategies to be endorsed at the National Domestic Violence Summit to be held in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We remain strongly committed to public involvement in the debate and the decision making process about Australia's head of state and we will announce the next step in that process early next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In 2001, the centenary of Federation provides an opportunity to celebrate Australia's achievements and our immense democratic inheritance. The recently announced Com monwealth appointees to the Centenary of Federation Council will cooperate with the states, local government and community organisations to develop a coordinated program across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For us, the Australian national flag remains a focus of immense national pride. As promised, the government introduced on 26 June the Flags Amendment Bill to ensure that the Australian flag cannot be changed in any way without a national vote of all of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very positive example of this government's commitment to our national institutions is the enhanced opportunity now provided to ask questions in the House of Representatives. Let every member mark these figures. In the last year of the Keating government there was an average of only 12.7 questions each question time. The average so far this year is no less than 19 questions. That is the highest average for the last 20 years. In other words, once again we have stayed true to a promise we made in the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a whole host of other achievements across a range of portfolios and we have only just begun. Ten months on from the election, we are proud of the important start that we have made in restoring good government and responsible policy making at the national level: an important start in rebuilding a sense of national purpose in place of Labor's shifting alliance of special interests; an important start in restoring the family as the centrepiece of national policy making; an important start in fixing the fundamentals of our economy; an important start in re&hyphen;energising small business; an important start in revitalising regional Australia; and an important start in building genuine hope for young Australians and greater security for older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that, in all these areas, what we have achieved is only a start. We need to keep going forward&mdash;and we will. We need to ensure that all Australians&mdash;irrespective of their race, colour, beliefs or country of origin&mdash;are accorded respect and dignity as individuals and are given an equal entitlement <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8226"> to achieve their aspirations free from discrimination and intimidation&mdash;and we will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above all, we need to continue to relate the government's priorities to the concerns and aspirations of the Australian mainstream. We are unashamedly committed to listening to the Australian mainstream and not treating them with the contempt which was the wont of my predecessor in the office of Prime Minister of Australia. We need to continue to relate our agenda to those aspirations rather than to the narrower agendas of self&hyphen;appointed elites and special interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Prime Minister, I am proud of my cabinet, I am proud of my team, and I am proud of my team's achievements. It has been a good 10 months for the Liberal and National parties but, more importantly, it has been a good 10 months for the Australian people who gave us their trust on 2 March.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;What an exercise in fatuous triumphalism! I concede that nobody could have accused us of being excessively modest when in government, but we never had the hide to walk into this parliament with such a mouse like set of achievements and announce them as though we were climbing every mountain, fording every stream, following every rainbow, till we found our dream! We had a couple of Prime Ministers who were amply capable of that, but they had sufficient sense and humility not to try.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people want two things from their politicians. Firstly, they want a bit of humility and, secondly, they want a bit of leadership. That is what the Australian people want from their politicians. The Australian people know that the problems that confront our society are complex. The policies that we pursue to deal with them will not always be right. Fairness and justice are not necessarily manifold in our community. Opportunity is not necessarily available for all. Mainstream Australia carries burdens, some of which it cannot sustain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people know these things. They do not necessarily expect political parties to come up with all the solutions, but when they hear a report from a Prime <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister or a Leader of the Opposition, they expect a bit of balance. They expect a bit of humility these days. Things have changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to compare the mouse like achievements of this government with the achievements made when we were in office. Our achievements included: the deregulation of the financial sector; the establishment of universal health care; the doubling of participation rates in schools; a massive transformation of the higher education sector; the introduction of a totally new competency based training agenda; achievements in the defence industries; achievements in foreign policy, including security and survival for our people; the introduction of a decent retirement plan through superannuation; and bringing into surplus the $25 billion deficit which was left by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he was the Treasurer of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an aside, I was interested to hear the Prime Minister's commitment, because he has been starting to use fudge words on that surplus in interviews. The fudge words came this morning on the timetable for the achievement of that surplus. Well he might use fudge words&mdash;and I will say a bit about growth rates and the possible impact on that later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the achievements of the Labor government, not one Labor Prime Minister came into this place to boast in an annual statement that those achievements had been made by us. We at least had enough sense and humility to say, `You do not need to trumpet your words at any particular point in time. By your deeds, you will be known. You can get your point across issue by issue when you have substantial things to do.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compare the introduction of universal health care in this society with the minor but bad adjustments the government has made to Medicare, about which it is boasting. Compare the achievements in education of the previous government with the slashing arrangements that this government has put in place and now boasts of here as somehow or other achieving its promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compare a government which managed with four per cent per annum growth over the previous four years, maintaining a low inflation rate within the Reserve Bank targets, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8227"> with this government coming into office, building on that inflation rate and sustaining it only by crushing growth in our society. Compare a government that lowered on middle Australia a tax rate from 30 cents in the dollar to 20 cents with one which has produced a paltry family tax package which demonstrated the dishonesty of their advertising that families were going to benefit to the tune of $34 when only one in nine is in fact going to get anywhere near that. Compare a government that did those things to the taxation system with that paltry achievement, and perhaps we have an answer as to the reason why the Prime Minister chose a non&hyphen;broadcast day on which to make this speech. Perhaps we have an answer to that. It is a paltry performance about paltry achievement, full of thundering cliches, volleys of cliches, rolling out across the parliament, but above all, it is a representation of his inability to heed his own words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He warned his backbench against hubris yesterday; he warned them against taking the public for granted and within 24 hours he came in here with a vain, boasting, biased presentation on the achievements of his government, producing hoarse laughter again and again as he claimed honesty, competence of his government, great tax achievements&mdash;one after another, one pathetic performance, one pathetic statement after another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me deal with this question of competence, accountability and honesty. Where? When? Let's take accountability first. We had a foreign minister stand up in this place and admit that he misled parliament and when you looked at the evidence of it you could say it was nothing other than deliberate. Did he go? No. We had a set of ministers come into this place, manifestly in breach of standards that  the Prime Minister said were new standards. Then he said they were really the previous government's standards and then he said they were unachievable standards. If he had attempted to enforce them he would have taken out three or four of his senior ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it accountability when we see a minister surviving in the Senate who repeatedly misleads? She invented a whole new family <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to produce completely misleading information on the real impact of the savaging that ordinary Australian families got in this budget. This is, as far as the Prime Minister is concerned, a demonstration of accountability and competence as far as this government is to be represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had Senator Herron moonlighting, but Senator Herron is turning out a little bit better than expected in recent months. Why? Because we have an Aboriginal affairs spokesman who spends a fair amount of time around there teaching him to read. As far as that area is concerned, we are trying very hard to get to a position with you whereby we can restore a level of confidence in the Aboriginal community that they get fair treatment out of the parliament of this nation. So these are the competent and accountable people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come to the Prime Minister's praise of his foreign minister. Just get rid of him. Do yourself a favour; have a reshuffle. We still have our contacts with the departments in this town; as they said in that film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chinatown</EMPHASIS> we have still got a few teeth in the head and a few friends down town. In every single department bar the odd one or two, there is speculation rife at Christmas time about the shift of their ministers. Sometimes it is the minister who has managed to keep his head down because none of them have demonstrated competence, as that report card has shown. Sometimes the minister who has managed to keep his head down is about to be shifted into a portfolio where a minister has not, but mostly it will be the senior members of his team. Vanstone must go; Downer must go. This is the view in these departments. Downer is obviously going to go. Moore is obviously going to go. All those poor fellows slashed in foreign affairs know they are being slashed to make way for a massive influx of new ambassadors as this Prime Minister gets to grips with the competence or otherwise of his team. And a very hungry backbencher is sitting there waiting for them. So, honest? Competent? Accountable? I am afraid not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then I come to the question of the treatment of this parliament. Yes, we are back to the number of questions asked in the question times of Malcolm Fraser and Gough Whitlam. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8228"> That is the case, and that is an area where we, I must confess, Mr Speaker, were not good performers. We ought to have had more questions in question time when we were in office than we had. But in terms of the treatment of the forms of this House, that is about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw one of the major debates, with the liberty of conscience applying to it, taken out of this House, substantially, and put in the Main Committee. The Main Committee is a good device but it is not a good device for dealing with that particular issue, an issue in which we looked to&mdash;and I think obtained from&mdash;our members of parliament for a heightening in the public perception of the quality of the people in this place, but it was not on display. That was not an advance on standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have this unusual position. You, Mr Speaker, are the only Speaker who has been successfully defied by a Prime Minister and a Leader of the House. Not even this Prime Minister's predecessor, who was exceptionally hard on speakers, did that. I can recollect an occasion when the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), in a fury, dealt with that particular issue from the then Prime Minister and got an apology from him. As far as I am aware, Mr Speaker, you have not gotten one from this Prime Minister, and you should have. The standards that are required in this parliament of the people in leadership positions are very substantial standards indeed and yet this Prime Minister simply has not been able to provide them,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as a bit of humility, a bit of balance, a bit of even&hyphen;handedness, what the Australian public also likes to see is a bit of leadership. The Prime Minister mentioned guns and the laws that have been implemented to deal with the plethora of firearms in our community. We have congratulated him on this many times and he showed leadership in the Australian community on that issue. However, I think we are sufficiently distant from it now to do a bit of analysis. The simple fact of the matter is that this was not necessarily a tremendously difficult task to undertake. It was a negotiating task, there is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no question about that, though not for the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only in the Prime Minister's party do there reside people who are&mdash;and I do not put this in pejorative terms at all&mdash;part of a gun culture, people who enjoy gun collection, people who enjoy shooting, people who enjoy hunting. They are not replete in the Liberal Party. There are a fair few in our ranks, I have to say, including one or two on my front bench and in my caucus. There is also a plethora of them in the National Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to hand out a bit of kudos in this speech. I want to praise Tim Fischer. I think he showed marvellous leadership on guns, magnificent leadership on guns. He had a battle. Tim Fischer and his colleagues in the National Party&mdash;and I congratulate them collectively&mdash;had a battle. They had a struggle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to take that a point further on Tim Fischer. He alone amongst those in leadership positions in this government has stood unequivocally against the statements made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). He alone, on the front bench of this government, was prepared to sign that declaration on racial tolerance. He alone&mdash;as far as that front bench was concerned, and the foreign minister is out the back door as far as this issue is concerned&mdash;understood immediately, without being told, the impact that this would have on our relationships with the region around us. He alone understood what was required in the exercise of leadership in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something else that needs to be said here and that is this: the statements of the member for Oxley, execrable as they were, were not unusual or unique in their expression, either in the Australian community or, for that matter, in parliament. They were not. They happened to be exceptional in their erroneous factual basis, but the motives underlying them were not exceptional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What changed the debate was a statement about freedom of speech. Although there was a qualifying remark in it that said that freedom of speech was not licensed, unfortunately when these things get out into the ether the first sentence is not necessarily followed by the second. Putting the genie back in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8229"> bottle has required an extraordinary effort ever since. And it is not as though the American President&mdash;and he got some reference in the Prime Minister's remarks&mdash;was not alert to that and it is not as though there was not an element of deliberation in the American President's remarks when he was over here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that was a bit of leadership that went lacking as far as the Prime Minister is concerned. It is a very narrow definition of leadership which glories in our poor performances in the polls and seeks to make them worse by seeing whether or not we can tweak the immigration issue a bit. It is a very poor leader who goes into the caucus of his party and says, `A terrible mistake was made by the Labor Party because it did not support all our changes in the immigration area. I would just like to tweak that one a little bit.' That is not leadership in this community. That is being narrow and poll driven and ultimately dangerous in terms of the security and the coherence of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You like to see a bit of even&hyphen;handedness&mdash;and from to time we have had even&hyphen;handedness from the Prime Minister on the record of his predecessors. We do not get it now and we did not get it in this speech. But take the remarks he made about inheriting a terrible economy and all the rest of it and contrast them with his remarks to international bankers when he described the economy that he inherited as better than good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How else could you describe an economy that had four years worth of four per cent growth? How else could you describe an economy that was enjoying about twice the rate of employment growth of any other industrialised nation? How else could you describe it other than that? How could you describe an economy which had a low interest rate regime and had a low inflation rate when this government got into office? That is how you describe it: you describe it as better than good, and so it was described by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He set great store by the difficulties he felt he faced when he had his budget. Let me just suggest to him these things: the way in which he handled the budget and the particular deficit problem he confronted was completely <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wrong. He implemented a set of promises which had not been properly funded and decided to describe them as core and then blame the previous government for the fact that he had to make even greater savings than he might otherwise have had to to achieve the level of balance that he wanted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But he was politically driven by that budget. He decided that he would knock over a lot of public policies that he, in the last few years, said he supported but really did not. His intentions were there in Fightback, in all their pristine purity. He used it as an excuse to knock out that good public policy to produce for himself a situation in which he hoped, three years down the line, he would have a budgetary position that would provide him with a war chest to deal with his subsequent election campaign. Unfortunately for this nation it was the wrong prescription at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the sort of budget that you put in place when you are confronting a boom. It was the sort of budget that you put in place when you have massive surging business confidence. It was the sort of budget that you put in place when the economy has not effectively plateaued and started to slow. That is the sort of budget that you put in place then. Not now. You always have to exercise a degree of fiscal discipline. I might say to you this: we did, ourselves, produce three surpluses; you have not yet. You say you will produce one from this budget but you have been fudging your words this morning. That will be an interesting thing for another debate at another time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But your prescription was wrong. Tightening? Yes. The wholesale tightening and the destruction of good public policy? No. That was politics, not economics. That was not what the nation needed at this point of time. Nevertheless, that is what you chose to put in place and you are therefore required now to overclaim for yourselves. You have no responsibility whatsoever for the lowering of interest rates, except a negative one. You have contributed to the flattening out of the Australian economy. That has been your role in lowering interest rates. What has caused interest rates to come down&mdash;the essential <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8230"> underpinnings of it&mdash;is that we achieved low inflationary growth, sufficient for the Reserve Bank to be trusting of the situation in which they find themselves. Secondly, it is we who introduced the productivity based wage reforms, which have ensured wage outcomes that the Reserve Bank could begin to trust. What has come out of your industrial relations changes is paltry in comparison to what came out of the changes that we put in place and, I might say, as we have pointed out repeatedly, completely unnecessary. Don't think the business community doesn't know it. The business community is not doing handsprings, not jumping through hoops, on the basis of the industrial relations changes you have put in place. At best it is pretty ho&hyphen;hum as far as they are concerned. The business community has made that, I might say, both publicly and privately abundantly clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was those changes that we put in place that produced the low interest rate regime, in case you had not noticed, despite the fact that we jacked up interest rates marginally a couple of years ago. It was marginal. It was not a massive increase in interest rates whatsoever and we left the way for them to come down. Unfortunately, I think the Reserve Bank has made a misjudgment. I agree with Bernie Fraser and I said so at the time, given that there is no stimulus coming through from the budget, given that the economy has been substantially talked down by this government. They are now trying to talk it up, but they have spent six months doing the opposite, sending the other message. Given all of that, their one last hope in town was for the Reserve Bank to produce a bit of a punch through and they really should have done a one per cent cut&mdash;three or four weeks ago&mdash;not the half that they did and the half that they did today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The half a per cent cut today is not a matter for triumph for this government. The half today is a matter of sadness&mdash;if you like, sorrow. It is a correction which should have been undertaken a few weeks previously and which could have been. The Reserve Bank is overly concerned about the wages position; it has been for some considerable time. Treasury is constantly underestimating the inflation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> position. It was a problem with us and now, evidently, it is a problem with you. Treasury has found it hard to produce the inflation figures that are really happening. They are constantly overestimating the difficulties with inflation in this nation. It is part of the model that perhaps you need to do something about correcting. It was certainly a matter which troubled us from time to time when we were in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inflation rate under us&mdash;and it will be so under you too&mdash;is less than anticipated and therefore, there is room for far more movement in interest rates than immediately meets the eye. I hope the new Governor of the Reserve Bank will bear that in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Banquo's ghost at the feast, the question of jobs was there haunting the speech. But it never manifested itself in any serious way at all. A whole series of assertions without evidence was made. Somehow what we are doing on industrial relations will create jobs. What is going to happen here? Interest rates will create jobs. The economy getting the fundamentals right will create jobs. Nobody agrees with you. There is not a single serious analyst out there who expects anything other than a completely lousy jobs outcome and that includes your own Treasury. What an extraordinarily paltry set of predictions they made on job outcomes for the course of the next three years. It was about 60 per cent of our rate of achievement and on the last set of figures, everybody said, `Oh gee, terrific, after four months of coming down, we've got a 2.1 per cent lift in the ANZ jobs vacancies predictor.' What does that produce? Half the rate to achieve that paltry figure of 60 per cent of what we achieved. No wonder it was Banquo's ghost at the feast as far as jobs were concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the one jobs initiative we got? What we got was Laurie Brereton. If we really got Laurie Brereton that would be a good thing, but we will not actually get Laurie because he is going to stay on the frontbench&mdash;and he will be chained to the bench if he tries anything in this regard! What we got was the re&hyphen;creation of Laurie Brereton's job. If people cast their minds back to who the new projects officer was, they will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8231"> realise it was Laurie. Very successful he was, too. A mine or two in the north of this country are directly the product of Laurie's activities. I wish the government all strength to its right arm on the new projects officer, but do not try to sell him as some sort of invention or great initiative in the area of jobs, because he is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as jobs are concerned, we have seen a rate of increase in long&hyphen;term unemployment of about 10,000 a month since the middle of this year. It is falling in a heap and starting to reach crisis proportions. The number is up from about 200,000 to closer to 270,000. We have a situation now where serious problems are going to be created in our society. Your answer to that in the education and training area and in the encouragement of people into the work force is to slash Labor policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The junior Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) constantly gets up in this place and produces bogus figures. The outcome of our traineeships&mdash;and those traineeships were increasing exponentially when we left office&mdash;was 83 per cent in terms of jobs achieved. The outcome from skillshares was 60 per cent. They are dead. Despite the best efforts of the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) to portray this government as sympathetic to skillshare, this government has killed large numbers of skillshares stone dead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite what the government says about MAATS&mdash;which is at best the re&hyphen;badged training arrangements that we put in place; and we were expanding traineeships into areas of employment where there had been no formalised training before and building on what we did in establishing competency based training&mdash;despite the boasting about the amount of money devoted to it, if you actually take what we spent on training in the various equivalent programs that we had in place, there has been a massive cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government thinks that by simply mentioning a number and putting it in a vacuum and saying, `Observe the beauty of it,' it has actually said something meaningful in terms of whether or not we are going to get improvement on where we have been and where we are going. Of course, we are not. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> What the government has done is to massively pare that back, and there will be penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that this government does not quite realise yet is that it is not still in opposition. It still believes that by simply asserting things, by simply making statements as though they were fact, it will produce outcomes that are somehow equivalent to it. It will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that youth unemployment is rising. The reality is that long&hyphen;term unemployment is rising. The reality is that unemployment is rising. Not a single decision taken by this government will do anything other than exacerbate it, whether it be cuts to the public sector, the partial privatisation of Telstra, or what it has done to the whole range of industry support packages that we put in place that were actually providing the means by which we had massively improved our export performance in complex manufactured goods and services. They did not come out of nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the performance of the firms which were in some way the beneficiaries of the R&amp;D concessions&mdash;the various bounties, be they for the computer industry, books or shipping; or the various plans, such as the car plan and the steel plan&mdash;or the firms associated with those industries, and compare them with those which have not so benefited, the rate of contribution, the increase in our exports, is approximately three to one in favour of those so assisted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the government going to do when it kills them&mdash;when it kills jobs but also kills exports? The government is re&hyphen;creating for itself this current account deficit problem. Yet it is now parading around the business community arguing that there should be some stimulus. Treasury is saying, `No, we have to keep growth between two per cent and 3&half; per cent so we can resolve the current account problem.' It is going to be two per cent forever if that happens to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is that we have always been able to sustain a level of current account deficit of around three to four. It is when it gets to six that you worry. It did go to six once or twice under us. It went to six once or twice under the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. That is when you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8232"> require a haul&hyphen;back. But, if you allow yourself to buy that line, what you are going to do is create the seeds of your own problem, a problem which will eventually render employment growth in this community sclerotic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am afraid to say that one of the answers they have started to develop to this is the worst answer of all. I am going to campaign on this. We are going to make an issue of this around the community. We revolutionised the structure of the labour market in this country when we were in office. Actually we did not. Let me not be boastful. We did not do that. We responded to it. What revolutionised it was a lifestyle change determination made by the women of Australia. We did not do it. We simply tried to facilitate it where it occurred. But they made the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many things happen in the economy which governments cannot direct. They have to respond to them. But you are trying to direct it. What you are trying to do in the propositions that you are operating on at the moment&mdash;be it in the area of child care or be it in the area of weighting your assistance packages to families&mdash;is drive women out of the work force. They cannot go. If they go, every woman who leaves is materially disadvantaging her family position. Many of those women who are earning $90, $100 or $150 a week, as well as getting some enjoyment out of life and a bit of self&hyphen;fulfilment, are supplementing the family income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are doing in child care will probably succeed in driving a few of them out. But they will not go out to a great family tax package. What they will go out to is a decline in family income, a decline in security in the household and a fear in that household that they have lost one breadwinner in the work force and something may happen to the other one. I am afraid to say that an awful lot of women who are in the position I have so described happen to be married to men who are in the most vulnerable sectors of the work force when it comes to restructuring. So, the fears that they have are going to be augmented by the fact that they come from families constantly under stress on the question of whether or not they have a secure future for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> themselves and whether or not they are going to be able to keep going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Prime Minister, do you think they are going to spend? Do you think they are going to make a consumer contribution? Do you think they are going to make a consumer contribution to the sorts of growth figures that we need? No. They are voting with their feet at the moment. There is a declaration going on this Christmas in the shops and shopping centres of this nation about the level of confidence they have in their future as families. They are voting with their feet and they are walking out of those shops, or they are not walking into them. If they walk into them, they are walking out of them with nothing. They are doing a process of window&hyphen;shopping; for some of them it will be truly Dickensian in what they are presented with and what they cannot have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They want to give your government a go, Mr Prime Minister. They really do. They were sick of us. There are no two ways about that. We were a hard government, we ran hard&hyphen;nosed policies, we were efficient, we changed things that needed to be changed; but we were not loved. We were respected by some; but we were not loved. A judgment was made that they wanted us out of the way, and they heeded you when you said that you wanted them relaxed and comfortable. They really crave that. They crave being stress free. You should have used that expression which they use themselves, rather than `relaxed and comfortable'. That is not what they talk about. They do talk about stress. As you would know from the focus groups that your party runs&mdash;they are the same as the focus groups that ours runs and they will have the same results&mdash;those families feel stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You boast about this tax change that one in nine families gets&mdash;the $34. Talk about truth in advertising, talk about honesty and accountability in government! One in nine families gets it. And what else do they get? They get HECS charges, they get pharmaceutical increases, they get job insecurity, they get a whole range of changes to government benefits that affect their families. Do you not think that young families are worried about what happens to their aged parents? <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8233"> Your minister is out there saying, `Perhaps families ought to provide.' Who are these families who are going to provide? The families who are going to provide are the families who are supposed to be benefiting from those tax changes. They are trying to keep their kids and they wonder what the heck they are going to do with mum and dad. A few of them are going to resent the fact that one of the things that is not going to happen to them is that little bit of boost in the family income that they expected when mum and dad go&mdash;from the family home. It will have gone towards keeping mum and dad when they finally have to be kept in a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I have got any major quarrel with this government, and I have got many of them, none goes further and none is more strident, I would say&mdash;aside from the industry policy area which I have already mentioned&mdash;than the area of education. What a stone is being served the children of Australia! What a stone&mdash;let us get biblical about it&mdash;is being handed to the children of Australia. They are being told now that they have got to get out of university. The tremendously debt averse middle Australia&mdash;and they are debt averse&mdash;are being told they will be debt ridden as they go through university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can advise them, as a person who has been used to public policy for some time, that they may well be able to sustain that debt in the income they earn ultimately. I can advise them of that, but they will not believe me. I tell you what, they will not believe you, either. They will not believe you, and the proof of the pudding is in the eating of what you have already confronted. The figures that are coming in now from the universities are dramatically down&mdash;and, I might say, other figures are down as well. An awful lot of those women I talked about, who were joining the work force and were going to university under the arrangements, are gone. If you think the figures are down for school leavers, try taking a look at the figures for those women from middle Australia who had decided to re&hyphen;enter the work force and retrain themselves. Where have they gone? Not to university any more. That is what has happened there.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else has happened with the universities? I did think that the objective of government was that we wanted a large, skilled work force, a clever country, a work force scientifically, technologically and engineeringly adept. I did think we wanted that, and I did think the Australian people wanted that. I do think they believed that, when they elected Mr Howard, they would continue to get it because, when we said they would do exactly what they did on HECS, Mr Howard said that we were lying. They said that about us. `Labor lies' was the pamphlet that went out. `Don't believe Labor when they say that we are going to increase HECS to you and make you pay at a lower threshold; Labor will lie about that,' they said. I suppose, in a funny sort of way, we did. The sort of thing we asserted was about half what they did. But that was accidental, I assure you, Mr Speaker. We did not believe that they had the gall&mdash;the sheer, naked, unmitigated gall&mdash;to declare the universities of Australia a non&hyphen;core promise. What an extraordinary thing it was that they should have done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Add that to what they have done to industry, add that to what they have done to the clever part of industry, and where is the vision for this nation? There is one great thing about Australians and it is this: we are one of the most technologically adept societies. I am sick of hearing people say, and the columnists write in their columns, that Australia is a nation that is either in decline or is somehow or other standing in the shade as far as the Asian tigers are concerned. To hell with that! It is baloney when you look at the performance of our information technology industries. We are, in absolute terms&mdash;we are not talking relative terms here&mdash;the second biggest user of information technology in this part of the Pacific Rim. We are beaten by Japan. We are not beaten by South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand&mdash;all the other tigers to whom people refer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very good, and we are very good because we have the right education system, because we have the right industry policies and because we have the right structure in Australian industry to deal with the challenges that face us. You could not admit, Prime <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8234"> Minister, that we are a bridge to Asia but we do need a bridge to the 21st century. And the bridge to the 21st century lies in the quality of our education system and its ability to deliver contemporary technology to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to go on a deal further with this because, really, this is not a speech that warrants any substantial response. I have tried to do a thing or two to assist that process, but I will conclude in one area&mdash;foreign affairs and defence policy. Mr Prime Minister, you are failing, your government is failing, in the area of foreign affairs and defence policy. Your government has inherited a wonderful position&mdash;as you acknowledge yourself when you go overseas, not here&mdash;from your predecessors. You do not have the ideas or the personnel to match it. You are not savable in that area, and, as a result of that, this country will be damaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The absolute ineptness with which you have handled those issues which your foreign minister has had to deal with has been really amazing, even to us. There are things that you can do. I will make a suggestion to you because I think I should have a few constructive things in this speech, and I have had one or two constructive suggestions. The thing that you should do is this: fire Alexander. You should have done it a few months ago. He has absolutely no credibility in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. He is the bearer of a piece of dishonesty on DIFF, as far as the region is concerned, and this means he can never recover. Wandering around the place flashing leg in fish&hyphen;net is not an answer. They do not take him seriously&mdash;get rid of him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to you that you appoint either your industrial relations minister or your environment minister. I do not say that because they are any good. They are certainly not up to the mark that we established, but at least they are not Alexander. That is a very important attribute as far as the foreign policy of this nation is concerned. You should do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you should do more than that. You should send them around quietly&mdash;not openly, not publicly; we do not have to humiliate ourselves&mdash;to say, `We did not understand <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when we dealt with you on DIFF what the real meaning of that was, and we are going to correct it.' You do not have to say that publicly. We will find out about it anyway. Do it privately; do not humiliate this nation. It is not required. We never want to see this nation humiliated, but do do what I suggest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then give him an assistant and leave that assistant out there. You have a big enough majority around here. Leave that assistant out there all year, and then go yourself. You missed a wonderful opportunity in India, as our foreign spokesman. I know they were to roll the red carpet out for you. In a funny sort of way I am grateful you did not go, because they rolled it out for me instead. But that was not good enough. It should have been rolled out for you. You had a great opportunity and you turned it down. As far as this nation is concerned, that was a sad thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Get that foreign policy of yours in order as best you can. At least keep it ticking over until some really competent people can get their hands on it again. At least keep it ticking over for a few years until we can do that. But part of the process is to really understand the resonance over there of what happens in domestic Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final point is that you and I, Mr Prime Minister, have this obligation, and I hope you recognise it: all Australians have to feel relaxed and comfortable. No matter what their racial background, no matter what their social background, they all have to feel comfortable in this society, and they also have to feel energised. They also have to understand that they are contributing to building a great nation; that they are contributing to building a national structure which will ensure the survival of this nation; that they are going to need to be educated to do it; that they are going to be secure in their health; and, above all, that they are going to be secure in their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They must not be frightened at home; frightened of their employers; frightened of the future of their industries; or frightened of what happens if a spouse loses their job. They must have that security. If you govern on that basis, Mr Prime Minister, you will get support <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8235"> from us. But, so far, you have not governed on that basis.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying before we adjourned to listen to the address of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Australian flag is a very important symbol. We should recognise it as a symbol which is more important to the people that live within Australia that recognise it as our national flag and as our national symbol; we should not place so much emphasis on what it means or its recognisability to people overseas. I think that is a very important element in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that earlier this year AGB McNair polled a number of Australians as to whether they thought the Australian flag should be changed. Sixty&hyphen;six per cent said no and only 27 per cent said yes. That reinforces the comment I made earlier with regard to the attitude, particularly amongst young people in Australia today, to our national symbol, and it is very important. I make a particular effort to get to as many schools as I can in my electorate, not just presenting the Australian flag to young Australians but actually explaining the importance and the significance of the elements of our Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is incredibly important in that educational process and I think that is probably what has been lacking in recent years. In my generation, we used to have the flag raising ceremony at school and we used to go through the process. But we were not ever taught at school about the importance of the elements and the symbolism of that national flag. It is important to note that a flag tells a country and its people their history. It symbolises our beginning and our heritage. The Australian flag tell us where we came from, where we are and our duty to the future. It is well known across the length and breadth of this country&mdash;the symbolism of the Southern Cross. That signifies where this great south land sits in the globe and in world affairs, that we are in the southern hemisphere.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, during the Australia Remembers year last year, I had the opportunity to talk to a number of prisoners of war who were incarcerated in Changi Prison in Singapore during the Second World War. One of the things that kept them going through those very hard years was the fact that they could actually see the Southern Cross in the southern sky and they knew that is where Australia was. That is incredibly important to those people, as it should be to everybody today. The Federation Star was originally on the flag as a six&hyphen;pointer but then the territories were added and it became a seven&hyphen;point star. That symbolises what the Commonwealth of Australia is made up of, that we were a number of colonies or states to start with that came together as a federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as importantly, there is the Union Jack. There is not a broad understanding of the importance and the heritage of the Union Jack. I suppose it is important to me as a Christian, but the Christian and biblical background of the Union Jack is very important and it is something that should be understood by all Australians if we ever got to the situation where as a country we were going to vote on whether or not we should be changing the flag. We should understand the elements of that flag. Yes, the Union Jack is the flag of the United Kingdom, it is the flag of another country, but the elements that come together to create the Union Jack have a much deeper cultural meaning to a lot of people in Australia than just the fact that it is a flag of another country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The date of the completion of the Union Jack was 1801, and this coincided with the growth of the British commonwealth of nations under Queen Victoria. But what does the Union Jack mean? There are three things to remember about it: its name and the three countries it stands for; the three crosses and their meaning; and the three colours, red, white and blue, and their meaning. Originally, under the reign of King Richard I, in about 1189, the English flag had only one cross because it was for one country, and that was England. This cross was red on a white background and was called St George's Cross, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8236"> after St George, who was the patron saint of England.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to know a bit of background about St George. St George was born around the second half of the third century at Lydia in Palestine. His father was an officer of great wealth in the army of Diocletian, the Roman emperor. His mother was a daughter of the Count of Lydia. This Lydia is the same area that St Peter himself visited, which visit resulted in the conversion to Christianity of the whole town. That is the Cross of St George, and that is the red cross.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1801, in the reign of George III, Ireland was added to England and Scotland and with Ireland came its national flag of St Patrick, a red diagonal cross on a white background. The three crosses were then blended together to become our present Union Jack, which signifies the union of England, Scotland and Ireland as one Christian country under the blessing of the cross of the new covenant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">St Patrick of Ireland has an interesting background as well. St Patrick is the patron saint and national apostle of Ireland and there seems to be some confusion as to his exact date and place of birth. This is probably brought about by the fact that St Patrick is often mistaken for other characters of the same name and the same era. The most common evidence is that he was born in Dumbarton, Scotland, some time around the year 373 A.D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third element of the Union Jack is the Cross of St Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland. The national religious emblem of Scotland is St Andrew's Cross and he is the patron saint of Scotland. According to the Gospel of St John, Andrew was a brother to St Peter and is the first apostle named. The gospel further states that Andrew was a disciple of John the Baptist before Christ's call.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, they are the elements that make up the Union Jack. It is not just about the flag of another country, it is about a biblical heritage. And with this nation being predominantly a Christian nation&mdash;and I admit it is not all Christian&mdash;it is very important that we recognise the symbolism and the heritage in those three elements of the Union Jack. It is not just about the cross of another nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that some commentators say that the name, the Union Jack, is a contraction of the union of Jacob and that the settlers in England, Scotland and Ireland were actually from the sons of Jacob who ended up in Great Britain. The Union Jack is actually the union of Jacob. That is very interesting to note. This is one argument that is quite often put with regard to the development of that national flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, let me say that it is very important to the people of Australia, if they are ever going to consider changing our national flag, that they have the opportunity to vote on it. The flag is not to be changed within this place by politicians, by governments. The people of Australia must have the opportunity to vote on any change to our national flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, and most importantly, everybody in this country should understand the different elements of the flag and the symbolism that is contained within that flag. I encourage all members in this place to take the opportunity to distribute the national flag, particularly to schools in their electorates, as I do, and take the opportunity to explain the important symbolism and heritage that is contained in the different elements in the Australian flag. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given the fact that the big hope for creating jobs in my electorate of Robertson, and throughout Australia, rests with small business, what action is the government taking to take away disincentives for small business to grow?</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8237" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not surprised that a question about small business should come from the member for Robertson. Not only is the member for Robertson one of the many examples of successful men and women in small business who have entered the parliament on the Liberal and National party side, but he is also someone who has a very deep understanding of the role of small business in the Robertson electorate. I think it is one of the reasons he was successful at the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say in response to the member for Robertson that there are many things that can be done to expand the economic and employment potential of small business. I am very pleased to remind the House of the steps that have been taken by the government in the area of the provisional tax uplift factor and also in some other taxation areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will remember that in the budget we announced that as from 1 July 1997 capital gains tax rollover relief would apply to small businesses with assets below $5 million. This is the important thing to note: at the time of the budget announcement we said that this would apply if the assets were rolled over into another like-kind business. But, as a result of representations that have been made to the government from small business, we have decided to take away that condition. The Treasurer announced last week that the like-kind business test would not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular amendment will greatly increase the incentive to invest in small business. It is going to result in a substantial reduction in compliance costs for small businesses wishing to qualify for the measure. In addition, the government has decided to extend the period&mdash;this is also a further important liberalisation&mdash;for reinvestment of the proceeds of the disposal from 12 months after disposal until 24 months after disposal. That is a doubling of the period of time. Not only are we removing the like&hyphen;kind business test but also the period has been doubled. No wonder one of the most authoritative commentators on business policy from both sides of politics in Australia, Robert Gottliebsen, somebody who on occasions has been quite critical of the coalition as he has been critical <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8238"> of the Labor Party, was moved to write in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> only last Friday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The small business capital gains tax rollover relief is the most significant change made to taxation in Australia for decades. It will revolutionise the way many talented people in Australia generate their income.</PARA>
<PARA>Here you have an absolutely emphatic endorsement from an objective source, an endorsement not from the backbench of one or other side of politics but from somebody who is recognised as an objective observer. He is saying that it is a measure of the coalition; it is the best move for decades in this taxation area; and it is going to revolutionise the way talented people in the Australian community&mdash;men and women who want to take a risk and invest in small business&mdash;can order their affairs. I cannot think of a more emphatic endorsement of the pro&hyphen;small business policies of the coalition.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

What will be the benefit for consumers of these reforms?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8240" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Indi for his question. I acknowledge all the work that he did before the election in helping the coalition announce its policy and in bringing that policy to fruition today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government today announces the most comprehensive shake&hyphen;up of the petroleum industry, at least in the last two decades. This is a great structural reform in relation to the petroleum industry. This is a reform which has the capacity to deliver real benefits to consumers. Let me make it entirely clear that, in setting this policy, we have taken into account consumer benefits for those in both regional and rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1997 the government will lift the price surveillance in relation to petroleum products. It will be lifted once the oil majors have provided suitable undertakings for complete and open access at terminals not only to current distributors but also to new entrants, to new independents and to new wholesalers. This will mean that people who arrive at oil terminal gates will have access at open and transparent prices in relation to the material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government will also ensure that the Laidley agreement is not enforced. The Laidley agreement was one of those grubby deals done by the TWU in order to prevent open access to oil terminals. One of the reasons why the Labor Party did nothing about petrol pricing in 13 years was it was incapable of standing up to the TWU. Once you have a government that governs in accordance with the benefits to consumers and citizens and not trade union tsars you are able to engage in this kind of reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government will encourage new entrants into the distribution market, some of which have already indicated and have already commenced. We will be encouraging state and local governments who have control of planning requirements to give access to new entrants who can come into the market and provide reform and restructuring in relation to the retail end of the market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8241">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also disposed towards removing the application of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act once oil companies, distributors and retailers reach agreement on a new oil code and an appropriate code of conduct. We expect that the parties will enter into negotiations to achieve such an outcome over the next 12 months. The Department of Industry, Science and Tourism will work with industry participants to address concerns about an oil code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note in passing that concerns about abuse of market power in relation to distributors and franchisees is already being considered by the House of Representatives fair trading inquiry, and we await the outcome of that. This is comprehensive structural reform. This is major deregulation in the petroleum industry. This stands in stark contrast to 13 years of inaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard earlier one of Labor's imputative spokesmen on Treasury matters asking why we would not agree to a Labor plan. There is one simple reason: there is no Labor plan. You would have thought, if there had been such a plan in 13 years, that we might have seen one piece of legislation. You would have thought, if there had been such a plan in 13 years, that we might have seen one press release. You would have thought that in 13 years, if there had been such a plan, we might have had one announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here are people who have luxuriated in 13 years of nothingness who suddenly find after an election that they had a plan, a plan which they did not even know about. I doubt whether the remaining part of the front bench has heard of it either. Here are people who, after 13 years of failed inaction, have cobbled together some kind of smokescreen to try to divert a government which after nine months has done what they were incapable of doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have announced major structural reform. It is in accordance with recommendations from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. It will unleash new competitive forces in the industry, and that has the opportunity to deliver to consumers. This is a new deal for motorists, and this is the government that will deliver it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comment that the Prime Minister made this morning, and I saw it, was that the government has laid down a plan to balance the budget over a three-year period.

This is an opposition which has failed to come to terms with its electoral defeat. This is the born to rule school. They were in office for 13 years. They failed to come to terms with their defeat.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question and her interest in this matter, as have other honourable members expressed an interest, in particular, the member for Kooyong. In the budget we announced that after 50 consultations in any 12-month period with a psychiatrist we would reduce the rebate by 50 per cent. The college of psychiatrists put to the government that this will cause a problem with a small number of people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had discussions with the college and my department has had discussions with the college. We have come to an agreement that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will accommodate these people. There are three small groups of people who may actually need more than 50 consultations a year. There are about 2,500 people seeing a consultant psychiatrist more than 50 times a year. We expect about 200 of those only will need additional treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The college of psychiatrists has agreed that people who fall into the category of border line personality disorder, eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, or one of the three following psychiatric illnesses that have resulted from severe sexual or personal abuse&mdash;dysthymia, substance related disorders or somatisation&mdash;may qualify for additional treatments. In addition, the person will have been required to have had failed treatment in the past and, secondly, at an initial consultation display at least serious symptoms as are defined in the global assessment of functional scale which is contained in the DSM4, the generally accepted international schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will mean that those small number of people who may benefit from additional intensive psychiatry will be able to get it. In addition, the college of psychiatrists has agreed to state that it is generally inappropriate for intensive long-term psychiatric treatment outside hospital to exceed 220 visits per year. This will assist the Health Insurance Commission to police inappropriate psychiatric treatment, something that it has had very great difficulty in doing in the past. Accreditation of psychoanalysts within the college of psychiatrists will take place, and eventually the new item numbers for additional treatments will be restricted to psychiatrists with such accreditation. This will be a small number of psychiatrists, perhaps no more than 50 or 60.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this means for the budget is that more than 90 per cent of the savings we sought to achieve will be achieved. We will have much tighter psychiatric treatment in Australia. We will now have the Health Insurance Commission with the power to tackle the rorts, something it has never had before. People who have genuine, well&hyphen;defined psychiatric problems that need this therapy will be able to get it and, hopefully, GPs will have a bit easier <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8243"> time trying to get their patients in to see a psychiatrist; one of the biggest complaints I get.</PARA>

Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition again that, under the telecommunications regime that we are putting in place, there is a guarantee that people will not pay higher charges than they do now. There is a guarantee of greater competition. I also remind the Leader of the Opposition that all his noisy protestations to the contrary cannot disguise the fact that much of the communications regime that is now before the Senate was modelled on an exposure draft that was released by the member for Dobell as the minister for communications in the former government. Included in that comment is the very device to which the Leader of the Opposition draws attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These questions cannot disguise the fact that, in the other place, the Labor Party has voted against not only the largest environmental initiative that any government has proposed since the end of World War II but also an investment of $250 million in telecommunications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every time the Leader of the Opposition asks me a question about telecommunications <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the bush, it gives me an opportunity to remind him and to remind people who live in the rural and regional areas of Australia that the Liberal and National parties want to help their telecommunications to be world class, 21st century, state of the art&mdash;and the Labor Party wants to oppose that. The Liberal and National parties want to make a great capital investment in the environment&mdash;and the Labor Party wants to stop that. The Liberal and National parties have in mind a 21st century that is built on high quality communications technology and proper protection of our environment&mdash;and the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats are disinterested in both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can do no better in concluding this answer than to draw on some remarks that were made by Alan Ramsey in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> this morning, a journalist who occasionally gives me a bit stick as he does those who sit opposite. He said, in effect, in his article that the world prize for being a bad loser in politics has got to go to the Labor Party on the subject of Telstra. He quite rightly reminded all of us that for 13 years the Labor Party made an art form of saying one thing about privatisation at an election and doing the exact opposite after.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer to the difficulties faced by primary producers in my electorate of Parkes and across many other areas of Australia arising from the prolonged impact of drought on their farm cash flows. Minister, what is the government doing to help alleviate the strain on farmers from exceptional drought circumstances? Does the government's action acknowledge that it can take an extended lead time to recover the farm financial position even after drought has broken?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8245" SPEAKER="Anderson, John, MP" NAMEID="4K4" ELECTORATE="Gwydir" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Primary Industries and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and would certainly acknowledge that he and many others in this place have seen their constituents suffer from the enormous problems of drought, coupled with low commodity prices and high interest rates in recent years. So he has a real interest in this question of exceptional drought and how people and rural communities in general are going to recover from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say at the outset that on coming to government we implemented a complete and thorough review process for the rural adjustment scheme. We continue to work with the states to overhaul and implement a comprehensive drought policy and to make sure that the two are properly related to one another. I am delighted with the level of interest and the number of submissions that are coming forward in relation to the work that the review team is undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the meantime, the coalition recognised that there would be many farmers and farm families out there who would have a very bleak Christmas this year in those areas where drought declarations were revoked on 11 June, following some decent seasonal breaks at last. There is a clear understanding on this side of the House that rain does not translate to a quick cash flow. The reality is that under the previous arrangement many hard&hyphen;pressed families would have had assistance, without <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which they could not carry on, withdrawn from today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to this very urgent and serious problem the Prime Minister, the President of the National Farmers Federation and I paid a visit to Queensland. We went to Winton and Clermont. We talked with many people up there including the Premier of Queensland, Rob Borbidge. We have allocated an additional $81.5 million to extend drought relief payments for the period under which people are supported from six months to 12 months after exceptional circumstances revocation so that they can recover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a real aid. Many farm families have been quite emotional in their expressions of gratitude over this, reflecting the extraordinary stress and pressure that they are feeling. It is a real aid to those families trying to maintain their business. It is a real aid too to those rural communities as they seek to recover from the devastation that they have experienced in recent times, particularly for the pastoral industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The beef and wool industries are in a mess. The wool industry is now suffering from a very serious problem of lack of demand for quality fibres, particularly in the Western world, arising largely out of flat economies in Europe. The beef industry is reeling from overproduction in the US and from real problems in terms of European and other consumption being down because of BSE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That $81.5 million is on top of an additional $90 million found in June&mdash;all new coalition funding. When you couple it with three interest rate cuts since we came to government&mdash;worth around $90 million each to the farm sector if fully passed on&mdash;you really are looking at a very substantial improvement in the bottom line for Australia's hard&hyphen;pressed farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Couple that with further achievements in reviving the heartland policy and some 40&hyphen;odd major policy proposals that have been fully implemented or are well down the road to implementation. It is a very proud record. The Prime Minister has just referred to a couple of the achievements. They will make a real difference to rural Australia, that vitally important part of our social and economic <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8246"> fabric so badly damaged after 13 years of neglect. We are getting on with the job of giving them a future again.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, let us go back over it. First of all, there was no deficit&mdash;do you recall that? In fact, the budget was balanced. That is what you said originally. Then there was a deficit and you were going to support it being balanced over three years. You then supported a balanced budget but you opposed every measure that would get it there. Now your shadow Treasurer is complaining that there is a deficit again. It is very hard to keep up with the twists and turns in opposition policy, because essentially you have not done the work to work things out, have you? You have not taken a position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Leader of the Opposition, you are unable to discipline your front bench. It was obvious. You are from the right wing of the Labor Party. It is your job to rein in the left wing. And what do you do? You have got the member for Jagajaga out there on nursing homes. You have got the member for Hotham <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wanting to preserve tax rorts in R&amp;D syndicates. He is running around Melbourne promising to keep the R&amp;D syndicates. We are onto you. We know exactly what you are up to. We know why you want R&amp;D tax syndicates. What is your answer for unemployment? To put the unemployed into tax syndicates? Do you think that will help them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could at least be supporting fiscal consolidation in relation to tax rorts. In fact, the December quarter ACCI Westpac survey reported that business confidence remains firm; a rebound in the September quarter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction in interest rates which occurred today&mdash;that was another part of the question by the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;was announced by the Reserve Bank of Australia in its release of today's date.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KV5">Mr NEVILLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Minister, you will recall at the time of the last election the Howard government committed itself to fundamental reform of aviation, undoubtedly one of Australia's most vital industries. Can the minister inform the House of the government's progress and achievements in meeting those commitments since taking office?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8247" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hinkler, who takes a very great interest in aviation matters. It is a very important part of his local community's economy. There was, in the build-up to the last election, tremendous concern out in the community about issues relating to the aviation industry. To see why, one only has to go back to who was in charge of aviation at the time&mdash;the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, known by his colleagues in the Labor Party as Dangerman. Dangerman was in charge of aviation in Australia. Is it any wonder, therefore, that there were some public concerns about it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of that, the coalition in opposition developed a very substantial aviation policy, which I am very pleased to be able to report to the House. We are in the process of fulfilling that speedily, effectively and fairly. We have designed all of our policies to build a safer, more competitive and more reliable aviation industry that can cope with the enormous growth potential that exists for aviation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the highlights in our aviation policy, being released over the last little while, is the finalisation of the single aviation market. Those of us who have taken an interest in aviation over the last few years will remember that the former government talked about developing a single aviation market with New <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8248"> Zealand but when push came to shove they could not go with the flow. They could not stand up to the heat and they backed out of the particular agreement which had been agreed with the New Zealand government. When we came into government, we renegotiated a single aviation market and it came into effect on 1 November this year. It is interesting to note how significant a reform this is. The December issue of an aviation industry magazine states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only is the single aviation market the most important aviation event in the last 20 years; it is also arguably the most far reaching economic development in the evolution of Australia-New Zealand relations.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to praise the coalition government's implementation of that single aviation market agreement with New Zealand which, incidentally, created a market worth $5,000 million a year, transporting 31 million passengers a year&mdash;a very substantial market indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, we have entered into the sale of a number of our FAC airports. Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports are for sale. Adelaide will be put on sale next year. As part of that process, we have announced that landing charges at those airports will actually reduce, under our CPI minus X regime. We announced what the X factor was just the other day. Landing charges at those new privatised airports will go down&mdash;in Melbourne by 15 per cent, in Brisbane by 17 per cent and in Perth by 20 per cent&mdash;over the next five years under our new regime. Compare that to the proposal put forward by the former Labor government, which would have seen landing charges increase by 14 per cent per annum over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, we have had a substantial increase in international aviation capacity with other countries. It has increased under our negotiating regime by some 13 per cent over the last few months. For example, when we came into office I discovered that we had only one flight per week to China, one of the largest countries in the world and one of the fastest growing economies&mdash;an important tourist destination for Australia and for our tourism industry. We increased that under our negotiating regime from one flight per week to ultimately 13 flights per week. We have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increased the air service agreements with Indonesia by some 40-odd per cent in the last couple of months. Dr Haryanto, the minister of communications in Indonesia, who handles transport matters, is here in Australia today negotiating further benefits for both Australia and Indonesia.</PARA>

We then come to the other major area of the Labor Party's failings in aviation policy; that is, Sydney airport. Sydney airport was cause of considerable concern for people living in Sydney because of the very incompetent and dishonest management of the third runway at Sydney airport. We have reduced the amount of public concern over that issue simply by implementing our policy of sharing the noise. We have opened the east-west runway. Aircraft movements to the north of Sydney airport have now dropped from 50 per cent to some 33 per cent. Thirty-three per cent of those aircraft movements are now going to the north instead of 50 per cent under Labor's management&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr JULL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some very real progress has been made and I think we are delivering some very positive outcomes for the taxpayers. There was a major change in DAS's focus. We initiated that in the lead&hyphen;up to the budget when I announced that there will be a number of strategic reviews of the DAS commercial businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcomes of those reviews were announced in the budget when the government decided to sell or to restructure 12 DAS businesses: Asset Services, the DAS Centre for Environmental Management, DAS Distribution, DAS Interiors, Works Australia and the Australian Operational Support Services are being offered for sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale process is being conducted at arm's length from the businesses by the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Office of Asset Sales within the Finance portfolio, and that is well advanced. There has been very strong interest from the private sector. The advertising, short&hyphen;listing and selection of the successful purchasers will occur early in the new year, with the sale of the businesses expected to be finalised by the end of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Five of the businesses will be retained in government ownership because they provide important public interest functions. They are the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories, the Australian Government Publishing Service, the Australian Surveying and Land Information Group, the Australian Valuation Office and Removals Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, the government believes that these businesses should also be reformed to ensure that their programs are delivered more efficiently and more effectively. To this end, their commercial activities will be market tested. For example, in relation to the AGPS, proposals have been sought from the private sector in relation to 12 activities, including core parliamentary and government printing and security printing of such items as passports and citizenship certificates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, Auslig's commercial activities in the areas of geographic management information systems and consultancies, field surveying, customised mapping and navigation services are also to be market tested. Removals Australia, which performs a valuable and profitable whole of government procurement function, is being retained within government ownership, but from 1 July next year it will have to compete on a fully competitive neutral basis and be exposed to a full taxation regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just last week I announced that up to $100 million worth of business will be let out to private sector removalists. The government has also sought proposals on the sale or refinancing of Dasfleet and we expect to reach a decision on that before the end of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale and market testing of a wide range of commercial activities will create major opportunities for the private sector, and especially for small and medium enterprises, allowing them to gain further access to a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8250"> government market which is valued at some $450 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also announced in the budget significant changes to the way in which the government's real property portfolio is to be managed. Fundamentally, the government believes it should own property only where there is a real economic benefit from public ownership or where there is a strong public interest argument for doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To this end, a Commonwealth Property Committee, comprising both public and private sector expertise, was formed in August 1996 to review the Commonwealth's commercial estate against the Commonwealth's property principles adopted by the government earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do anticipate there will be some significant property divestment and that will be undertaken over the next few years. Frankly, that is going to deliver some very significant savings to the taxpayer and some real business opportunities in the private sector. Already, 11 Commonwealth properties around Australia have been earmarked for sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government is outsourcing its property management functions and that will give us an estimated saving of $4 million.

Prior to the election, the coalition promised as one of its major priorities to deliver a new deal for small business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The government can be proud of its remarkable list of achievements in just nine months. In our policy area of a new deal for small business, we certainly have delivered. We have progressed a favourable business climate; responsible economic management has lowered interest rates and given a better deal for small business. There have been three interest rate falls in just five months&mdash;a remarkable achievement that directly benefits all small businesses and consumers. In the capital gains tax rollover area, the Prime Minister a short while ago explained to the House that we went further than our policy commitment. While it has been stated before, it is worth quoting again the article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS>  from Robert Gottliebsen&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The small business capital&hyphen;gains&hyphen;tax rollover relief is the most significant change made to taxation in Australia for decades.</PARA>
<PARA>It is something you landed small business with and we have fixed it for them. In addition, the small business summit was well attended by state and local government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, I will be meeting with state ministers to discuss the Small Business Deregulation Task Force report that was given to the Prime Minister on 1 November. We have instigated a House of Representatives inquiry into fair trading, an issue that small business has been very worried about. So in the small business area we have certainly delivered. After 13 years of being ignored by the previous government we have at least listened to their concerns&mdash;and they appreciate that. That quote is just one of many from small business organisations supporting the initiatives of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of consumer affairs we have taken steps to foster and encourage self&hyphen;regulation to give consumers a new and better option in this area. We have developed draft principles and guidelines for service charters. In the area of service charters for government the Prime Minister personally wrote to me and asked me to take charge of service charters for government services, something that your mob never proposed to do.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Hughes for her question. I am delighted to inform the House, particularly members from wine growing areas, that CSIRO researchers have achieved a scientific breakthrough of international significance with the creation of what may well be the world's first genetically modified grapevine. The vine, which paves the way for major gains in productivity and quality for Australia's $650 million wine, grape and dried fruits industries was developed at CSIRO's Division of Horticulture in Adelaide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has been involved in a neck and neck race with France and America to make this discovery. As a result of the breakthrough, we will be able to create grapevines of enhanced flavour, improved colour development and increased disease resistance. The discovery represents a very large gamble that has paid off for the Australian wine industry. The industry has invested in the project, recognising the potential returns, even though the chances of success when they started out on this long journey of scientific discovery were low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Today's announcement coincides with consumer and environmental concerns expressed on Channel 9's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> program last night dealing with gene technology, or genetic engineering. Last week the first shipment of genetically modified foodstuff arrived in Australia in the form of Round Up ready soya beans which have been altered to resist herbicides. I would like to assure consumer groups and the community at large that the soya beans have been approved only after the most stringent guidelines laid down and enforced by the Austral ian Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee, GEMAC, as well as the United States Food and Drug Administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The soya beans pose no health risk to consumers. Nevertheless, the government is addressing a number of issues concerning the regulation of gene technology and labelling of gene technology food products in Australia to ensure that the industry has a clear assessment and approval process and that consumers can have full confidence in the safety of products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was just looking for the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;running out to get some new questions, because you have exhausted your supply. They had a quick tactics meeting, an emergency gathering, asking, `What can we do to keep question time going?' It just goes to show that the government is not in the slightest intimidated by or scared of your questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In drawing to a conclusion, can I say that, under existing and proposed guidelines, the public has nothing to fear from genetic technology but, instead, can look forward to very significant benefits in human and animal health, food production and agriculture because the technology offers very considerable improvement in agricultural yields, higher quality products, increased resistance to disease and pests, and reduced use of environmentally harmful chemicals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been concerned for some time about the Carr government's approach to forest policy in New South Wales.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of members of the government, including the member for Paterson, the member for Page, the member for Cowper and the member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro, have expressed concerns to me that, by its pre&hyphen;emptive process, the Carr government is putting at risk not only the jobs of timber workers on the eve of Christmas but the Carr government, by its pre&hyphen;emptive behaviour, is also threatening to undermine an agreement that was originally forged between the former Keating government and the various state governments of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate that there are some for whom bringing our traditions with us into the new parliament is akin to bringing constitutional baggage with which they disagree. I think that was the attitude of some&mdash;but not the attitude of all&mdash;when that decision was made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there will be some consideration of the matter, and it will be a detailed consideration. There will be a further discussion in our party room about the matter and, in due course, we will say more about it.</PARA>

Part of the problem that the right honourable member for New England has alluded to is the fact that this chamber is so large that from time to time that may be difficult. I am just wondering, Mr Speaker, whether it is possible to look at some other means whereby one can ascertain the question being divided on on entry into the chamber to be able to make a decision.</PARA></QUESTION>

<TIME.STAMP>(4.11 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over two weeks have passed since the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) announced that the government intended to privatise Australian National and to sell its share in National Rail. It is not because of any lack of seriousness or regard for the issue that the opposition has chosen not to raise this for debate in this chamber until the second week of sittings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8266">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very simple reason why we have chosen to do that, that is, to give the minister an opportunity to do the right thing and to make a ministerial statement in the parliament, as he should have done and has failed to do, with respect to this very serious issue. He chose to announce it on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, but to treat this parliament with contempt by not even coming in and making a ministerial statement about a very substantial proposal which was not previously mentioned by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the content of the proposal, it is no wonder that he has chosen to do this. We have a decision to privatise Australia's National Rail Corporation and Australian National based on a report that the government refuses to release, based on one year's bad figures that the minister is deliberately distorting and grossly inflating to further his case and, in the case of National Rail, based on no bad figures but based on National Rail continuing to perform as it was originally intended to perform when it was established by the former government and gradually moving towards commercial viability within five years and towards break&hyphen;even unsubsidised circumstances. National Rail is broadly on track to achieve this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the government has only been able to produce one justification, namely, bad figures, for its proposal to privatise Australian National gives an absolute indication that this is completely unjustified when you look at the situation with National Rail, which is on track to commercial viability. It is also a decision based, I might add, on no consultation of any great substance. The Public Transport Union, the main representatives of the workers in Australian National and National Rail, was given a mere 15 minutes before the government's committee in discussions on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a decision conceived in secrecy and deceit. It has been gestated in unrelenting hostility to the public sector and the rail industry, and given birth to in a shimmer of distortions and lies. It is interesting to look at coalition policy, where we see no mention of privatisation of Australian National or National Rail, no mention of removing the subsidy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that has been there for some considerable time and long before the previous Labor government was in office, and no mention of destroying jobs or services in the rail industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition policy was not exactly a long document but it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will establish a national interstate passenger rail service in partnership with the States, linking all interstate passenger rail services. Australian National will be given the task of operating this new and innovative service designed to increase rail patronage on a fully commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian National has been poorly treated under the Labor Government. The Coalition is committed to providing AN with a future through such means as the interstate passenger initiative which will increase AN's business base and promote job security for its employees through policies designed to increase the use of rail, utilising an under&hyphen;utilised resource.   </PARA>
<PARA>How hollow these words now sound. Is the government giving AN a future? Is it increasing its business? Is it giving job security, a promise to the workers of AN? Definitely not. It is dismantling it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear even today again more unctuousness about previous decisions of the former government with respect to privatisation&mdash;about Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;and claims that these were not taken to the electorate, at the very same time that this government is doing precisely that by proposing to privatise Australian National and its share of National Rail when it has made no commitment to the electorate along those lines and, quite to the contrary, has committed itself to improve and increase Australian National and its business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September, the minister was forced against his wishes to release the Brew report executive summary in the Senate. This recommended the wholesale dismantling of Australian National but not of National Rail&mdash;merely to put National Rail on a commercial basis, which is where it is due to end up in any event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it was released the minister said, `Don't assume that we'll do any of these things that were recommended; the report is to the government, not of the government. And in any event it's all Labor's fault; they did nothing, they sat there, they were asleep <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8267"> at the wheel, they didn't take any decisions or action to fix the problem.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the same day we got a press release from Australian National indicating it was already starting the process of selling off its core businesses. So on 11 September we heard from the minister, `Labor did nothing, Labor was asleep at the wheel,' but on 12 September, when he is confronted with the draconian proposals to sell the businesses of Australian National, we heard a totally different story: `No, that was all Labor's decisions. That was all Labor's fault, nothing to do with us. Labor's decisions had these in train.' But the lie in this was exposed on the following day, on 13 September&mdash;he had a bad run during these three days&mdash;when the minister's letter of 15 August to the chairman of AN, Mr Jack Smorgon, was tabled, indicating that he had given specific instructions for the sell&hyphen;off to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, on 26 September, the real agenda behind the Brew report became clear. The real role of the consultant, Mr Brew himself, was revealed, because at the same time as he was acting as a consultant to the government, advising about the future of the rail industry in Australia, advising about what should be done with Australian National&mdash;how the government should treat the future of rail in this country&mdash;he was lining himself up to be a consultant to the main bidder to buy Australian National. At the same time as he is advising the government to sell Australian National, he is also getting into bed with the main consortium that is lining up to buy the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of that, we now have a completely tainted report. We cannot read the full report, but it is fully tainted, because the person who has done the report, at the same time as he was forming his conclusions, clearly had in mind, `Where can I profit as a result of government decisions with respect to the future of Australian National and National Rail?' Answer: as a consultant to somebody in the private sector who might buy some or all of the businesses that are going to be up for sale. So we had a consultant advising the government, `Go ahead and sell all these things; beauty, I'll be able to get in there at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the carve&hyphen;up, I'll be able to get my share of the action later on down the track.' Finally, as I indicated, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program the minister announced that all of it would be sold. He has made a decision effectively to fatten up the assets for a fire sale by restating the government's responsibility for various liabilities such as the AN debt and endeavouring to take on board to the government all existing liabilities for Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, all that is doing is shifting from one accounting heading to another a set of liabilities that the government already has. The government has those liabilities anyway. The minister said, `This is a $2 billion reform package.' Some journalists, unfortunately, have chosen not to look behind the statement and see it for the absolute lie that it is. It is a restatement of existing liabilities, a restatement of certain commitments already in the budget and carry&hyphen;on commitments from the former government, albeit with substantial reductions in funding&mdash;such as the former Track Australia, $161 million&mdash;and some very unlikely contingencies, such as $50 million for environmental cleanup.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My information from Australian National is that that figure within AN was based on an assessment of what it would cost to do a decontamination of every single AN site. In other words, it can only have meaning if the entire rail network and the entire business of AN is actually closed down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see the superannuation figure there&mdash;$580 million. It is a complete fake because AN has been making superannuation payments to the federal government, into consolidated revenue. So it technically has part of its superannuation unfunded, but money has gone into consolidated revenue on a monthly basis. That $580 million covering superannuation is simply an accounting device. It is a complete fraud and the whole $2 billion figure is a complete fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is an even bigger fraud is the claim that AN had a $250 million loss for 1995&hyphen;96. Roughly $140 million of that loss actually consists of one&hyphen;off asset revaluations. Yes, that is an issue, but it is dramatically different from comparing operating revenues and operating expenditure, which is the real issue <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8268"> about future bleeding of the business. The minister, Mr Sharp, has grossly misrepresented the situation; again, he refused to tell the people of Australia, particularly people with an interest in AN&mdash;those workers, those people who depend on the services of AN&mdash;what the real story is, in order to justify what is basically an ideological attempt to get rail out of the public sector, to give a few mates in the private sector a bit of a free kick, have a bit of a fire sale and get the subsidies away from the federal budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he has not actually revealed is that the operating result for AN for 1995&hyphen;96, I am informed, will come in slightly better than what the Brew report predicted. He has also indicated that AN and NR may be sold in bits; in other words, cherry&hyphen;picking may occur. There is no guarantee of existing services being maintained. That was revealed in his answer to my question the other day in the House. There is no guarantee that things like the workshops will not be asset stripped by competitors who will simply buy them up, close them down, take out the assets and look forward to a situation where there is one less major competitor in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing about obligations being imposed on new private owners to maintain services; no guarantees about the future of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacifi</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">c</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ghan</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Overland</EMPHASIS>; no guarantees about the future route for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>. People in Broken Hill and other parts of inland New South Wales are very concerned about these issues. But there are no guarantees, beyond the sale, about the future of these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no guarantees about the future of the grain services in South Australia, which South Australian wheat farmers depend on. There are no guarantees about the future of Tasrail and the freight services which help to underpin the economic viability of a range of industries and industrial activities in Tasmania, such as the Fingal Valley coalmines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Particularly, there are no guarantees about jobs. We have heard some pretty contradictory statements from the minister about jobs. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, courtesy of some questions from Laurie Oakes, he was asked, `Will this necessarily mean job losses?' The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> answer from the minister was, `No, it won't necessarily mean job losses.' On the same day he had a letter going out to all Australian National employees which said, `Further reductions in employment will inevitably result from the sale process.' So on television, to the Australian people, he says, `No, there won't necessarily be job losses,' but to the employees he says, `Sorry, yes there will be.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can guarantee there will be job losses. What about the workers in Launceston? I visited there last week. The minister has not been seen there. Indeed, the local member, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), has not been seen there. They are very worried about their job futures, as are the workers in South Australia, whose shop stewards I spoke to again yesterday at some length.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no explanation given for selling National Rail, which, as I have indicated, has substantially moved towards its target for commercial viability set by the former government. The interstate freight deficit has fallen from $350 million to $50 million, based on the evidence given by the minister's own department to a Senate committee on 19 September and vindicated by National Rail itself on 22 October to the same committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a $300 million reduction in the deficit on that side of the ledger. On the other side, there has been a deterioration, but nothing to the extent that the minister indicated&mdash;nothing of that magnitude. The overall picture is still an overall $200 million&hyphen;plus improvement in the total rail deficit picture over those four or five years. National Rail is on track to commercial viability, where it will have no subsidies after five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister&mdash;this gives an indication of what the real story is&mdash;was fronting up to the annual general meeting of National Rail only a few weeks ago demanding a $1 million extraordinary dividend out of them. Far from them being in financial strife, the government is trying to milk extra money out of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government are providing only $20 million of their so-called $2 billion package, which amounts to about one per cent in real expenditure, for regional adjustment. That is about one year's wages bill at Port Augusta. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8269"> It is a drop in the ocean with respect to the economic impact that will occur at Port Augusta. It will not help the loss of heavy engineering capacity in Adelaide. It will not pay for the cost of increased road usage and increased road costs in Tasmania, which will ultimately lead to double the costs. The deficit on Tasrail in the last two years is now at the lowest it has been for 10 years. The last two years in Tasrail have been the best of the last 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regional adjustment fund will not cover the road damage that results, it will not cover assistance to inland New South Wales communities that lose their services, and there is no mention anywhere of the fact that the former Labor government's labour market adjustment programs have been abolished, which 1,200 AN workers who were previously retrenched benefited from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's attack on the record of the former government with respect to jobs is equally fallacious. The loss of jobs in AN in the last 13 years has been mirrored in every rail system in the country for the same reasons&mdash;new technology, work practices and improvements in productivity. That is where they have come from. Citing examples of New Zealand and other countries around the world to justify what the minister is doing is equally ludicrous. New Zealand Rail does well because road charges are three or four times higher than they are in Australia, so the playing field is radically different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look around the world, you see, for example, Amtrak in the United States. Amtrak long distance passenger rail is subsidised by the American government to the tune of over $1 billion per year. The picture is the same throughout Canada and throughout the United Kingdom. Rail throughout the world is subsidised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key thing in all of this is a minister who is economical with the truth. He has tried to claim that Labor's actions led to his decision to sell off AN. He has tried to claim that the losses AN are incurring for 1995-96 are $250 million when they are in fact way below that. And he said on TV that this will not necessarily mean job losses when he was telling the workers the direct opposite.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a pattern that is recurring throughout the minister's statements because he likes to leave out key facts when it suits him. He is very well named, not because he is sharp as in intelligent, not because he is sharp as in bright, but because he is sharp as in practices, sharp as in conduct, sharp as in card sharp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This privatisation plan is purely ideological. It is designed to get rid of a subsidy on the budget. It is designed to get the government out of the rail industry. It is based on one year's bad figures that are nowhere near as bad as the government suggests and it is based on a secret report that the government refuses to release. The Labor Party will fight this all the way in the Senate and in the Senate committee. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been fascinating. We have had two weeks, as the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) points out, for the Labor Party to mount their withering attack on this particular subject. Indeed, we have had to ask ourselves questions on this very subject in order to get up in the House. There was only one question from the Labor Party in the whole of this fortnight whereupon they asked about the AN reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It took us, on behalf of the government, to ask questions of ourselves to get the issue up in the parliament in the first place. Even today in the House, where we had 24, 25 or possibly 26 questions&mdash;the Labor Party ran out of questions because they did not think question time would go as long as it did today&mdash;they had plenty of opportunity to raise questions about this subject in the House, but they did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the Labor Party has not raised this as a topical subject that they believe is of political value to themselves is simply that this is a political embarrassment to the Labor Party. The Labor Party is politically embarrassed over the way AN and NR have been managed during their 13 years of office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I spoke to some people who worked for AN just the other day in Adelaide. Indeed, it was a most illuminating exercise. The first thing they say to me is that the reason AN is in the problem it is in today is the previous Labor government's decision to set up the National Rail Corporation the way it did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason they say that is that when the National Rail Corporation was set up in the early 1990s National Rail was given two&hyphen;thirds of AN's business. AN had to give it a lot of its rolling stock, locomotives and other equipment free of charge. AN had to give over two&hyphen;thirds of its business to the National Rail Corporation&mdash;plus its locos, plus its rolling stock, plus a lot of other assets&mdash;without any charge or cost going to NR and without any revenue coming to AN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AN was left with the debt on those locos, the debt on that rolling stock, the debt on the assets that they handed over. So NR got the revenue from all of this equipment and AN had to pay the bill. NR got two&hyphen;thirds of AN's business and AN was left with all the infrastructure and costs to bear. That is the thing that people who work for AN say was the problem they had to work with, a problem created by the previous Labor government. That is why this is a very embarrassing issue for Labor. AN's death knell was struck with the foundation of the National Rail Corporation by the previous Labor government. That is why this is embarrassing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also embarrassing for the Labor Party because during its time in office 7,000 people who worked for AN lost their jobs. Here we are today dealing with an MPI in which the Labor Party is railing about the possible loss <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of jobs within AN, yet 7,000 jobs were lost at AN during the 13 years of a Labor government&mdash;under Labor's management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne he said, `Those job losses? They were good job losses because that is what everybody else was doing. Any job losses in the future will obviously be bad.' I can assure the House that there will not be anything like those sorts of job losses in AN or NR in the future, because it is this government's proposal to grow those businesses, to make them more efficient and to reduce the debt load, the debt burden, that those businesses have had to suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to consider what the previous Labor government could have done, had they chosen to try to fix the problems of AN. AN's problem was that it lumbered with enormous debts, debts that have a commercial value of around $1,100 million. AN had to pay the bill for those debts. That was one of the major problems that AN suffered from. What this government has done is exactly what the PTU representatives asked us to do when we discussed these matters with them. The PTU representatives said, `If there is one thing you can do for AN, it is to relieve it of its debts. If you relieve AN of its debts, then AN's problems will be, to a fair degree, resolved because it is the debt that weighs us down so much.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of our announcement on rail reform, this new coalition government will be removing all of the debts and liabilities of AN: taking over its debt, paying out any possible redundancy commitments that are within the labour force at AN, paying out all of the superannuation commitments within AN and dealing with all of the environmental problems&mdash;if they are tidied up properly, to the value of about $50 million. We are taking over all of the debts and liabilities of AN in order to ensure that AN, under a new owner, has a real future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is something that the previous Labor government could have done. They could have done precisely that, if they had wanted to fix the problems of AN, but they chose not to do it during their 13 years of office. Instead, what the previous Labor government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8271"> chose to do was to mislead the people who work for AN, as they did in the run&hyphen;up to the last election when the former Minister for Transport and the former Prime Minister visited the workshops at AN and told them that everything was sweet, everything was hunky&hyphen;dory. `Vote for us and you'll have a future,' they said. Well, their business plan that the former Minister for Transport and the former Minister for Finance, now the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), had signed off on had agreed secretly to strike out 972 jobs. In the Labor business plan it had been agreed that 972 jobs had to go, at the very time the Labor Prime Minister and the Labor transport minister were down there telling them that everything was sweet; they had no worries at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go to a couple of the points that the honourable member for Melbourne made in his withering attack. The PTU, he said, got only 15 minutes with us. That is incorrect. There were several members of our committee there and they had a much longer time than that. They had considerable contact with me and members of the government over the months that led up to that decision. We had consistent contact from the PTU. We listened to their advice and, in many cases, we have accepted their advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that the honourable member for Melbourne made in his address was that the National Rail Corporation is on the road to profitability and it is only a Labor government with its policies that would have seen that happen&mdash;or words to that effect. National Rail Corporation is not on the road to profitability. In the September quarter, it was $10.8 million down on its budgeted revenues.The chief executive officer at the time of announcing the September quarter results said that revenue for NR for the whole of the financial year would be something like $45 million to $50 million below budget forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is this a business on its way to profitability? Is this a business that does not depend on government subsidies for its existence? The truth of it is that NR gets $25 million of government subsidies in 1995&hyphen;96. It will get subsidies again in the current financial year. Not only that but NR receives goods and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> services, assets, from other rail operators at below cost. Companies such as AN are forced under the arrangements Labor put in place to provide services&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, finished under our initiative. We no longer require AN to provide those services free of charge to National Rail, contrary to the arrangements that you had in place. That occurred as a consequence of some negotiation that John Brew himself was involved in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other attempt that was made by the honourable member for Melbourne in his address was to slur the good name of Mr John Brew. It is worth while pointing out to the House that Mr Brew is not involved with any of the people who are being considered&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="TANNER" NAMEID="YU5">

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He didn't get sprung at all. If you listen to Mr Brew, he will tell you that he had no arrangements with anybody and he informed me that he had no intention of making any arrangements with anybody. So it is quite a scurrilous thing for the honourable member for Melbourne to try to attack the reputation of Mr John Brew in his remarks just a few moments ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has announced a $2 billion package to try to resolve the problems of AN and to reform our rail system here in Australia. This package of reforms is in stark contrast to the death by a thousand cuts represented by the 7,000 job losses that Labor had under their 13 years of management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one and only question I can recall being asked by the member for Melbourne in the last fortnight was about whether there would be a guarantee of the maintenance of passenger and freight services. It is interesting to note Labor's track record on maintaining passenger and freight services during their 13 years of office when they had the management of AN. A long list of services was axed under their management. For example, passenger services: Adelaide to Victor Harbor&mdash;axed; Adelaide to Peterborough&mdash;axed; Adelaide to Broken Hill&mdash;axed; Adelaide to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8272"> Whyalla&mdash;axed; Adelaide to Mount Gambier&mdash;axed. Those are all passenger services.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="VAILE" NAMEID="SU5">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SU5">Mr Vaile</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who did that?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Labor did that during their 13 years of office, their 13 years of mismanagement. Let us see what happened with the freight services that AN operated during the 13 years of a Labor government. Services were withdrawn from rail lines to Mount Gambier, Loxton and Kapunda. In Tasmania, freight services were axed on the Mole Creek line and the Tonganah line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, a number of lines were technically closed during Labor's 13 years of mismanagement: the Millicent&hyphen;Snuggery line; the Snowtown&hyphen;Wallaroo line; the Mount Barker&hyphen;Victor Harbor line; the Kapunda&hyphen;Eudunda line; the Alawoona&hyphen;Paringa line; and the Karoonda&hyphen;Peebinga line. So Labor Party people have no credibility when get up on their feet and talk about possible job losses or reductions in passenger or freight services or closure of lines at AN and NR&mdash;because nobody has done it more than they did during their 13 years in office. Indeed, the whole purpose of our reforms is to boost rail in this country to give it a real future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell members of the House now that people who work for AN recognise that this announcement we have made gives them a solid future to work with&mdash;a future that they would not have got under Labor's mismanagement. Indeed, you ought to see some of the letters that I have received from various people who work for AN. Some of those letters are very complimentary indeed. If I could find them, I would read them out to you but I do not have them with me now. However, several letters have been written to me by people who work for AN saying, `At last somebody has grasped the nettle and had the courage to make some decisions to build a new future for AN and our career.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a number of those letters because they got sick and tired of the deception, the run&hyphen;down and the lack of interest by those people who ran this country in the form of a Labor government. There has been a tremendous response from people working for AN. Even in the media there has been a tremendous response. Editorials in newspapers <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Launceston Examiner</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a town where this decision affects them&mdash;have been very praiseworthy of what the government is doing. Look at the comments of the Mayor of Port Augusta, Joy Baluch, who said that this is a new turning point, a new opportunity. These are complimentary and positive responses from people who are affected more directly than anybody else by the decisions of this particular government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this government is proposing to give rail a real future. We believe that by bringing private sector investment into the rail system, as has been the case in a lot of other countries, rail will grow here in Australia. By setting up a national network of rail lines connecting our capital cities and allowing the private sector to operate on it, we believe there will be more freight on our rail system and, ultimately, more passengers than we have seen in the past. Evidence of that was just 48 hours ago when TNT and Toll Holdings agreed to a joint venture to put more freight onto rail under this government's initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is giving rail a real future for real jobs to be created in the rail industry in Australia, rather than the death by a thousand cuts that the former Labor government imposed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Railways have always played a vital role in the development of countries like Australia&mdash;countries with wide open spaces and many miles between settlements. In the development of Australia railways were vital for the transport of passengers and freight, for maintaining communication and for supporting jobs in regional areas which relied on them to bring people and goods into the area and to get the produce out of the district and to the market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8273"> They have also been vital though for industrial development in themselves: the manufacture and maintenance of rolling stock and engines; and the maintenance and laying of track. All of these provide jobs and funding for regional economies like Port Augusta and for areas like Islington in suburban Adelaide. They are also vital lifelines for towns along the route, such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS> through Broken Hill providing one of the only eco nomical links for many in our community between Perth and Sydney and also links for those rural communities across that Australian route. The same is true for towns along the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Overland</EMPHASIS> route between Adelaide and Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Railways have also been vital for the defence of our country. It is worth noting that it is only Labor which has provided a real and significant possibility for the Alice Springs to Darwin link, which not only has substantial advantages in trade in this country and for South Australia and the Northern Territory but also provides a real link to the north of Australia for the defence of Australia. The role of railways in the development of this country, be it trading or entrepreneurial activity, manufacturing, mining, agriculture or defence, has always been vital in all of those areas of national development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But while the times and the economies of scale and the technology and working practices in rail have changed, the whole notion of our rail network has had to change too. It continues to perform the same vital functions that it performed a century ago in the national development of Australia and which it will always perform in countries like this. But the last few decades have seen the rail system under some threat from the competition for passengers from the airline industry and the road transport industry which has sought to take freight and to undercut the rail system in Australia&mdash;in fact, to undermine the very economic basis of that rail network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only Labor has had the vision and this generation to look at the rail network and to seize the opportunity to build a viable national system with it. The Whitlam government of the early 1970s, for example, recognised the problems which rail faced and sought to overcome those shortcomings by building a national rail network that did not rely on the individual state governments and individual state ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The isolation which the state ownership provided for rail ensured that you could only have an effective intrastate network and that interstate networks were unnecessarily handicapped by that. The Whitlam government seized that opportunity. Unfortunately, not all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> states were agreeable to being part of that process but the states that did&mdash;South Australia and Tasmania&mdash;certainly benefited from that then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had the other states cooperated back then, 20 years ago, we would by now have had a much more viable national network. Whitlam offered the states a way out of their difficulties and provided the opportunity to build for South Australia and Tasmania. Victoria and New South Wales stayed outside the system and Australia has paid the price ever since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prime Minister Fraser did not continue this good work. Indeed, it was during this period that much of the foundation for our current problems was laid. For example, in the final year of the Fraser government, when another National Party minister held the position of Minister for Transport, the current value of the debt&mdash;if you look at the debt then in current dollar terms&mdash;was some $190 million, which certainly is within the ballpark of any current problems being faced by the rail network. It just shows you where much of that debt came from back in the late 1970s and early 1980s during the Fraser years.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="N36">Mr MARTYN EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, if you look back at those Fraser years, you will see where the debt that we are talking about now started from. That is where the initiative was lost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the last decade, in the period of the Hawke-Keating governments, Labor again faced up to the challenge of building a viable national rail network. I do not claim that all the decisions which were taken during that time were ideal. But the reality of the need to ensure state cooperation left us with no alternative but to take the unfortunate decision to split National Rail from AN. That created two organisations, one of which, unfortunately, carried a fair amount of lead in its saddle bags.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we had had the option then of building a single national network around a national rail organisation, then many of the difficulties which we now face may well have been avoided. However, it must be said that it has always been Labor which has taken the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8274"> national development approach to rail. It is Labor which negotiated agreements with the unions which resulted in some job losses&mdash;but not on the scale alleged by the minister&mdash;and which were needed then to ensure the viability of AN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, we also ensured that those who were voluntarily retrenched were compensated both financially and in terms of educational and retraining opportunities&mdash;educational opportunities which are being cruelly, savagely and harshly withdrawn from them by the minister and his government who are cutting costs in education across the board, cutting costs in training across the board and thereby condemning those AN workers who are no longer part of the structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, we imposed changes to work practices and required the adoption of new technologies. These were hard decisions for the work force to accept. As a frequent visitor to the Islington workshops&mdash;like my colleague the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) more recently as shadow minister&mdash;I have seen the dramatic changes to the work force, to productivity and to technology which those people have done a very good job in implementing. The workers accepted that challenge that was put before them by the Labor government. They understood the need for that challenge. It was negotiated at all times with the work force. They rose to that challenge. The response has been fantastic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen dramatic change in those rail industries, much more so than in most other industries. That was starting to lay the framework for an improvement to the financial position of Australian National and, of course, the commercial basis for national rail. They also understood the social contract which existed between the government of those days and the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the commitment to build and sustain the rail network, to build and sustain the regional development commitment and component which ensured major job opportunities at Port Augusta, at Islington and in the country towns along those national routes&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Overland</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ghan</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Pacific</EMPHASIS>. Our commitment to that development must be contrasted with that of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the new government. Certainly, it is far from their election commitments. I quote from an article in July 1995 in which Mr Sharp, who was then the coalition spokesman, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition is concerned that Australian National should have a viable future that not only assures its survival, but enables it to grow, bringing job opportunities to important rail centres such as those in the Grey electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition's intention to establish a separate company to own and maintain the rail track will also facilitate and encourage the entry of new participants . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition is committed to the continued and growing strength of rail transport and of Australian National in particular.</PARA>
<PARA>We see now 18 months later just how hollow those words were. Before the election it was okay to talk about the future of Australian National and the future of a national rail system. After the election we talk about a fire sale destroying the assets of Australian National by selling them off and abolishing the jobs. There will be a loss of 550 jobs in Port Augusta alone which will certainly destroy the local economy in the Iron Triangle and put the livelihood of those people at considerable threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those workshops are very much an important part of the regional economy of Australia. They provide jobs. They provide maintenance work. They inject funds into the whole economy. It is not only those people who work in the workshops but also the teachers, the people working in the service industries which are built around the workshops and the suppliers who provide the infrastructure for those workshops&mdash;they are all vital to the economy of regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional Australia has suffered enormously under this minister and under this government. Look at the pretence of a minister who claims the title of `Minister for Regional Development' but whose first act is to sack most of the staff in that department and to cancel the funding for that department&mdash;indeed, he virtually abolishes the department. I understand there are only some six people left in that office who service a minor function of advising the minister on regional development. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8275">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you can be the minister for regional development and preside over the demise of the department of regional development, if you can be the minister and preside over the withdrawal of $620 million from road funding from regions, if you can be the minister and wear the removal of telecommunications from regional Australia, if you can be the minister and wear the whole destruction of the Australian national rail system through its privatisation and disposal at fire sale prices, then you are not the Minister for Transport and Regional Development that I would expect because those things will destroy regional economies. They will destroy jobs in Port Augusta; they will destroy jobs in Islington; they will destroy jobs in towns along our great national rail routes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that, when it is all said and done, the fire sale recommended by Brew will go ahead and that great national railway network, which has been built in this country over decades and decades by the work force of this country, will be destroyed. It will be this minister supposedly for regional development who will have presided over it; it will be this minister supposedly in support of transport and a public sector transport basis who will have presided over that failure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He appears to have vacated his previous position, Minister. The member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) has given us an historical perspective of Labor's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> role in rail. I actually believed that for a little while when I first came into this place. But I did the numbers on the Fraser era from 1975 to 1983 and compared that with the Hawke-Keating era and found that the Fraser era put exactly double the amount of money into Australia's rail system that Hawke and Keating did. The rhetoric of this opposition is quite remarkable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The shadow minister is well noted for his exaggeration of what actually occurs, but one of the more remarkable statements I have heard in recent weeks was when Martin Ferguson visited the electorate. In an interview on the ABC he said, `There have been some job losses.' I remind him that there were actually 7,000 job losses when we had something like 2,000 jobs remaining in AN altogether. He subsequently went on to say that there had been `some job losses', not acknowledging in any way the 7,000 jobs lost. I find it absolutely amazing that they would come into this place and argue this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Staying with Martin Ferguson for just another few words, Martin Ferguson was the President of the ACTU who signed off the memorandum of understanding which set up the greenfield site to establish National Rail. The hostility from many in the work force at Port Augusta is still quite profound because they fully understand that AN was doomed once National Rail started.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Melbourne brought forward the reason why National Rail was established in the form it was in his speech on a similar matter on 7 September 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Rail was established separately because the states forced the Labor government to do it in order to have a proper interstate network.</PARA>
<PARA>The states forced the Labor government! True leadership! As we sadly have to keep reminding the House, once that decision was taken it was death by a thousand cuts for AN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the remaining time I have I want to talk about the future of rail. I think we have an opportunity to face up to our past and give it an honest assessment. For example, we can go back to the 1982 report of the House of Representatives transport committee which clearly stated then that there was a need for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8276"> reform and that it was expected by about the mid-eighties that AN would be in a position to break even.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the shadow minister to come into this place and say that we are acting on one year's bad figures is just unbelievable, but then he suggested that National Rail was performing well enough to justify its continued existence when, as the minister has indicated, it is expecting a revenue drop of between $45 million and $50 million. National Rail is already in trouble. We have intermodal revenue from all origins to Perth down $10.4 million for the quarter&mdash;that is 27 per cent&mdash;and the announcement by TNT. To further apply the pressure, will only exacerbate that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future of rail is bright. Rail is about a quarter of the $30 billion transport task in Australia. About $8 billion of transport task is a big business in itself. Port Augusta, Port Lincoln and Ceduna, those areas that do remain in rail&mdash;we will not talk about Peterborough; the opposition made sure that they did not have a future&mdash;have a strong future in rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comments of the local union secretary are most appropriate. He said, quite clearly, that AN had to change. There was absolutely no dodging that issue. He made the observation that he thought the management of AN had let them down. Where does the responsibility for the management of AN end up? It ends up with the minister. Minister Brereton went to the people in South Australia prior to the election and told them that all was well and that they would be protected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt about that. The tragedy for rail is that for too many years there has been too much politics and not enough clear thinking. It is once again up to this government to face up to the realities: to put rail on a firm footing and to offer the only structure that will give rail a reasonable future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I remind the House that there is $20 million for regional assistance in the package. That, if spent wisely and well, will give great opportunities for my electorate and, particular ly, for the people of Port Augusta, Port Lincoln and Ceduna. The $50 million environment package is very important, because it offers an opportunity to bring forward a lot of the work of rehabilitating the land and buildings that need attention so that they can be put to a more useful purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The redundancy packages have been honoured in Port Augusta. We have one of the big mines of the world at Olympic Dam, Roxby Downs. It can offer, with proper management, a great facility to combine with the efforts of rail in the region. Rail is very important from the grain lines to the iron ore lines to the Broken Hill lines&mdash;which rather artificially have been taken away from AN&mdash;right through to the Leigh Creek line and to the east-west traffic. So there is a great future for rail but with more imaginative and properly skilled managers we will see a much stronger effort in conjunction with the mining industry and the skilled work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One point on which I can agree with my opponents is that there have been very significant improvements by the work force in the rail industry. It is no fault of theirs that they find themselves in this position. It is due to the inability of the previous government to face up to the reality and, regrettably, the inability of the management of AN to show the leadership that is required for the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the following reports entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Development of facilities for 5 Aviation Regiment at RAAF Base Townsville</EMPHASIS>  and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Development of infrastructure of Townsville field training area, Townsville. </EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the reports be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The first report which I have tabled concerns proposed facilities at RAAF Base Townsville for 5 Aviation Regiment. The proposed works examined by the committee encompass two major elements. The first is the construction of an advanced wash facility and environmental shelters equipped with dehumidification equipment for Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters. This will reduce corrosion caused by operation and open storage of the helicopters in salt laden atmospheric conditions. The shelters will also reduce exposure of the helicopters to high temperatures and ultraviolet radiation and will alleviate occupational health and safety problems associated with personnel working on the helicopters in the tropical sun.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second is the relocation of 5 Aviation Regiment's transport and vehicle workshop facilities within the existing regimental precinct to enhance operational efficiency. Ancillary works involving the refurbishment of a helicopter arming area are also included. The estimated outturn cost of the proposed works is $21.332 million. The committee has recommended that the project proceed as planned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report concludes that Black Hawk helicopters operated by 5 Aviation Regiment at RAAF Base Townsville have experienced unexpectedly high rates of corrosion. This has been attributed to the use of high strength, lightweight alloys in helicopter structures and the operation and storage of aircraft in humid and salt laden atmospheric conditions. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation has affected internal electronic components and plastic fittings.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to questions from members, the Department of Defence advised the committee that development of the proposed work commenced 12 months before the tragic Black Hawk accident and that it is not linked in any way to the crash. RAAF Base Townsville remains the preferred location of 5 Aviation Regiment due to the proximity of 3 Brigade and impracticalities and considerable investment associated with alternative locations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">High corrosion rates have diminished the capacity to operate the helicopters through to life of type planned for 2015 as well as affecting aircraft serviceability and requiring expenditure on maintenance, with associated costs expected to exceed sustainable funding levels. The Department of Defence has implemented a corrosion control program for the helicopters to permit 5 Aviation Regiment's Black Hawk helicopters to operate effectively through to life of type.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To satisfy the requirements of the corrosion control program, there is a need to provide environmental protection shelters serviced by dehumidification equipment and an enclosed helicopter washing facility. Based on the number of Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters operated by 5 Aviation Regiment and current maintenance programs, there is a requirement for 19 Black Hawk and four Chinook shelters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Defence estimates that cost of environmental protection shelters would be recovered after two years, based on the $1.5 million cost of corrosion control undertaken in 1995 on four helicopters. With regard to the need for improved arrangements for vehicles and workshops, the committee has concluded that existing transport and some technical workshop facilities are located at inappropriately remote sites from 5 Aviation Regiment's precinct at RAAF Base Townsville. The facilities are inadequate and their locations present an ongoing cost to unit efficiency. There is also a need to relocate 5 Aviation Regiment's small arms repair section and to refurbish the gunship helicopter arming point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The report concludes that the proposed environmental protection shelters, the provision of dehumidification equipment and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8278"> helicopter wash facility can be justified as providing the necessary facilities for the successful and economic implementation of the corrosion control plan.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of works for the transport compound and workshop facilities can be justified on the basis of considerably improved working conditions, improved shelter and security for the extensive fleet of vehicles and resulting improved efficiency. The extent of the proposed ancillary work will improve the small arms repair section and ordnance loading aprons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of infrastructure on Townsville field training area, Townsville. By way of background, the proposal will enable the army and the RAAF to effectively utilise a large training area encompassing more than 230,000 hectares and to ease environmental pressures on the high range training area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Broadly, the proposal will provide: fences and warning signs; office accommodation for the range control organisation; communication facilities; access roads; basic infrastructure for a 350&hyphen;man camp; vehicle crossing points for creeks, roads and railways; and vehicle wash points. The estimated outturn cost of the proposed work was $18.694 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the committee's inquiry, members were able to fly over this extensive tract of land in two Black Hawk helicopters to inspect the extent of the training area and the sites for various components of the proposed work. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report concludes that a need exists to provide the necessary infrastructure to enable elements of the Australian Defence Force to undertake collective and joint training in live fire and manoeuvre, at brigade level, in the Townsville field training area. Of the development options examined, the preferred option will allow the range to be developed close to its maximum potential and provide training benefits within a realistic time frame and at realistic costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The extent of the proposed development can be justified on the grounds of public safety, effective management and maximum use of the range, in accordance with the user require ment and concepts for manoeuvre operations. The report supports the use of army engineers on elements of the project which would provide training benefits and not directly compete with the private sector. Design standards will conform with relevant codes, statutes and operational manuals and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed development was the subject of extensive environmental impact assessments demonstrating a commitment to responsible stewardship of the Townsville field training area by the Department of Defence. I commend the reports to the House.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the second of two bills containing veterans' affairs 1996&hyphen;97 budget measures. The first bill contained budget initiatives that will take effect earlier than the measures in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I introduced the first bill, I mentioned various budget and other initiatives that were important to the health and wellbeing of veterans and their families, but did not require legislation. I want to take the opportunity now to refer to another significant veterans' affairs budget initiative that will increase the general community appreciation of the sacrifices and the contribution made by the veterans of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to benefits and services provided directly to veterans and their families, the government recognises the importance of developing the community's knowledge and understanding of veterans' war experiences and the contribution of veterans to the development of the Australian identity over the past 100 years. In this year's budget, the government committed funding for a four&hyphen;year <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8279"> program of commemorative activities. This program will publicly and proudly honour the debt owed by all Australians to our veteran community through a range of programs of commemoration and education, and through the restoration of important memorials. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the content of this bill.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main thrust of this bill is the rationalisation of payments between my department and the Department of Social Security. This reflects the government's commitment to administrative reforms to streamline the delivery of government services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will allow age pensioners, who also receive a disability pension, to choose to be paid both pensions by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. For the veterans, and their eligible partners, it will mean that they need deal with only one department. I want to stress that this arrangement will not affect the eligibility for a service pension. There will be a continuing requirement for a veteran to have qualifying service to be paid a service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new arrangement will simplify payments to, and communication with, veterans who do not have qualifying service and who receive an age pension and a disability pension. The popular support for a concept like this was demonstrated last year when most war widows, who also received a social security pension, opted to receive all payments from the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another administrative reform flowing from this bill is the centralisation of payments to carers. From 1 July 1997, the Department of Social Security will have responsibility for all carer payments. Carers who have received Veterans' Affairs payments will be automatically transferred to the Department of Social Security's carer payment. A small number of carers, who could be disadvantaged or temporarily inconvenienced by the transfer, will continue to be paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other changes in this bill relate to the better targeting of income support benefits. The first of these address the relative economies single people can obtain from sharing the cost of rental accommodation. Two people in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> situation can now receive more rent assistance than a pensioner couple, even if their combined financial circumstances are the same. This bill will address that anomaly. Single people who share rented accommodation will be paid less rent assistance than they would receive if they did not share. There are some shared rent situations, such as for single people who have dependent children and for people in nursing homes, where the pensioner gains no advantage. The new arrangements will not apply in these situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also discontinues the `saved' eligibility for fringe benefits of a group of former service pensioners. These are people who would have lost eligibility for fringe benefits as a result of the introduction of deemed income in 1991. All service pensioners later became eligible for fringe benefits and many of those whose eligibility for fringe benefits had been `saved' a few years earlier could again qualify without the help of the `savings' provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who will be affected by the changes in this bill are those whose income has been in excess of the pension limits for the past four years. There is no justification to continue to allow these people to enjoy the broad range of fringe benefits provided by the Commonwealth and the community for the assistance of those in greater financial need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government remains committed to maintaining existing veterans' entitlements. Benefits and services need to be reviewed to maintain their quality, fairness and appropriateness. The government is also committed to improving efficiency in the delivery of these benefits and services. The outcome will be a system that is responsive to the changing needs of veterans and their families, and one that directs resources to the greatest needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion: this is a bill that reflects the government's intent to achieve greater efficiency in the delivery of services and fairness in the benefits it provides to veterans and their families. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting that we find it necessary in this parliament to debate a bill of this type. The fact is that the Flags Amendment Bill would never have been introduced if there had been absolute certainty amongst members of the parliament and the Australian public that there was no intention ever to change the Australian flag. It was only during the period of the last government that on a number of occasions, which began in 1984, it was necessary for members of the then opposition to constantly remind the parliament and the Australian people that we had a flag that was captive purely to an act of parliament and not to the constitution itself, a flag that was captive to the whims and the balance of numbers in this place and in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there were circumstances where uncertainty of the future of the Australian flag started to arise, and it was fostered, I would have to say, both by former Prime Minister Keating and by his predecessor, Bob Hawke. So there were hints, innuendos and some straight statements from time to time which aroused great concern amongst sections of the Australian community and amongst the majority of Australians that their flag, something they had grown up with, something they respected and honoured, was going to be changed at the whim of a parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, from 1984 there were moves in this parliament and in the Senate&mdash;as recently as 1994 by Senator Parer, who brought in a private member's bill in the Senate&mdash;to ensure that, firstly, the Australian people were conscious that the Australian flag could be changed by an act of parliament and, secondly, the sophistry of the Australian Labor Party was fully exposed. It seemed to us on this side of the House during that period when the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, went on foreign junkets or foreign travel that he wanted to raise and talk about nothing more significant than the Australian flag or the need for Australia to become a republic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was shameful, and nobody would understand that better than the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who is at the table, a man who knows the hearts and minds of Australia's veterans, those people who have given their lives and in many instances are suffering ill health from the conflict they participated in on our behalf. Those people know and understand the Australian flag, and that fact is appreciated by the minister and members on this side of the House, but it is not appreciated by the previous Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Prime Minister, on meeting President Suharto, launched into a tirade about the insignificance of the Australian flag, the irrelevancy of the Australian constitution, the need to change the flag and the need to establish a republic. President Suharto, in my opinion, would have been most impressed with a leader who thought so little of his own constitution, his flag and his country's symbols when the first thing that leader did when travelling overseas was to criticise and denigrate those very symbols!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I were endeavouring to convince the previous Prime Minister&mdash;or anybody else for that matter&mdash;that he should take a certain course of action, I would seek to persuade him that, first of all, the things I stood for were of value and that he would appreciate sharing them with me. I would tell him that his lifestyle or his opportunities would be enhanced by sharing the same values and goals that I had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the previous Prime Minister would not have a bar of that. No! The statement he is claimed to have made is presented in the book of the Prime Minister before him, Bob <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8281"> Hawke.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Keating had the opportunity in that time, and I think it showed such bad judgment on the part of the Australian Labor Party. Bob Hawke was a bit rough and a bit of a larrikin in his own way, but he was liked by Australians. They thought he was a knockabout Aussie and not a bad sort of fellow. He was not the sort of man who would come into this parliament and snooze. He would enliven the place. He would set it on end. I cannot imagine Bob Hawke, even today in his advancing years, going to sleep on any public occasion, because he with his wife would want to embellish and improve upon the environment where they were. But that is not the case with every member of the Labor Party. Members only have to look around them to know that Bob Hawke's standards are not the standards of the House today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just referring to the environment of the parliament and the members in it. I thank you for your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker. Bob Hawke was thought of as something of a larrikin. He was liked by the Australian people and he had the heart of an Aussie. Whilst he endorsed to some extent the broad issues of a republic and the change of the flag, he never pushed the issue hard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the following Prime Minister who made the difference in this place. Keating said that one of the great goals of the Australian Labor Party was to make these changes. I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think that was most regrettable. It hurt many important Australians&mdash;people important to the strength of the nation. They were not leaders perhaps, but they were people who had worked hard, people whose family had suffered loss or people who had been wounded or maimed during the great conflicts. These are the people who felt the battering and the denigration that was aimed at them through the words of the previous Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hence, the Flags Amendment Bill that we are debating today has become a necessity for the future of Australia. This issue has been raised three or four times from 1984 until last year, but with the change of government has come our commitment. When in opposition we said that we would, on coming to government, pass an act of parliament which would make it compulsory for the Australian government&mdash;unless they wished to be law&hyphen;breakers and become illegal in their method of operation&mdash;to go to the Australian people with a referendum to decide the future of our flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I include that qualification, because a future government wanting to change the flag would have to be a law-breaker. It would be possible for a future government to say, `We're going to ignore this act of parliament or we're going to amend it, so we don't have to go to a referendum and consult the people.' That is certainly true, but they will have to break a law or change a law to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see the Australian flag and what it stands for become part of the Australian constitution because, whilst the population of Australia changes and the attitudes of the people change, surely the values, the standards and the inheritance that we have make Australia different and unique, and those are the things we ought to be clinging to. Those are the values and standards that have made Australia the great nation that it is, and we must, if possible, stick to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to read briefly into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> part of a letter I received from a fine gentleman, a fellow called Reg Sampson. Reg Sampson was the auditor for the Reserve Bank. He knows Canberra well. He is a fine, distinguished career banker, a very high level public servant. He wrote to me recently about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8282"> the matters in this nation which he felt strongly about. I cannot find words that better describe the inheritance of the people of Reg's generation. They are the people who look forward to this parliament and the current generation carrying on some of the standards they set. Reg begins his letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One upsetting aspect of Keating's performance regarding our flag is that it is born out of hatred of anything British. Any change born out of hatred is bad and I surmise this is his motivation because the arguments he advances for change are so empty and specious he couldn't believe them himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another aspect of course is his predisposition that we cannot have complete sovereignty, independence and a sense of nationhood until we are a republic and have a new flag. While he and his government spout about sovereignty they surrender ours in numerous ways to the U.N. and other international organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>What more do we need to add, because that is a fact? He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When it comes to the question of unity, it was because of the sense of unity already there, that the Australian States federated. Had Keating read much of the diaries and letters of the men of the A.I.F. he would have learnt that they had an intense feeling of Australian nationalism and a pride in it. It is significant that their pride, which with most Australians today lies in the achievements of our sporting greats, was in themselves and their achievements fighting for their country as Australians. My father's own Great War diaries and letters are bound with expressions that the AIF hoped to bring credit to Australia as a nation. On Gallipoli he wrote, "Thank God Australia breeds such heroes".</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>There is an Australian battler, writing from Gallipoli `Thank God Australia breeds such heroes.' Reg Sampson goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the feeling of nationhood and unity and pride in their country by Australians was there much earlier than in the Great War. It led to Federation, without the need for unity being created by having to fight a war of independence as happened in America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In August 1900, before Australia was a Commonwealth, the Australian force at Elands River, during the Boer War, when surrounded by a greater force, and called upon by General De La Rey to surrender, sent the following reply&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If De La Rey wants our post, why does he not come and take it? We will be pleased to meet him and his men, and promise them a great <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reception at the end of a toasting fork, Australians never surrender! Australia forever!"</PARA>
<PARA>Those words were from the Boer War in 1900&mdash;something Keating never understood, something Keating never acknowledged and something Keating could not, in any way, endorse. Reg continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australians succeeded in holding their position. It should be remembered that they were not an AUSTRALIAN force; But forces under different titles from various States. They were State's military units.</PARA>
<PARA>And yet they thought as Australians. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reverting to Keating's statement, mentioned in my earlier letter, that Australians fought under the Union Flag in the Great War; I enclose two pieces of evidence of the use of the Australian Flag during that conflict.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the Union Jack, we have to appreciate that there are only about 14 or 15 absolutely free democratic nations on earth. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8283"> Australia is fortunate to be one of those. In the United Nations scale of ranking of freedoms, if you can devise such a process, Australia is the third freest nation on earth. There are a couple ahead of us, but we have a freedom that I believe is inherited by the parliamentary system that we have and the freedom of the courts from interference by the political process. So the right of a person to go before a court as an innocent individual is a very significant feature of Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many courts of the world, people are confronted by an adversarial court system where they go before the court  guilty and must prove themselves innocent. Our system is quite different to that, and it is a valuable freedom that we have. I believe that those two features of parliamentary democracy and the freedom of the courts stem from our British inheritance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the flag carries the symbol of the Southern Cross, claimed by republicans to be the symbol of republicanism. But I reject that concept. The miners at Eureka were typical Aussies. They told the government to get out of the way and get off their backs. The Australian people told the opposition some years ago that they did not want a GST. I think the fervent nature of Australians in their disregard for authority and government is an endearing character that we inherited and it is something that we should be proud of. No government in Australia will get too big for its boots while we have Australians with an attitude of dismissiveness towards authority and those people who want to preen or to promote authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my view that the inheritance of the Southern Cross is that of a typical Australian symbol, one that says that we are not overawed by authority. It is a matter where people look to an egalitarian society where there is equality of opportunity and where people seek the best by their own attributes and attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the third symbol of the Australian flag is the federal or Commonwealth star which symbolises the states and territories of this nation. The symbolism of one star representing the whole nation is in fact a symbol of unity and the need for this nation to work <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> together as a people if they wish to have achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in the symbolism of our flag, if you are thinking of symbolism for the future of this nation, we would have to say that we need and must cling to those inherited values of freedom, the parliamentary process and the significance of our court system, because they very much underpin our very society. The individuality of Australians is a very important characteristic, as is the capacity for us as a nation not to be overawed by government or those in authority but to be able to stand up for our own rights as individuals and as is the need for us as a nation to be able to work together if we want to achieve things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the symbolism of the flag has stood us in good stead in the past and it would be very difficult to replace it with another flag of similar significance. So it is with a great deal of pleasure that I support the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. I know that the bill will go through this parliament. I hope it will become an act of this parliament. I hope that future generations will value the contribution of members of this House as much as we can value the contributions of those who have gone before who have pointed out to us the way in which we need to revere and adhere to the principles and symbolisms that our flag stands for, because our flag does represent our nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K6">Mr BROUGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the gallery really should see the bow tie. What I like about the Australian flag is that it tells a story. It is not just a piece of coloured cloth. It is not three stripes. It tells a story about where we are, who we are and where we come from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the previous speaker, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), said, it shows the Southern Cross, which represents where we are in the world. It shows our unity as a nation with the federation star and the Union Jack. The Union Jack is not only about where we have come from and where our roots are&mdash;I am not too sure that others have alluded to it in this debate&mdash;but also the compilation of three other flags, they being the three Christian flags of St George, St Patrick and St Andrew.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also says something about what we are as a nation. When we fill out our census forms the overwhelming majority of Australians today still refer to themselves as Christians. It says where we are in the world geographically, the fact that we are unified, the fact that we are all together as one, and it says a little about where we have come from. The flag crosses all boundaries, whether you are black, white or brindle. It crosses your demographic and social boundaries. It is all&hyphen;encompassing. That is why I embrace the Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill today is not about whether I like the Australian flag or whether I want to see it changed, as some in this House obviously do. It is about whether or not one person or any one organisation should be able to change that flag without first relating that back to the people in the form of a plebiscite, a vote of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A symbol as important as our flag certainly deserves the consideration of the nation as a whole before it is changed. Many speakers before me have related how the flag was decided by competition and that it was only in the fifties that the flag actually passed into law, even though it has been used for the best <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> part of 100 years. It is also important for people to remember that we have only been a nation for less than 100 years. Whilst white Australians have been in this place for over 200 years, we have only been a nation&mdash;one Australian people&mdash;since the turn of the century. When we go into the next millennium, we must ask ourselves whether we are going to allow the will of just a few people or one or two organisations to determine the future of our pre&hyphen;eminent symbol of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn to a couple of the comments that have been made by those opposite in regard to our current flag. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) pointed out to us that when he is overseas and people run the New Zealand flag up the flagpole he is embarrassed because they have mistaken the New Zealand flag for the Australian flag. I would suggest to him that it is not something to be embarrassed about. Perhaps those that have run up the flag have shown their ignorance and they should be embarrassed. I certainly am not. Are we to change our name from Australia because Austria has been around for a lot longer than us and we have been mistaken before for Austria and people have used the wrong national anthem? It really does not follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have our national symbols. We have our national floral symbols and emblems and we have a national flag. It is not until it becomes the will of the overwhelming majority of Australians which can be reflected in the form of a vote that this parliament should ever elect to change it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One member opposite mentioned that the flag does not encompass the Aboriginals and that they now have their own flag and that perhaps the Union Jack should be removed out of the corner of our current flag and be replaced by the Aboriginal flag. But the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) rightly pointed out that the Aboriginals have never recognised a symbol such as a flag for the thousands of years they have occupied this country. The fact is that the Aboriginals have never been one nation. They have been an enormous different number of nations living on the one continent. They now all live <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8285"> under&mdash;and always have done&mdash;the Southern Cross. So why wouldn't they feel just as represented with this flag we currently have?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the elders of the Aboriginal community do not recognise the flag that is purported to be that of the Aboriginal people. Therefore, some person's opinion in this place that it would be a good idea to replace the Union Jack with the Aboriginal flag would be quite unrepresentative not only of the many migrants in this country but also of many of the Aboriginal people. I do not think it is for us to be judging what changes should be made. My views, as I pointed out earlier on and as I show by the fact that I wear the Australian flag today, are quite obvious. It does not mean that my views are any more representative or any better than those of any other person in this place or throughout this nation. Therefore, I feel that the only way we can ever determine a change to the Australian flag is to have the views of everybody considered. I will never be in a position of pushing my thoughts down their throats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions were also asked today as to why we are having the debate this week and why we are having the debate at all. One of these points was canvassed by the previous speaker, the Chief Government Whip, when he said, quite rightly, that under normal circumstances there should be no good reason why we would need to have this debate, other than that Australians were fearful that those who would undermine our symbols, and who took direct steps to do that, would remove Australia's No. 1 symbol from them without their having a say. Therefore in opposition we put forward the policy that we would encompass the views of Australians when and if ever the Australian people elect to change this symbol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I think that is a great step forward. But it shows the ignorance, the arrogance and the lack of ability to listen of those opposite in the previous parliament. I might add that I am not referring to all of those present today or all of those in this parliament, the 38th Parliament, but certainly to a good number of those. That is probably one of the reasons why&mdash;because they misrepresented the Aus tralian population so badly&mdash;so few of them remain here now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to having the debate this week, it was put earlier today that this debate was no more than a filler. What an interesting day of filling we have had! The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made a speech to the parliament on the achievements of the Howard government. Of course, there have been many achievements in the short period that we have been in government. A day on which the Prime Minister elects to speak to the Australian people and to the parliament about the first nine months of the Howard government is certainly a day on which I am more than happy to stand in this place and talk about the Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a very important day for many Australians because it is the day on which, yet again, we have seen a further cut in interest rates, which will be welcomed by Australian families, as they also welcome the news that their flag will have security because of this legislation. So there are many good reasons why this day&mdash;and this week&mdash;is a very good and appropriate time to debate this question so that we, the people's house of the Australian parliament, ensure that the question of whether the Australian flag is changed remains a decision for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A point made by some of those opposite is that this legislation can be changed. They are 100 per cent correct. Any legislation can be changed; we know that. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if under the previous regime this legislation had been in place and they had intended to push ahead with their thoughts of changing the Australian flag, the first step they would have had to take would have been to have a vote or, at the very least, change the legislation in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that would be somewhat telegraphing your punches, and the people who have now formed the Australian Flag Association around this nation, who feel very strongly about maintaining this as our national flag for many years to come, would have been mobilised very quickly to ensure that the wider community was aware of what was afoot. That is what this legislation is about. It is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8286"> about involving all Australians in determining their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next year, we will no doubt see a debate on whether we will become a republic. Once again, rather than dominating the debate, we will see the Prime Minister and the government taking a leading hand in the debate but not directing it, not enforcing their will upon others. That is very much why this legislation has been framed in its current form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also suggested that this piece of legislation and the whole flag debate really did not need to be debated at all, that it was not really important, that the economy was important. You are right: the economy is very important. We are seeing massive changes and improvements to the economy as this government grows in stature, as we see interest rates, as I said earlier, coming down, as we see tax cuts being delivered to the average family household on 1 January, and as we see the industrial relations reforms coming into place. But the symbols are still important and people like to have that security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many members who have spoken before me are active in their own communities, particularly with the veterans. I am as well, as a member of the Bribie Island RSL Club, as a former member of the defence forces and the Vietnam Veterans Association. These people are just a small part of the community who feel very dearly about our current flag. They would see themselves as being absolutely betrayed if this flag were changed, after the sacrifices they have made. If that becomes the will of the people, I am sure they will be willing to accept that. But they will not be willing to accept the views of a very small minority who want to force their opinions upon the wider community; and nor should they.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I reiterate that this bill is not just about my preference, the preference of the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) or any other member of this parliament. It is about the preference of the wider community. These questions, which are about who we are as a people and the symbols that we put forward, should rightly be debated throughout the Australian community, and people should <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have an input. But they should always be secure in the knowledge that there is legislation in place by a responsible government, that their rights to their opinions and to the changing of their national symbols will be safeguarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, the post office on Bribie Island in my electorate pulled down the Australian flag. I received numerous calls. There were letters to the editor and articles in the local paper. It created an interest in the community because they looked to that symbol as they went about their daily business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a positive note, more Australians in that area have now chosen to fly the Australian flag in their own backyards. I believe in this form of patriotism. I believe in showing that you are proud of your country and your nation's symbols. I believe that this Australian flag, as it currently stands, will fly over this parliament and this nation for many years to come.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will only be once the Australian public has spoken in overwhelming numbers that we will change our symbols or our form of government. This legislation will ensure that those safeguards are in place. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with great interest this afternoon to the comments of a dozen or so honourable members who have spoken before me in this debate on the Flags Amendment Bill. Obviously, when one takes into consideration the brevity of the bill it is very interesting to hear the different concepts and philosophies that people have about our national emblem. I support the Flags Amendments Bill which will ensure the protection of our national flag. The purpose of this bill is to amend the 1953 act to ensure that the only way the flag can be replaced is if a majority of electors in each state and territory agree to the change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the history of our national flag, we find that we had our first flag in 1788&mdash;and we have heard many speakers refer to this this afternoon. In 1876, the flag of New South Wales became a very important emblem for the Australian continent. In 1901, the Commonwealth decided to hold a design competition for two flags&mdash;one for official <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8287"> and naval purposes and the other for merchant ships. My understanding from reading some of the history of that competition is that the prize was put up by a tobacco company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1902, Edward VII approved the design which comprised the blue ensign, the Union Jack, the federation star and the Southern Cross on a blue background. For 50 years, both flags were used on land and sea. It was not until the passing of the Flags Act 1953 that the Commonwealth blue ensign became the official national flag. Today, the Australian flags of the original states of the Federation have the Union Jack as part of their designs, but the new flags adopted by the territories do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will talk about the Northern Territory flag for a moment. It has the stars of the Southern Cross as part of its design. The colours on the flag are white, black and ochre. The white and black represent the people of the Northern Territory and the ochre represents the colour of the earth in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1902, the national flag had on it a sixpointed star&mdash;the federation star. In 1908, the star was changed to have seven points&mdash;six points for the states and the seventh point representing the territories. In my eyes, the template of the national flag is one of multicultural design. Some members were quite surprised when I brought it to their attention that the stars of the Southern Cross were named after letters in the Greek alphabet. Did you did know that?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SULLIVAN" NAMEID="3E4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Mrs Sullivan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I did not know that.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5M6">Mr DONDAS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The five stars are: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon. The Southern Cross, which has been a symbol of our region, was obviously named many centuries ago by Greek astronomers. I tried to develop a further line on that, but, unfortunately, I ran out of time. The template of the Australian flag and the red ensign are quite clearly referred to in a book I have with me, so that cannot be disputed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This afternoon, I heard members talk about the flag of St Andrew, the flag of St George and the flag of St Patrick. I was told by a colleague when I was in the United Kingdom some years ago that St Andrew, who is the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> patron saint of Scotland, was a Greek. That astounds quite a number of my Scottish friends. Apparently it is true. St Andrew's bones were found floating around the North Sea about seven centuries ago. It is certainly very interesting when you delve into the history of the flag. Flags certainly have a lot of history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A flag expresses one's pride. Members who have spoken in this debate this afternoon, and the Australian community, have expressed a great deal of pride in our national flag. The time when we have a great deal of pride is when the Olympic Games or the Commonwealth Games are on and an Australian wins an event and the Australian flag goes up and the Australian anthem is played. Australians, as well as the successful competitor, feel a great deal of pride at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been other flags that have been adopted over the last few years. The Eureka flag was a very important symbol of our colonial history. Other flags have been used from time to time. I am sorry that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) is not here. I would like to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a passage from a very interesting story in a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Flag in Wartime</EMPHASIS>, because other members have spoken this afternoon about the wars that Australian men and women have fought in and the various flags that they fought under. The passage from the book says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An Australia blue ensign was raised in Singapore when the Japanese surrender was announced in 1945. This flag had been made secretly by Australian prisoners of war, who stitched a small Union Jack that had escaped the notice of the Japanese guards onto a piece of blue material obtained from Japanese stores. White handkerchiefs from Red Cross parcels made up the stars. The flag was raised over the `X3' working camp at Bukit Panjang and later over the Australian Imperial Forces' headquarters at Changi. This flag is among the many historic flags that are preserved at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the flag that was made by those prisoners of war in Singapore at the time is on display in a glass case at the War Memorial. Just think of what the Japanese custodians may have done to those prisoners.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8288">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the world, in conflict and in joy, the Australian national flag is very well respected and, as I said, a lot of people have a lot of pride in it. I for one do support the amending bill moved by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) to ensure that, if the flag is ever going to be changed for any reason, the matter comes back to the parliament. If the parliament cannot decide that the changes are necessary, then I would accept the recommendation that has been made by other members of this House that maybe a referendum should be held on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very deep&hyphen;rooted part of Australia's history. We are a country that is just over 200 years old. Other countries throughout the Commonwealth are 400 and 500 years old and steeped in history. If we are going to leave a legacy to our children, then I believe that we must make a firm stand now. That is what I believe the coalition is doing. In the past few years, there has been discussion and debate on the probability of our national flag being changed or even being got rid of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, I am of ethnic, of Greek, origin. The Union Jack really does not have a great deal of symbolic realism to me. But being born in Australia and being an Australian, having the Union Jack on the flag certainly does symbolise the true heritage of this country. It is for that reason that I would fight tooth and nail to make sure that, if the flag was ever going to be changed, it would be changed only by the will of the Australian community. With those words, I have no hesitation in supporting the amending bill moved by the minister.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe I am in a unique position in this debate on the Flags Amendment Bill in the House today in that I am the only member of the House who has actually spoken on the issue in both chambers. In 1984, the opposition introduced the Flags Amendment Bill into the Senate and the second reading was moved in September. The debate on it took place in October. Unfortunately, I did not get to vote on it there. The debate was adjourned and was not resumed until February 1985 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when the debate was concluded and the bill passed on the voices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have often said to people that the first lesson of politics is patience. I think that possibly the Flags Amendment Bill is a very good example of that. The bill did pass the Senate in February 1985, as I have said, and was subsequently introduced into this House in 1985 by the gentleman who is now the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Mrs SULLIVAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you&mdash;and have the opportunity to debate and vote on it again. National symbols are a subject in which I have taken a very longstanding interest&mdash;national symbols including the flag but not exclusively about the flag&mdash;and I find that, whilst the flag is something that many people in the community hold passionate views on, many of them are really very badly informed about it. It was no coincidence that the basic flag design that we have today was submitted by four individuals in response to the competition that was run to choose a national flag back at the end of the 19th century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of record that four people submitted the same design and shared the prize and that a few years later that design was slightly modified by the addition of the seven&hyphen;pointed federation star underneath the Union Jack. I say it is no coincidence that four people submitted an identical design because that design had been in wide usage well before the competition was run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first example of that design that I have been able to identify goes back to an organisation called the Australasian Anti&hyphen;Transportation League which in the 1850s adopted that design as its symbol, the differences, of course, being that the federation star was not on it and the stars of the Southern Cross were in gold. But in all other respects the design was the same as the one that won the competition for the new Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is particularly appropriate that our present flag originated from that organisation because it was the anti&hyphen;transportation movement which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8289"> was the beginnings of an organised voice amongst people then living in what were British colonies&mdash;some of them semi self&hyphen;governing, others not&mdash;towards a new democratic free nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The anti&hyphen;transportation movement had as its objective stopping the transportation of convicts from England to Australia because those who were behind the movement recognised that Australia could never be free and self&hyphen; governing, could never be anything other than a colony, for as long as it was a repository for English convicts. So in the 1850s the Australasian Anti&hyphen;Transportation League adopted that basic design of the Union Jack and the Southern Cross. It is worth putting on record that our present flag has that very longstanding link with the very beginnings of the democratic self&hyphen; government process in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A flag is the most important national symbol that a country has. It is the symbol that a country chooses to represent itself to the rest of the world. Therefore, it is something that should not be lightly adopted or rejected. It should not be lightly changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no difficulty at all with the present design of the flag&mdash;in fact I like it&mdash;as a symbol of modern Australia. One of the great beauties of the flag and its symbolism is that it is a growing symbolism; it is one that extends itself over the decades. It probably had a very significant meaning back in 1850, had a slightly different meaning in 1901 and it again has a new meaning in Australia at the end of the 20th century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Often, like other members, I have presented flags at schools and, in so doing, attempted to explain to quite young people the significance of the symbolism. On the subject of the Southern Cross, I say to them that it was like a signpost in the early days when the early explorers realised that there was a continent in the southern hemisphere. In the early days of discovery of the Australian continent and in its early days of settlement, those who came here used sailing ships and had none of our modern navigational aids. It was by the Southern Cross that they found their way to Australia. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Southern Cross was a constellation visible only in the southern hemisphere. Over time, sailors and navigators of those sailing ships realised that once they could sight the Southern Cross in the heavens, then they could find a bearing for Australia. So the Southern Cross became a signpost to this new country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great things about our very special nation is that we are still a young nation and we remain young by the continued evolution of a new society. In recent times there has been a lot of debate&mdash;which I do not intend to re&hyphen;visit here today&mdash;on the subject of immigration to Australia. Since the end of the Second World War, with the great waves of immigrants and refugees who came to Australia in the late 1940s, the 1950s and the 1960s, Australia changed and became yet another new nation, different in many respects from the one that existed up until the end of the 1930s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the late 1970s, we have again taken a new direction socially and culturally as a result of immigration. But the core values of this country have remained the same. Those core values find their origin in those who initially settled this country and then worked to make it a self&hyphen;governing democracy. So all the symbols on the flag are to me today as relevant as they would have been to the new Australians of the new nation of Australia in 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some reference in this debate to the Flags Act 1953. Some time ago I first had cause to consult the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the day and to read the debate on the original bill. It makes very interesting reading because everybody was in enthusiastic agreement with the bill&mdash;everybody supported the design of the flag and its origins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons I searched that debate was because of some little controversy that existed in the community&mdash;and still does, to some extent&mdash;regarding the blue ensign and the red ensign. When I was at school, the Flags Act was proclaimed. The first I knew that anything had happened in relation to the flag was a change in our daily parade&mdash;as we used to have in schools in those days. We used to all line up on a bitumen school <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8290"> ground, the school fife band would play <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">God Save the King</EMPHASIS> and the flag would go up the flagpole.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It shows how old I am, doesn't it? The flag was this red ensign. But then one fine day the flag that went up the flagpole was a blue one. Nobody ever explained to us why the flag had changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you are a child, ritual is very important. This ritual of the flag raising every day was very much part of my daily life, so I was quite startled. I remember very clearly that first occasion when a different flag went up the flagpole. One of the reasons it became anchored in my memory was that, when we used to take what were euphemistically referred to as art classes at school&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Mrs SULLIVAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Art was never my best subject. From time to time it was relevant to include&mdash;in whatever topic our teacher had given us to invent a drawing of&mdash;a depiction of the Australian flag. I remember that I was never really sure from the first day the blue ensign went up the pole just what my flag was. So what I used to do was have two bob each way. If I had to do a drawing of something that included the flag, I would look back through my art book to see what colour I had done it the previous time. If it was blue that time, then this time I would do it red, then the next time I would do it blue and so on. I think I was probably hoping that my art teacher would tell me what was right and what was wrong. But I never was corrected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sadness of it is that our teachers did not know why the colour of the flag changed either. It changed, if you look at those debates on the Flag Bill 1953, because there was confusion as to whether the national flag was a blue ensign or a red ensign. In fact, both were our flags prior to the Flags Act being passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things the Flags Act did was to make the red ensign henceforth exclusively the flag of the merchant navy and the blue ensign exclusively the national flag. Both coloured flags were in common usage. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reason we had a red ensign at school was that it was commonly used at schools. The reason a blue ensign went up one fine day was that the then government distributed to all schools in Australia blue ensigns to replace the red ensign, which then became exclusively the flag of the merchant navy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There has been some controversy on that subject with an organisation called the Australian National Flag Association. On one occasion in Queensland I got into a fairly unseemly argument with one Dr Rupert Goodman on that subject. I knew I was right and he was wrong. His view was that a lot of flags were stolen. The reason that some people were flying red flags was they had actually stolen them from the merchant navy. I found it fairly implausible that all the schools in Queensland, my home state, were flying stolen flags. I mention as an aside that I had attended quite a number of schools throughout Queensland because my father happened to be in a job which led him to frequent transfer. I attended a lot of schools throughout Queensland. They all flew the red flag prior to this event of the blue flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only walking through the corridors of Parliament House one day that I got my proof about the common usage of the red ensign. I do not know where this painting is now, but it used to be at the basement level of the old Parliament House. It was a painting of a very famous picture of the opening of the first Commonwealth Parliament House&mdash;what we now refer to as the old Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also a photograph of the Duke of York arriving to perform the opening. The photograph is in black and white. If you examine it, you will see that a great number of flags were hanging from the building and they were alternately the Australian flag and the Union Jack. There were equal numbers of the Union Jack flying. There was a contemporary painting done at the time. All depictions of the Australian flag in that painting are of the red ensign. I take it that the artist saw what he was painting and then copied the photograph.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I mention that for a very particular reason because I want to put on the record something that has bothered me ever since 1987. In 1987 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8291"> there was a display in the foyer of the old Parliament House for the 60th anniversary of the opening of the Parliament House. That display included a new painting of that photograph. Every Australian flag in that new painting was a blue ensign. That is quite wrong. I think that painting was especially commissioned by the National Library. It is now its property. But I want the world to know it is wrong. The original painting in the old Parliament House is the one that is historically correct. That is a fairly major digression in time from what we are debating now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. It just goes to show there are endless things you can say about the flag.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to the beginning of my speech and to that original debate that was held in the Senate on which eventually there was a vote taken in early 1985. By that time I was no longer a senator, I was a member of the House of Representatives. I spoke in the debate on the Flags Bill in the Senate in October 1984 when I was still a senator for Queensland. I regret that I did not get to vote on the bill there. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on such a bill again in this place. I am very pleased that we will vote on it here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put on the record there was only one government senator who spoke in the Senate debate, and that was Senator Grimes who was then the deputy leader of the government. He was dismissive of the entire debate and said that it was all a waste of time. Nevertheless, there was a concern in those days about some actions that were being taken in relation to national symbols. Part of the concern was the Labor Party's own fault because, whenever you asked whether it was the government's intention to change the flag, you could never get a straight answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout all the debate, queries and questions raised in recent years, including in this chamber, about the possibility of Australia becoming a republic, the one subject on which its greatest advocate, the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, would never utter a syllable was the flag. He left a very large question mark over the whole thing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my own experience of an organisation called Ausflag, I am aware that probably the longest standing campaigner, or rather the most influential campaigner, in Australia for a change of flag is one Rupert Murdoch. A flag competition was run by Ausflag a few years ago in which a prize was offered and a certain design was chosen. It was all entirely backed by Rupert Murdoch. Rupert Murdoch is also our most noteworthy campaigner for a republic in this country. It should be a matter of record that this former Australian, now an American, always has been one of the driving forces in moves for changing the flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I conclude with my original point: if there is to be any change in flag design it has to come from the people, just as the original design evolved through several decades of Australian history from the 1850s through to 1901; and it was a popular choice because it had come about through usage. It was truly a flag of the people by the time it was declared to be the Australian flag. It was the flag that Australians of the very new nation of Australia wished to have as the symbol of their nation to the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should the flag ever be changed&mdash;I personally very strongly doubt that there will ever be national sentiment to that extent&mdash;then it must be a flag of the people. It cannot be a flag that is foisted on us by others, no matter how superior they may think their wisdom is, because the flag is so basic to the community. Therefore, I very enthusiastically yet again support the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. It will give the people the right to vote in a referendum on any proposed change to Australia's national flag.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Wannon)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(6.24 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to join in the debate and support the Flags Amendment Bill. I believe it is a bill that is long overdue. It has many things going for it but the most important one is, as the previous speaker, the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) has said, that it enshrines the right of the Australian people to choose their own flag and, also, for them to have a say on any decision on the flag. What it really does is to facilitate the parliament being able to put to the people a form for either keeping or wanting to change the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8292"> flag&mdash;which I too believe, like the previous speaker, is very unlikely, certainly in the next few decades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Another reason that I am very keen to support this bill is that I have been a very staunch supporter of the Australian flag not only since I have been a member of parliament but long before that. I have always had great delight in presenting Australian flags, within my electorate, to organisations that qualify for the Australian flag and also to students who are going overseas on exchange programs. I think the Australian flag is a marvellous symbol for people to take overseas and to present to their hosts as a reminder of their visit and, at the same time, it is a reminder of the fact that they are ambassadors for Australia. What better way to remind people of that than to present an Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I can confidently say that I have presented over a thousand flags within the electorate of Wannon since I have been the member. Furthermore, I have presented many petitions to this parliament, and the number of signatures on those petitions would exceed 10,000. I have had a close association with the flag both within my electorate&mdash;and I have been very proud to do so&mdash;and also within the parliament itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On three separate occasions I have presented a private member's bill on exactly the same matter as this bill: back in 1990, in 1991 and again in 1992. On those three occasions I put a challenge to the previous Labor government to accept a vote on that private member's bill, yet they never would. I think it is to their eternal shame that they were not sufficiently proud of the Australian flag to be able to enshrine this bill in legislation in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We are now very fortunate that we have a government that is prepared to stand up so firmly for the Australian flag and to put this bill to the parliament. It is very important to remind ourselves that it is not just a question of politicians and members of parliament when it comes to choosing the Australian flag. That decision rightly belongs with the people of Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One of the interesting things when I presented that private member's bill on those three separate occasions is that I was sure there were many members of the then government, the Labor Party, who privately agreed with what was being proposed but, unfortunately, because of their then leaders, they were always being forced to toe the line. I particularly refer to the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, who seemed to have a pathological hatred for the Australian flag; in fact, for everything that was symbolic of the achievements of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who could forget his performance when he went to Indonesia in 1992 and the way he disparaged our flag when he was overseas? As a former foreign minister and Governor-General, Mr Hayden, once said, `The one thing you don't do when you go overseas is bag your own country.' Unfortunately, his former colleague obviously did not extend that as far as the Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One was often cynical enough to think that the former Prime Minister used questioning the Australian flag as a diversionary tactic when Australia got into so much trouble with the recession that we `had to have'. He obviously thought that by distracting the attention of people with an argument about the Australian flag he would somehow take the spotlight off his own shortcomings and the shortcomings of his time as Treasurer and, more recently, as Prime Minister. Clearly, it got out of control and I believe that rightly the Australian people have continued to reject the comments and thoughts of the former Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now I think there will be widespread support right throughout the community for this bill. Unlike when Labor was in government, the parliament is going to be able to have a vote on this bill and I would be very confident of the outcome. I do find it rather curious, though, that until as recently as 1988 the Labor Party had it on its platform that it would abolish the current flag, then suddenly&mdash;I guess because electoral pressures started to get a bit stronger&mdash;it slipped off the platform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet for a long time it was also a part of the symbol of the Australian Labor Party so it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8293"> seemed they often wanted to have two bob each way by, on the one hand, bagging the Australian flag but, on the other hand, trying to confuse the Australian public by using the Australian flag as part of their logo. It is also interesting to note the comments of the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) who in 1981 in the Senate had a little number to say about the Australian flag. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we can do rather better than the present undistinguished and undistinctive bit of cloth which we have inherited from our colonial past and which manifestly does not set anybody's pulse racing in the community at large except, perhaps, the occasional Returned Services League blimp or a proportion of the tory back bench opposite.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition when he was in the Senate back in 1981. What it shows is just how out of touch he was even then with the sentiments of the Australian people. No wonder he is in opposition, as he was then. This really is an insult to the Australian people but it also shows the shame of this man and his party on their lack of understanding of the history of Australia. It is also an enormous insult to those who served their nation overseas under the Australian flag; who were proud to serve their nation under the Australian flag; and who saw that as the symbol of why they were prepared to go and serve Australia overseas, often in great hardship&mdash;and sometimes they paid the supreme price for doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it does show that the Labor Party of today is very different from the Labor Party of the past. If we go back to 1953 when the Flags Act was introduced by then Prime Minister Menzies, the leader of the Labor Party, Arthur Calwell, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . every nation needs a symbol of its unity . . . It is true that a flag is merely a piece of bunting, but it is also true that it is something round which the whole nation can be rallied . . . Now that we have a national flag, let us give it pre&hyphen;eminence on all occasions.</PARA>
<PARA>That shows just how different the Australian Labor Party was in those days; how in touch it was then and how out of touch it has become in more recent times. At the time the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian flag was first created, just after we became a Commonwealth, it was inaugurated under a very simple but very telling slogan: one people; one destiny; one flag. I think that is as true today as it was back at the time of Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to go back through a little bit of history of flags in Australia. I know there has been some discussion already but I would like to add a little bit more to it. We have to go right back to 1642 when Abel Tasman discovered Van Diemen's Land to find when the first flag was brought to Australia. Of course, it was a Dutch flag and it was taken onto Australian soil through the surf by someone swimming. Then on 29 April 1770, some 130 years later, Captain Cook raised the Union Jack at Botany Bay and on 22 August in that same year he again raised the flag at Cape York and claimed the east coast in the name of King George III. But as Britain did not take formal possession of Australia until 1788 the French had time to make some territorial claims and did this by raising a French flag at Shark Bay in Western Australia in 1773. I think that shows just how symbolic flags were seen to be then and, I believe, are still seen to be today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first flag that was designed and made in Australia was created from a silk wedding dress and it was flown by the bride's husband at Richmond in New South Wales back in 1806. It was inspired by the news of Nelson's victory in 1805. As has already been said, the current flag evolved from a competition held by the first Australian government jointly with a magazine called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of Reviews</EMPHASIS> back in 1901. The prize money, a total of &pound;200, came partly from the government, which offered &pound;75; partly from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of Reviews</EMPHASIS>, which also offered &pound;75; and&mdash;because they were a bit short&mdash;&pound;50 from the Havelock Tobacco Company. Times have changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been mentioned there were more than 32,000 designs submitted, not only from Australia but also from New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada, Malta, India, China, the United States and the Shetland Islands. The winners were chosen&mdash;five different people with five different designs&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8294">and they shared that prize money. In 1909 there was a slight change when the federation star was increased from six points to seven points to include the territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to look at a little bit of the flag, just to see how significant each part of the flag is. If we look in the canton, or the first quarter, we see the Union Jack. Some might say, `What is the role of the Union Jack there today?' It is worth reminding the House why it is there and what the Union Jack stands for because it stands for independence and it also stands as a symbol of unity because the Union Jack is made up of three parts: the cross of St George, for the English heritage; the cross of St Andrew, for the Scottish heritage; and the Psalter of St Patrick, for the Irish heritage which goes into the Union Jack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It goes much further than that because the Union Jack tells us not only a lot about our history but also a lot about much of our origins: our Westminster system of democracy and of democracy itself; our independent judiciary; much of our culture and many of our traditions; and, probably most significantly, our language, the English language. So the Union Jack has a very significant role on the flag even today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the federation star, which symbolises the coming together of the six colonies to become the six states, with the seventh point added to represent the territories. Then there is the Southern Cross, which we are very proud to have there. We see that very much as showing our geographical position in the world, being the land of the Southern Cross.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to debunk some of the arguments we hear when people talk about changing the Australian flag. Our flag is not only a great symbol of national unity, it is also an icon that reminds us of the great strengths of the democracy we have inherited, a symbol of so much of our heritage, and it represents the democratic processes of our founding fathers, as described earlier. We talk about our role in the Asian region today, but we are still the land of the Southern Cross; it still symbolises where we are in this region, not just in the whole world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about history and where we fit in it is worth being reminded of the words of a couple of very wise people who have commented in the past on the importance of recognising one's history. The Roman statesman Cicero said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not to know what happened before you were born is always to be a child.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that reflects the importance of the Australian flag and the fact that it reminds us of events that took place before we born. A more recent great man, Edmund Burke, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People will not look forward to posterity who never looked back to their ancestors.</PARA>
<PARA>Like most members in this House, and like most Australians, I am very proud of our history. No country has a history devoid of tragedy but few countries have a history as proud as ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud of the traditions we have inherited from the United Kingdom&mdash;constitutional government, English common law, trial by jury and the Christian concepts of behaviour, of right and wrong. To disown the flag is to deny that heritage. I think it behoves all of us to lead the nation on this issue, particularly since we must look at bringing up the next generation to understand what is so important in our heritage and history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with great pride that I stand here today, having sponsored similar bills back in 1990, 1991 and 1992. As someone who very much represents the views of his electorate and the views of the wider Australian community, I support this bill. It is very timely and very important because it will allow the parliament to enshrine the right of all Australians to have a say in any change that might occur to the flag of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flag is a very important and integral part of this nation and to deny the people a say in keeping it would be very remiss of the parliament. Passing this bill would ensure that the people of Australia will continue to have a say in this very important symbol of our nation, the Australian flag.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I too am delighted to speak in support of this quite historic piece of legislation, the Flags Amendment Bill 1996, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8295"> to put in place measures to protect the design of the Australian flag. The flag evokes deep feelings of loyalty and commitment among Australians. We fly our flag with pride because it is the symbol of our country and we are proud of our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Australians, we live in a wonderful country with bountiful opportunities. Much of our past, our present, and our aspirations for the future, are incorporated in the symbolism of the design of our flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flag is the symbol of our country, but of itself it contains a great deal of symbolism. When you hear critics of the flag you would think that it was entirely dominated by the Union Jack. In fact, the Southern Cross is perhaps the most significant symbol on our flag, taking up over half of its area. Australia is called the `Land under the Southern Cross', so it is a most fitting symbol for us to have on our national banner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Federation Star tells the world a great deal about Australia. We are a federation of states rather than one country divided into provinces, as is the case in so many other national federations. We have stars on our flag&mdash;stars being the symbol of high goals and high ambitions. We aim high and have high objectives for our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have on our flag the Union Jack, which, as the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) commented, is itself a combination of symbols which reflect something of the past of our country&mdash;the fact that we are a part of the British Commonwealth of Nations and the contribution that Britain made to our early settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in these days, when we talk about Australia being a multicultural country, the Union Jack also fills another role. It demonstrates that Australia is a country also made up of people who have come here from other parts of the world. It has often been said that the history of Australia is a chronicle of 200 years of immigration. We have on our flag the flag of another country to demonstrate the contribution that people from other parts of the world have made in building the great Australia that we know and love today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So those symbols have been put together on a single pennant&mdash;our national flag. We fly that flag with pride because of the way in which it symbolises the achievements and the aspirations of our country. Our flag has been taken with our soldiers into battle, our statesmen into negotiation, our sportsmen into victory. It has been there on occasions of great national pride. It has been there on occasions of great celebrations. It has also been there when our nation has been in sorrow. Is it any wonder, therefore, that Australians have become attached to their flag? Is it any wonder, therefore, that it evokes such deep feelings of loyalty and commitment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should come as a surprise then to observers around the world that it should even be necessary for this parliament to be considering legislation to ensure that the flag's design is not just changed on the whim of a Prime Minister or on the whim of a parliament. One would have thought that after flying proudly in this country for almost a century it would be utterly entrenched, but this legislation has become necessary because it was only this time last year that we had a Prime Minister who had no commitment to the flag, who openly advocated that it should be changed and who travelled around the world talking about the inappropriateness of our flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was unable to persuade Australians that their flag needed to be changed, but he never ceased, it seems, when overseas to be critical of the flag. His attempts to rewrite history, to somehow or other make the flag irrelevant, were quite pathetic. His efforts to demean the contribution of the early pioneers, to reinvent history to support his own theories, were part of a very tragic era for our country. I support the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who has refused to accept the black armband version of our history. He is not ashamed of our past and neither am I.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that not everything that has happened since Australia was settled by Europeans has been perfect. Our treatment of our Aboriginal people, for instance, has often been criticised, but I think even there some of the criticism is unfairly placed. It is true that, with the benefit of hindsight, we know some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8296"> things that were done at that time could have been done better, but I have no doubt that there were many Australians who were diligently attempting to assist the Aboriginal people. Even when it was taking children away from their families, it was done with the best of intent with the view that it was the best way to make a better life for the Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have no reason to be ashamed of the diligence and the efforts of past Australians, even when on occasions they may have failed. To achieve great success, sometimes we have to dare to be different and sometimes that daring can come unstuck. But that is all a part of our proud past, the proud traditions of our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ours is, indeed, a young nation capable of standing on its own feet, so we need to have a flag that we can revere. A very significant element of a country's uniting beneath its flag is its permanence. The fact is that we have had the one flag since Federation and it continues to fly proudly above our buildings and on occasions of national significance. That creates a unity between the past and the present. The fact that what we plan today and know will come to fruition also under this same flag binds us with the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is very significant support for the Australian flag. A recent public opinion poll by AGB McNair demonstrates that 66 per cent of the Australian people support the design of the existing flag and only 27 per cent oppose it. It is interesting to note that survey was taken in spite of the campaign organised by the former Prime Minister to cast reflections on the suitability of the design. Despite the efforts by the former Prime Minister and others to design alternative flags, none have won any degree of support whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was especially appropriate that on Anzac Day this year the Prime Minister committed the new federal government to take action, as promised in its election platform, to protect our great national symbol&mdash;the Australian flag. He said on 25 April:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation will be introduced early in the life of the new parliament to ensure that the Australian flag cannot be changed without the approval of all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Australian people voting at a referendum or a plebiscite. This will mean that no politician, no political party and no special interest group will be able to tamper with the design of our flag.</PARA>
<PARA>Tonight, we are proudly seeing the fulfilment of the Prime Minister's promise and this legislation is being debated before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were ever to seek to change our flag, there would be an even greater rejection of whatever design might be chosen than of the design of our current flag. I have seen almost on a monthly basis somebody come forward with a new design, and it is always decried by those who see it. Even in this parliament earlier today we saw another design, which looked like it belonged more to a used car sale than on top of our national parliamentary building, being paraded as another possible alternative. There have been some pretty, graphic designs. There has been some skilful use of various symbols to develop banners which might appeal to some, but it is impossible to believe that any of those designs could ever capture the support of the Australian people and win a referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the features of this legislation that I think is very important, and that I am delighted to see included, is the requirement that, if there were to be a referendum for a new flag, the existing design must be included in the opinion poll. The existing design must be one of those put to the Australian people for consideration. I think that is the only fair way that this sort of matter can be considered, and I am delighted that it has also been included as part of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if some day in the future our country decides to become a republic, our flag would be none the less relevant. Surely the Southern Cross and the federation star would be just as relevant as they are today. Their symbolism would perhaps be of even greater importance. But the Union Jack would also retain its relevance. It would still reflect on our history. I have not heard too many proposals which suggest that, even if Australia were to become a republic, it would withdraw from the British Commonwealth of Nations. So that symbolism would still remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps, most importantly, our multiculturalism would still be with us even if we were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8297"> to become a republic. So it is quite appropriate that through the presence of the Union Jack on our flag we recognise the contribution of people from around the world to the country that we know and enjoy today. I believe that this flag has served us well, despite the comings and goings of government, despite wars and despite times of great hardship. And it would serve us just as well and just as effectively if the changes in the future were to include a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could fly this flag just as proudly on the day when our president or our Governor-General with different powers were sworn into office as we can today when our Head of State is a representative of the Queen of Australia. So this design will not wear out. It will not reach a magic use by date. Indeed, as the decades pass its symbolism and importance grow all the stronger. Future generations become more committed to it as they learn of the achievements of our country in the past and as they recognise their obligation as young Australians to help contribute towards building a better country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a very important tradition that has been developed in Australian schools, but is sadly falling into disuse in some places, that our flag is raised preferably every morning; that there is a pledge of allegiance; and that young people recognise that they also have commitments and responsibilities as Australian citizens. By flying the flag in positions of prominence, we recognise our commitment to our country. By raising the flag we are also making our own commitment towards making our country an even better place in which to live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude by amplifying that matter. A constituent came to me only a few weeks ago saying that the teacher of his seven&hyphen;year&hyphen;old son had raised in class whether the design of the Australian flag should be changed. The seven&hyphen;year&hyphen;old expressed dismay to his father that anyone should want to change the flag. The father, anxious to engage his son in conversation about these important matters of national spirit, asked him why we should keep the existing flag. His son's answer was quite simple but profound. He <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said, `Because it's ours.' This seven&hyphen;year&hyphen;old wanted to keep the flag because it's ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ours because it has been with Australia since our Federation. It is ours because we took it into battle. It is ours because we take it into international negotiations. It is ours because it has been with us when our sportsmen have achieved great victory. It is ours because it has been with us on occasions of great national significance. It is ours because it has been with us when there have been times of sorrow. And it is ours because Australians feel deeply committed to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will help ensure that it will stay ours and theirs for future generations unless there is a vote to change it. I commend the government on bringing this legislation before the parliament and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) for the way in which he has piloted it through this chamber. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am always terribly suspicious of people who wrap themselves in the flag or are flag wavers. I have been a member of parliament for 13 years. I have presented as many flags as anyone else in this chamber. I am always proud to present the flag. I present it to schools, to scout groups, to sporting organisations and many others. I, like others, present it to students, rotary students and exchange students going overseas. I always present the flag, and I am always pleased to present the flag. So make no mistake about that. I present as many flags as anyone else. Incidentally, in my electorate office I have the Australian flag flying in the foyer. It will remain flying there whilst ever I am a member of parliament and whilst ever it is the flag of this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8298">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a little surprised that this debate is taking place, and I am a little surprised that it is taking place in this chamber, because this side of the House has argued for other debates to take place in this chamber and they have not been permitted. The euthanasia debate, for example, was held in the Main Committee. I do not refer to it, as some people do, as side show alley. In fact, that term offends me greatly. I wish people would not refer to it in those terms because I do not regard it as side show alley. Like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, as someone who presides over that chamber from time to time, I do not regard the procedures there as any way short of the procedures here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That chamber allows a wide&hyphen;ranging debate for people who want to speak. I have seen the speakers list on this debate. It is a huge speakers list, and I would have thought that it would have been appropriate to have had this debate in the second chamber. But that was not to be. I just wonder, though, when we have had such important issues that we have been considering in the parliament over these last few days as we are winding up the parliamentary year, why it was felt necessary that this had become such an important issue to take up the time of the parliament to debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have one small difficulty with the current flag. I particularly like the Southern Cross there, but I do not like the idea of our flag of Australia having the symbol of a foreign country in the corner of it. That might not come as much of a surprise to many people. Take that symbol of another country out of our flag and I am quite happy with the Australian flag. I do not necessarily want that symbol replaced with any other symbol. I am quite happy for the flag&mdash;as it flies in this chamber&mdash;to have just the Southern Cross on it. I think that would symbolise Australia. In fact, it would symbolise Australia much more than the current flag does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that if you go out and talk to people in the street and you are carrying a New Zealand flag and an Australian flag&mdash;all these flag wavers and people who are wrapping themselves in the flag&mdash;people would have a great deal of difficulty telling the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> difference between the Australian flag and the New Zealand flag. In fact, recently, I was at an international conference&mdash;there was a New Zealand delegate and an Australian delegate there&mdash;and they had the New Zealand flag in front of me and the Australian flag in front of the New Zealand delegate. I discreetly said to the person there, `If you do not want to create an incident, I suggest you switch these two flags,' which they very quickly did and for which they apologised profusely and told me that they did not know the difference. Obviously, they did not know the difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many people have said, the flag is important to a nation. It does symbolise a nation. It does not symbolise a nation to me when you have such a large part of it taken up with the flag of another country. I strongly reject the suggestion that those of us who do not kowtow to a foreign power are somehow less loyal or less Australian or are somehow more suspect than those who wrap themselves in the flag and come in here. I cannot believe some of the things that have been said during this debate. I always reject questions such as who is more loyal&mdash;it seems to me that we get the argument somehow confused&mdash;but it seems to me that those who want their own distinct flag are, if you want to use the criterion of loyalty, more loyal than the others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other countries have gone through this debate. The interesting thing about Australia is that we think if we change our flag the world is going to stop and Australia will never be the same. Canada went through this debate. It was a very bitter debate. Canada has much greater divisions within it than this country has. It is a country that has genuine divisions in it and they went through this debate. Those of British descent wanted to keep the flag as it was, symbolising Britain the mother country, and the Canadians came up with a distinctly Canadian flag that is known throughout the world as the flag of Canada. You see the Canadian flag on the rucksacks of backpackers. If you are driving through Europe and you see a group of hitchhikers with a Union Jack, you wonder whether they are Australians, New Zealanders or British.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You might not have had that experience, but I have. There has been great debate about how we choose a flag. The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and I, among others, were in South Africa. The honourable member for Cowan and I went to the archives in Johannesburg in South Africa. While we were there, they took us to the heraldry on the top floor and we were introduced to the person who designed the new South African flag.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They said that they had held a competition and that there had been a great debate. Of course, it was a very emotive time in the history of South Africa. The person who designed the flag actually designed it over the weekend. The new South African flag&mdash;it is not so new now&mdash;really does symbolise the new nation, the post&hyphen;apartheid nation of South Africa. I do not know, but I think that competitions and things like that could be quite divisive if you had them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some members in their speeches have said that the former Prime Minister is said not to have liked the current Australian flag. I do not know if he did or if he did not, but I know that if we on this side of the House ever raised the question of a republic we were always told that we were diverting the nation's attention away from the real issues. I would suggest to those opposite that this debate today&mdash;given some of the issues that Australia is facing today and some of the issues we have been debating in this parliament over the last week&mdash;is a little bit of a diversionary tactic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sometimes wonder why those who are so keen to keep the current flag always try to silence those who want a debate on it. They are always trying to impose their views on us. Why should we accept that there will be no change to the Australian flag? As I said before, I would suggest that I am as loyal as anyone in this chamber. I give the flag the respect it deserves. In the little speeches I make to schools, I always make the point that this is the flag of Australia and, as such, it deserves respect. It symbolises the nation and it deserves respect. I always make sure I say that. But I always say that there should be a debate on whether the flag today actually <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> symbolises the nation. So I will be very pleased when we do change the flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this parliament I represent one of the most diverse electorates in Australia. It is an area that has changed greatly over the years. We in Australia are changing and we should have a flag that is much more relevant to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wide Bay said that the flag represented a chronicle of 200 years of immigration. Sure, we have had 200 years of immigration to this country and I see nothing wrong with having a flag to symbolise that 200 years of immigration. But why select one part of the world where migrants come from? Many members of this chamber can trace their ancestries back not to Britain but to Greece, Italy and other parts of the world. Why do we select one part of the world and say that this symbolises migration to Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I want to make very strongly is that I am happy to have a referendum on the issue if people want to change the flag. I believe there is nothing wrong in holding a referendum on it. I am not sure that it would get through, given the current climate, because there would be quite a divisive debate, which I think would be unfortunate. In this country, unless a question is taken out of the political arena and there is bipartisan support on it, very few referendums get through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am amazed that we have been given so much time for debate on the flag in this House. Many of us want to take a look at the history. I think we should take a look at our history. The flag that we have today has symbolised much. It has symbolised the past for Australia. It is true that we have evolved from a British colony into the modern nation that we are today. But that is really part of history. Why would we want to be in a time warp? Why are you saying we must always keep in that area? Surely it is time we had a new flag that more adequately represented Australia as it is today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wonder why we cannot have a proper debate on the flag. Those who support the current flag try to smear those who take a different point of view. It is time that we had a proper debate on the flag. As far as I am <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8300"> concerned, it is time that we had a new flag. This flag has served us well. It has symbolised much. It represents much. It should now be placed in the museum with other relics of our past. We should have a new flag that more adequately reflects Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I very much appreciate the opportunity to participate in the debate on the Flags Amendment Bill 1996 tonight and to follow my good friend, the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), whose speech I would like to comment on a little further in my presentation. This is a defining and important moment because since the Flags Act 1953 we have not provided a facility whereby if we change the flag all Australians can participate in that decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the current opposition and the former government did, we will not impose a national anthem on Australia. Even now there is disquiet as to whether that was the right choice. I am not going to canvass that tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill adds two new sections. The first, proposed new subsection 3(2), provides that the Australian national flag shall cease to be the national flag if a majority of electors in the states and territories are given a choice between the present Australian flag and a new flag or flags. I do not know what could be fairer than that. The second, proposed new subsection 3(3), provides the way in which a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposal for a referendum should be carried out. That is admirably sensible. It does not allow some demagogue like our previous Prime Minister, ipso facto, after some competition over the weekend&mdash;my colleague described the selection of the South African flag&mdash;to impose the selection of the flag on the Australian population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Throsby said that there was confusion between the Australian and New Zealand flags because of their similarity. That is a bit of a tortured argument. That is the one Gough Whitlam ran in the debate with Jim Killen some years ago because when he went to Canada once they made a mistake and put the wrong flags up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you a few other examples. I wonder whether you could show me the difference between the Dutch and the French flags, with their red, white and blue bands, if I dropped the two of them in front of you. If I gave you the German flag and three other flags that have yellow, red and black bands, I wonder whether you could put them in the right order. What about the five Scandinavian flags, which are all identical in design but different in colour? Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland all have identical designs for their flags but different backgrounds, different coloured crosses. You might pick the Finnish one because of its distinctive blue and white design, but I think you would be groping when it came to the other four. All of us would be, unless we were in the maritime game, had an interest in flags, or had access to a list of flags or an encyclopaedia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Throsby said he thinks the flag should be confined to a museum and that, because we want this matter debated in the parliament, there are more important issues and we are out of touch with the Australian people. Let me bring you back to earth. As we have often said in debate in this chamber over the last three months, it is your party which is out of kilter with the Australian public, as was very clearly demonstrated at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give an example. In the last parliament I did quite a comprehensive survey in my electorate of the things that worried <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8301"> people. These were some of the things that worried people. I will leave out the republic because that is a matter for another debate; there were protagonists for and against a republic. With regard to some other issues, 23&half; per cent were worried about the environment, 30.1 per cent supported a republic, 31.6 per cent were concerned about education, 42.4 per cent were concerned about health care and 63.2 per cent were concerned about unemployment. But the daddy of them all, the thing that most concerned people in my electorate, was that there was a move to change the flag&mdash;72 per cent.</PARA>

That survey of Queenslanders was conducted at the height of the Keating era and people were reacting against their symbols being tampered with. They were reacting against political correctness. People were looking for certainty. Nothing came through more clearly to me as I doorknocked during the last election than that Australians are looking for certainty. I repeat that figure: 72 per cent. That means, at an absolute minimum, 22 per cent of those people were Labor voters and on average probably about 36 per cent of them were Labor voters. Surely, that says something to you. In my area, I could extrapolate that between half and a third of all Labor voters were worried about this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of the Australian flag in its many parts is a magnificent story. As many speakers have said, it goes back to the red cross on the white background, the cross of St George, patron saint of England, a very old flag, and the cross of St Andrew, the white diagonal cross on a blue background, for the patron saint of Scotland&mdash;again, a very ancient flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1606 the King of England died, leaving no heirs. His closest relative was the King of Scotland. In 1606 the King of Scotland became King of England and he superimposed the cross of St Andrew on the cross of St George and created a flag called the flag of the Grand Union. That was the flag under <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which Australia was settled. Captain Cook first raised that flag at Botany Bay, on Possession Island. Later, in 1788, Captain Arthur Phillip raised it at Port Jackson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1800, Ireland joined the United Kingdom and the flag of the order of St Patrick was added. My Irish friends tell me it is not St Patrick's flag. They are quite explicit about that. They say it is not an official Irish flag; indeed, they are correct. But the flag that was known as the flag of the order of St Patrick was added. That is the little red diagonal flag that was added to the flag of the Grand Union, which then became the Union Jack. That flew until Federation, and even beyond Federation in conjunction with our own flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea of adding the Southern Cross is not new. If you look at the history of the flags, the first known flag devised in Australia was the flag of Honor Bowman of Archerfield, near Richmond. At her property she flew a flag which depicted the symbols of a kangaroo and an emu holding a shield, which has become, through two manifestations, our coat of arms. Later, in 1820, a group of seafarers sent to the Lords of the Admiralty a white flag with the red cross of St George and a star in each of the four quadrants, symbolic of the Southern Cross.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take the four stars out of the quadrants, put them at the ends of the bars and change the colour from red to blue, you have a flag very similar to the Eureka flag. So the idea of a Southern Cross and a cross that probably germinated from our European origins was set in the Australian psyche many years ago. In fact, the Anti&hyphen;Transportation League suggested a flag not unlike the one we have today, and that was as early as 1851, with the Union Jack in one corner and a yellow Southern Cross, without the Star of Federation or the Commonwealth Star, sitting against a blue background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many speakers have said, in 1901 there was a competition in which there were 32,823 entries. There were five winners who suggested a flag almost identical to the one we have today. Indeed, the Commonwealth Star or the Federation Star had six spikes. That was our flag from 1901, approved by King Edward VII in 1903. Then, in 1909, in recognition of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8302"> the fact that Papua had come under our control and also that there were other territories under the control of the Commonwealth, the seventh spike was added to the star. That was approved by the King a year later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) said, there was always a certain amount of confusion in the early days of Federation about whether the official Australian flag was the one with the red ensign or the one with the dark blue ensign. If you look at paintings of the First World War you frequently see the Australian troops going into battle carrying the red version. As the member for Moncrieff said, the painting of the original photograph of the opening of federal parliament showed a red ensign. In a subsequent version of that painting it was changed to blue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An unofficial rule until about 1941 was that the blue ensign was used on official occasions and on official buildings and the red ensign was used by the maritime services and private citizens. In 1941, the then Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, suggested that the blue flag be used. Cabinet made a decision on that matter in 1951 which was confirmed by the Flag Act 1953.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not until 1967 that the Royal Australian Navy used the white ensign. It previously used the British navy's white ensign. In 1948, the RAAF petitioned George VI for the light blue ensign with the roundel in the bottom right corner to be the ensign of the RAAF. Interestingly, it was 1981 before the red kangaroo was added, with the approval of the Queen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of history and a lot of development has gone on in this area. In many ways, that parallels our development. I am not saying that things are immutable and that things cannot change, but I am a great believer that things should evolve and not be pushed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there has been a tendency to try to create history. I think the Turnbull committee was a disgrace. The concept of the committee was not and Turnbull himself is not, but the committee was set up to examine whether we should become a republic without a counterbalance of continuing with our current constitution and monarchy. The previous Prime Minister seemed to want lop-sided arguments <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all the time. The Murdoch competition did not offer the current Australian flag as an alternative to the ones it was suggesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People do not take very kindly to their Australian symbols being tampered with. The amount of controversy surrounding the two forms of the Olympic 2000 flag is evidence enough of this. In the short time since the first Olympic flag, which was on our ties, was developed, we now have a second one which is already embroiled in controversy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I find strange is that there is a tendency by my opposition colleagues to want to repaint history in the mould of Paul Keating's vision. I remember the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">True Believers</EMPHASIS> television series, which I found very interesting and would not knock for a minute. But something that always disturbed me was that the old newsreels were reworked using Kevin Golby's voice but with new scripts. Even some of the critics mistook those new scripts for the old scripts and re&hyphen;imposed another sense of history on us. We have to be very careful how we handle these sorts of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 72 per cent of the people surveyed in my electorate said that this was the greatest single issue that concerned them. As I go round to schools, I find that there is not only trouble sometimes with literacy and numeracy but also great ignorance of our symbols and the history of our symbols. I have only gone to one school in my electorate that could tell me what the four ensigns represented&mdash;the dark blue, the red, the white and the light blue. I think that is sad. When you tell the kids stories about the flags, the coat of arms, the wattle, the opal&mdash;all the rich symbols of Australia&mdash;and how they were developed their faces light up. We do not inculcate those in our kids as do the British, the Americans and, in more recent times, the Canadians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take a great deal of satisfaction in supporting the Flags Amendment Bill 1996. It psychologically enshrines in the minds of all Australians the need that all Australians should be consulted if there is ever going to be any change to the flag. I think it also lays down a proper mechanism whereby Australians will be given a choice of flag.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8303">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see the Union Jack in the corner of the flag as a symbol of oppression or sycophancy, I see it purely as a symbol of where our parliamentary system of government came from and where our rule of law came from. A lot of people from non&hyphen;British nations who have settled in Australia also see that as a great symbol. They came here for the security, the rule of law, the peace, the lifestyle that it embodies. I remember a TV interview one night with a young man who was fifth generation Irish. He wanted to know why we wanted to change our flag. I find the same problem. I will readily embrace whatever the Australian public decide at a referendum. I commend this bill, which gives the maximum amount of choice to Australian people, to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to draw attention to what will be known as the National Student Leadership Forum on Faith and Values. This is an initiative primarily of a constituent of mine, Mr Peter Pickles, and his wife, Sue. It is also supported by business and community members and facilitated by a group of members and senators from the federal parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those members, of which I am one, with Mr Pickles and his colleagues will be conducting the forum here in Canberra from 13 February to 16 February 1997 at the Rydges Lakeside Hotel and also in Parliament House. I think credit also needs to be given in particular to Mr Jock Cameron, the brother of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), who has actually been doing a lot of work in organising the forum. We are hopeful that our national political leaders will be addressing the forum. The forum is about nurturing leadership qualities in young Australians in their late teens and early 20s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time of year which is usually characterised by prize-giving night speeches&mdash;with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which I know honourable members will be only too familiar&mdash;and young people making decisions about careers, I think it is worth saying a few things about success and leadership, which will be themes addressed by the forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been asked in recent years about success&mdash;in particular, by young doctors about success in medicine&mdash;and I would like to share with the House some reflections that I have upon it. I think it is important that we all remember that, no matter how old or wise we may think we are, many of the facts that we now learn, the things we believe to be facts, will become superseded and those that are not superseded we will forget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, for young people in particular, I think it is worth remembering that your final achievements in life eventually depend on your continuing ability to acquire new knowledge, the inner integrity of your intellect&mdash;something which is destroyed, of course, through experimentation with drugs&mdash;and the humanity with which you deal with other people. As they say, those who give the most in life are those who receive much more than they give. In the end, people are remembered not for what they know but for who they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For young people also, I think it is worth remembering that success is not measured by the number of degrees that you accumulate, the wealth that you may also accumulate as you go through life, nor by the spectrum of people whom you know. If you look throughout the community and society to those for whom we have the highest regard, it is those who have fought for the things in which they believe. Facing adversity and hardship and, at times, criticism in their chosen fields, these are people who persevered in making the lives of the rest of us perhaps that much better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In choosing a career, which is something that many young people are doing at the moment, I have certainly found that it is helpful to ask yourself the question: `When I get to the end of my working life, is this the sort of career which I feel will have made my life worth while? Is it one in which I  will have been of greatest service to others?' That of course is something which gives people the greatest satisfaction with their lives&mdash;no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8304"> matter what field of endeavour they may pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering the issues of leadership throughout the forum, we will be considering precisely what it is about and trying to nurture these kinds of values in young people in particular and, in doing so, relate them to a sense of values and perhaps a faith in something greater than themselves. Essentially, I believe that leadership is a presence that attracts other people to follow and to participate in a common cause. It is not about charisma, as the St James Ethics Centre reminds us, but it is an infectious wish to bring about positive things for the good of the community and for the country. Leadership is about engendering and evoking in others a genuine enthusiasm for overcoming their own self&hyphen;interest and supporting those things that are in the best long&hyphen;term interests of society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be thinking about things like ethics. We will be encouraging people to be at ease with themselves, to be motivated by a sense of duty and responsibility. We will  encourage clear&hyphen;minded decisiveness in young people and the courage to achieve. I urge honourable members to bring forward names of young people in their electorates who they feel may be interested and suitable for such a forum. We will be looking for energy, wit, commonsense, integrity, self-restraint, humility and openness in the young people who come.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.35 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the year draws to a close, I would like to reflect on the fact that this year, 1996, is the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. It is also the year that John Howard was swept into office with massive support from Australians, particularly those battling and blue&hyphen;collar Australians who deserted the Labor Party in droves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Australia has always been the lucky country. But for some Australians the luck has run out. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that the poorest 10 per cent of Australian households struggle on an average gross income of $5,230 per annum; that the average income of the poorest 30 per cent of house holds is less than $10,000 per annum; and that half of Australian households live on $24,000 or less per annum. It is therefore no surprise that a recent Smith Family study into poverty showed that as many as 30 per cent of Australians are living in poverty. These facts should greatly concern all members of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June this year, I was shocked to read a UNICEF report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Progress of Nations</EMPHASIS>, which outlined that Australia is one of five industrialised nations to have more than 10 per cent of its children living in poverty. This comes just a few years after that immortal line by former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who said, `No Australian child will be living in poverty by 1990.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well known that one of the main causes of poverty is unemployment. And there is no denying that members opposite presided over some of the highest unemployment rates in this nation's history. It is also well known that the best way to alleviate poverty is the creation of secure, full&hyphen;time jobs. But real jobs can be created only if we free up the labour market and get small business back on its feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workplace relations bill is the start of a more sensible and flexible labour market for our country. Since the Howard government has come into office, three interest rate cuts have meant great news for people battling to pay their monthly mortgage and for young families who have put off buying their first home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further good news comes in the announcement of a safety net increase of $24 a week, phased in over three years, to low paid workers. And many families, particularly those with young children, will benefit from our family tax initiative which comes into effect from 1 January 1997 and delivers an extra $34 per fortnight of disposable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see, Mr Speaker, that our aim on this side of the House is to raise people out of the poverty trap into which they have fallen through no fault of their own over the last decade of Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since last week, my electorate office has been contacted by many people who have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8305"> found it extremely difficult to cope with purchasing basic foods, let alone presents for their children this Christmas. We can help these people in the short term by providing special food hampers, but it does not change the fact that their situation is desperate all year round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many Australians do not understand just how bad it is for the 1.8 million poor who hide their poverty because they are too embarrassed to ask for help. In recent years there has been an increasing number of working poor who are not eligible for concessions but who also do not earn enough money to make ends meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Traditionally, welfare agencies provided short&hyphen;term emergency relief. Yet during the past few years charities and social welfare agencies have been increasingly requested to prop up low income families to cover their basic living costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to acknowledge some special people who bring happiness over the Christmas period to those families who are struggling to get by. Father Brian Morrison, a tireless worker, is this year launching his 20th Christmas appeal. Graham Maybury, of the Livingstone Foundation, has distinguished himself by being a friend and helper to many throughout my electorate of Canning. Then there is Keith Tyson, from the Gosnells Salvation Army. Keith and I have worked together many times at Christmas, preparing Christmas hampers for locals in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are far too many others to mention, but what would our community do without these wonderful people who, together with the members of their organisations, volunteer their services.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition government has not only recognised the wonderful work carried out by such organisations, but also increased spending on youth homelessness, emergency relief and several other welfare programs. Solutions to alleviate poverty rest not only with the government and service providers, but also with members of our community. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<ELECTORATE> (Wills)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.40 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to express some concern in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> House tonight that the government's announcement today concerning the future of the petroleum industry will do nothing to guarantee the future livelihood and wellbeing of some 9,000 service station operators who sell, service and repair Australia's motor vehicle fleet. I refer to the members of the Motor Trades Association of Australia and also those involved in service stations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had recommended to the government that the petroleum industry's price surveillance regulations be removed and that the two petroleum specific acts, the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980, be repealed. In fact, we need the opposite&mdash;that legislation needs to be strengthened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most honourable members should have received two pieces of correspondence from the Motor Trades Association of Australia and from the Service Station Association Ltd which bear this out very strongly. They indicate that to date oil companies have not shown that they are willing to negotiate in good faith on matters of importance to service station operators. The situation is so serious that the directors of the Motor Trades Association of Australia decided at their meeting in October to withdraw immediately from Oilcode.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Oilcode was established back in 1989, those who became parties to it did so on the understanding that it would be underpinned by the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act rather than be a substitute for that act. So Oilcode has relied for its existence upon the acts and therefore cannot substitute for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a matter of concern that service station operators are excluded from all of the state and territory tenancy acts because tenure is provided by the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act. Repeal of these acts would mean that service station operators have no tenure, no legal rights with respect to renewals, non&hyphen;renewals or any other of the elements of their commercial relationship with those franchisors unless they are provided by contract, which they never have been.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8306">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter of considerable concern, as have been the proposals for the entry of new parties like Woolworths to the petroleum market in circumstances where the competition would not be fair because they would have a buying advantage as against the franchise service station operators who are tied to their franchisor for 100 per cent of their supplies for petroleum markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in those circumstances, with Woolworths expected to open an estimated 250 petrol outlets, the industry will be subjected to significant structural adjustment through attrition, quite probably through bankruptcy, and quite possibly many service stations will close with the loss of a great many jobs. So in these circumstances we need some changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had strong recommendations from the Service Station Association concerning the need for price access to untie supply in order to keep oligopolies and the major oil companies honest over the long term. We need the supply untied but we also need legislation to protect franchisees. In this regard it is important that the federal parliament's inquiry into fair trading come down with appropriate recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past oil companies have not made adequate disclosure to franchisees. They have harshly and unilaterally altered franchise agreements without the prior agreement of or even in consultation with the franchisees concerned. In those circumstances, franchisees are often the economic captives of the franchisor and they do not get a fair go. As a result, there is a need for legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act to specifically prohibit harsh or oppressive commercial conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need price access by untying supply to allow 50 per cent of fuel to be competitively outsourced. We should update the petroleum acts into one effective petroleum act and support a stronger petroleum code of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disappointing that the government's announcement this afternoon said absolutely nothing about the future of those involved in petrol retailing in this country. I am concerned that, if the government does not turn its mind to these issues, a great many people who are involved in petrol stations will go out of business or will continue to be the victims <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the oil company's abuse of the market power which it has.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Western Australian Labor Party has promised to wind back the industrial relations clock by four years by promising to remove the industrial relations reforms on workplace agreements if it is elected this Saturday, 14 December. This is yet another indication that the Australian Labor Party is an industrial relations dinosaur when it comes to workplace reform. It is a step back into the dark ages of workplace regimentation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All informed workers and hence voters in this Saturday's Western Australian election will be aware that the award is, quite rightly, the safety net provision for workers. Without the flexibility of the workplace agreements provisions, workers are locked into a very rigid pay deal which gives them little chance to better their pay and conditions. Dr Gallop's proposals should scare the living daylights out of Western Australian workers when they contemplate his returning them to the dark ages of industrial relations, especially those tens of thousands of Western Australian workers already happily employed on individual contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is there really another agenda? Prior to the 1993 Western Australian election, the former ALP labor relations minister, Yvonne Henderson, stated that it was her party's and her intention that all WA workers would be compelled to join a union. Yes, the ALP were going to make union membership in Western Australia compulsory. Yvonne Henderson and the former Lawrence ALP government were keen supporters of the draconian no ticket, no start mentality in the Western Australian work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is this what Geoff Gallop and the state ALP want to return WA workers to? Under the Court coalition government, Western Australian workers have had a choice. This flexibility in the Western Australian work force has seen WA workers achieving great take-home pay and the ability to earn more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It has seen the union hobnail boot taken from the throat of the worker, but small <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8307"> business and employers need the ability to make localised and personal decisions about mutually agreed pay and conditions, and the flexibility to negotiate and trade off to achieve these ends. There is no creditable economic commentator in this country who does not agree that the Australian work force in general must become more flexible before greater and sustained growth can occur and that this flexibility in the labour force will see a genuine reduction in unemployment, and youth unemployment in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Few workers and employers in Western Australia would disagree that the coalition's current workplace policy strikes a good balance between productivity and fairness. It allows workers to negotiate agreements on an individual basis. Alternatively, if the worker wants to be employed under the award, they can choose to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Geoff Gallop, by wanting to impose collective bargaining on workplace agreements, chooses to ignore the fact that 70 per cent of the Western Australian work force does not belong to a union. These people want the individual flexibility to negotiate their own set of conditions which they want to factor to their personal circumstances. For example, a mum wanting to start work after nine and finish at 3.30 p.m. can do so under a flexible agreement&mdash;so she can take her kids to and from school&mdash;if agreed terms and conditions are negotiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other 30 per cent making up the unionised work force can choose to negotiate with the union as their agent at this moment in Western Australia, if that is their choice. However, I am not convinced that all of that 30 per cent union membership in Western Australia would choose to select the collective arrangement with the union as their agent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I declare that Dr Gallop should stop pandering to the Western Australian unions. I say to Western Australians: don't vandalise the productivity gains and wages growth that have been achieved under a more flexible workplace agreements program in Western Australia; don't victimise or terrorise those workers whose individual and legal right it is to choose the flexibility and productivity that go with the Court government's Workplace <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Agreement Act. I say to Dr Gallop: stop beating up on the workers for crass political mileage. Give Western Australia back to a creditable coalition government that has run its workplace the way that a progressive government should do.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

The first concerns a purchase by the 11-year-old son of one of my constituents, who was a member of a school delegation from Caves Beach Public School to the parliament and to the Australian War Memorial on 15 October. During that visit he bought and took back home to his mother what he thought was Australia's symbol, the kangaroo, and what he thought was an Australian flag. It is a very poor representation of the Australian flag. When you look at the label on the kangaroo, it reads:</PARA></TALK.START>

Please have a look, Minister, to see what can be done about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter is totally different. It is one that I feel very deeply about. I ask all other members of the parliament to join with me this evening in paying tribute to the four miners who had their lives snatched from them in the tragic mine disaster at Gretley Colliery near Wallsend at about 5.30 a.m. on 15 November last. The four men were:  48-year-old Edward Batterham of Teralba, which is in the electorate of Charlton; 36&hyphen;year&hyphen;old John Hunter and 30&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Mark Kaiser, both of Belmont; and 19-year-old Damon <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8308"> Murray of Redhead. The latter three were all from my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here in the parliament of Australia, I want to place on record the courage of those four Australians. They worked in a hostile environment&mdash;as do all underground miners. They worked in conditions under pressures and dangers which would not be tolerated, even understood, by many members of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were decent, honourable Australians doing their everyday job of work. How they died and why they were engulfed in the sudden torrent of water that broke through the coalface is yet to be established. I want to convey to each member of the four families involved and to the loved ones of each of the deceased my deepest sympathy at their tragic loss. Miners are so often derided as underworked and overpaid, mostly by people who have no conception whatsoever of mining conditions and the bonds between miners&mdash;the bonds that are so utterly essential to their survival underground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mining is a dangerous occupation. The risk of injury is seven times greater than any other industry, yet there are Rambo mine owners, mine managements and mine associations which claim that the safe working regulations, the safety practices, are too tough, too stringent; that mine safety should be deregulated; and that mine safety practices should be left to the determination of individual mine managements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is scarcely a family in the Hunter that is not in some way linked to mining. My two eldest sons work underground, so I feel it particularly. Since 1847, some 1,532 miners have died in mining accidents in the Newcastle area. The grief of the Hunter and the pain that is shared was    evident at the emotional and crowded memorial service conducted on Wednesday, 27 November at the Sacred Heart Cathedral, Hamilton. The service was conducted by the Catholic bishop Michael Malone and the Anglican bishop Roger Herft. It was attended by the Governor of New South Wales, His Excellency Gordon Samuels, the New South Wales Premier, members from both sides of the New South Wales parliament plus many other members of parliament both state and federal. We <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> honoured those four miners; we honoured their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry is tough and dangerous and the rules  governing its safe working conditions must be correspondingly tough. I have heard various explanations of the cause of the flooding of the coalface where the four men were working. There were old workings nearby dating back to the 1920s. The maps, it appears, may have been wrongly marked. I am told that approximately a 4-feet by 4-feet hole burst through the coalface and they were engulfed with the enormous force that came through, that water, about 100 metres under ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am encouraged that the honourable member for Port Stephens, the Minister for Mineral Resources, Mr Bob Martin, has established a judicial inquiry to be conducted by Mr James Staunton, the former District Court judge who conducted the Seaview Air commission of inquiry. I ask other members of the parliament to join with me in an expression of grief, comfort and condolence to the members of the families of the four deceased.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak tonight about some of the wonderful people of Petrie. It is with very great sadness that I speak about the passing of Mr Lindsay Meyers. The St Peter the Fisherman's Anglican church at Clontarf was packed on Monday with hundreds of people for the funeral of Redcliffe businessman and community activist Lindsay Meyers. Mr Meyers died last Thursday aged 71 after fighting a very long battle with motor neurone disease. He is very sadly missed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Meyers was born in Maryborough, attended the Gympie High School and joined scouts at a very young age. He had a very long and active involvement in the scouting <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8309"> movement. For that, he was duly recognised as a district commissioner and a regional commissioner. He was also assistant chief commissioner and Brisbane North area commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the war he became a saw doctor and married Molly McMillan. They had a home in Redcliffe for many years. They have two children, Kathryn and Russell. He was very keen on tennis and was a very active member of the Redcliffe Tennis Association, where he was president for five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1972 to 1975 the family was situated in Papua New Guinea where Mr Meyers oversaw the establishment of a planing mill for Papua New Guinea softwoods. On many occasions since my time as the member for Petrie, he lobbied me about the importation of these wood products from overseas&mdash;quite heavily, I might add&mdash;so I was in constant contact with him. He was a man of great energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a member of the Papua New Guinea Apprentice Board. He also set up three scout groups in Papua New Guinea. He returned to Redcliffe where he bought the Dunstan's Planing Mill on Anzac Avenue and he went into joint partnership with an English firm to fingerjoint timber and produce mouldings. They are very well known throughout the Petrie electorate for this work. His son, Russell, now manages the family business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After some time, Mr Meyers sold out and decided to help his son. He then joined the Queensland Timber Board Merchants Division where he was elected to the Queensland Forest Industry Training Council to help young people train in the timber industry, and he was noted for the great work he did in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a charter member of the Kippa&hyphen;Ring Rotary Club and was awarded one of Rotary's highest honours&mdash;the Paul Harris Fellowship. I have had a number of events and functions organised by Mr Meyers and have had a great involvement with Rotary as well. As if that was not enough, he was a member of the Alcohol and Drug Foundation Redcliffe branch and became Queensland branch treasurer. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will always remember him as a man of great energy and great dedication. He always had a smile. He was respected by all in the Redcliffe community, and was also willing to help anyone who needed a hand. I pass on my sincerest condolences and sympathy to his wife, Molly, and his children, Russell and Kathryn. He will be sadly missed by all in Redcliffe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight, I also want to speak about another outstanding person in Redcliffe&mdash;a wonderful person by the name of Sister Mary Agnese Redford, who will be celebrating 60 years since she was professed. This is her diamond jubilee as a sister of the Good Samaritan order. She celebrates 60 years as a sister, having been ordained on 12 January 1937&mdash;60 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She is very well respected at the Ballycara aged care complex, which I visit on a regular basis. I have met with sister there on a number of occasions. We are very delighted to share in her wonderful achievement. She is very much loved there.

I think it was very mean&hyphen;spirited for him not to understand the difficulties that the workers of Howe Leather and their families face, especially in the run-up to Christmas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a minister who needs to understand that, in a region like the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne where, over the last three months, unemployment has increased from 10 per cent to 13 per cent, there is a great degree <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8310"> of uncertainty. There is uncertainty because the minister will not take the lead on industry policy and explain to the Australian work force what this government is going to do about the intractable problems of the manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another project in the electorate of Scullin that gives scope for increased employment opportunities is the development of the Janefield land where there is a proposal to have an automotive components technology park that depends on support from not only industry but also local, state and federal government. I urge the minister to consider being involved in that project to ensure that it goes ahead.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.00 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure for me this morning to talk on the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing Australia's World Heritage</EMPHASIS> , handed down by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I do so as a member of that committee, but with an apology as well. I became a member of this committee only this year, and have done so in my capacity more as a shadow minister for sport than as somebody with the prerequisite to be concerned principally with environmental matters. As a consequence, I did not participate in too many of the inquiry discussions on this matter. In fact, history will show that it was work largely done in the previous parliament by the former committee&mdash;and carried on ably, I might say, under the direction of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) in the present parliament&mdash;which has seen this document produced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, I would say that this again gives an indication of how effective parliamentary committees can be in looking at very important issues in the national parliament and making recommendations which we hope the government would like to act upon. It is specifically on the area of World Heritage recommendations that have flowed from this report and the way that government might operate and might take cognisance of those reports that I want to make some comments today. One of the most important World Heritage areas that Australia possesses is, amongst many others, the Great Barrier Reef. Therefore, I am sure it will come as no surprise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, or to my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay, the chairman of the committee that is with us today, that I take this opportunity to make some comments about the management of the Great Barrier Reef, about the recommendations that are contained in this document, and about what I perceive to be some very misguided policy direction which the government has chosen to adopt as a result of budget constraints and the need to raise revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, I refer more generally to what has become known as the reef tax issue in North Queensland. Interestingly, the committee did in fact touch on this issue, at about page 183 of the report, where they talked about the reef tax. At paragraph 8.40 and subsequent paragraphs, the report lists a couple of the concerns which I have about the implementation of that proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To refresh members' memories, I remind you that the proposal for an increase in the reef tax, or the environmental management charge, first surfaced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget. As members would know, a $1 charge had been placed by the former government on the use of marine facilities by visitors to the reef; that is, the major tour operators using boats to take visitors out to the reef charged an extra $1 as an environmental management charge, and the proceeds of that were to go to the management of the reef itself and to aid in ensuring that the environmental purity of the area was not denigrated to any extent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8313">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, regrettably, has seen that charge as something of a milch cow: in the budget it was announced that there was to be a 500 per cent increase in the reef tax, to take effect from 1 January 1997. Quite rightly, the local operators in the tourism industry were up in arms about this decision. They were up in arms because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had, during the election campaign, stood in Cairns in the midst of the tourism operators and had told them categorically that not only would there be no increases in taxes and no new taxes introduced by his government but also that in tourism specifically, and in respect of the reef tax, there would be no change. To say that the tourism operators felt betrayed by the Prime Minister and that they questioned his credibility as a result of the 500 per cent increase mooted in the budget is an understatement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As time went on we saw that this issue gained momentum, particularly in five electorates on the North Queensland coast. We saw that the local members, either Liberal or National Party, came under considerable pressure from the tourism operators and their constituents to have this decision overturned. They seemed to make grandiose promises whilst they were in their electorates but, unfortunately, when they came to Canberra they must have remained reasonably silent because they certainly have not delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw that constant requests from our side of politics for this issue to be reviewed and debated in the parliament were rebutted on every occasion. Parliamentary tactics were used to shut me down when I tried to bring motions to the parliament or bring matters of public importance to the notice of the parliament. There were four separate occasions when that happened. It was quite obvious that the government was running scared on this matter, which the committee rightly identified in its report as one of major concern. As a consequence, we had extraordinary scenes. For example, an organisation in Far North Queensland actually came out and said that the minister responsible, Robert Hill, should be sacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following an announcement of a review of the operations of GBRMPA&mdash;the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority&mdash;which is covered in this World Heritage report, Steven Moon, General Manager of Ocean Spirit Cruises and spokesman of the Cairns&hyphen;based Marine Tourism Industry, said in a press release that that was nice, but it had nothing to do with the reef tax. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are calling on the Prime Minister to intervene in this issue not only to resolve it once and for all but also to maintain his own integrity after promising the industry in Cairns this would not happen.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Moon also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is imperative that Senator Hill be asked to surrender his portfolio to a more competent and efficient member of government to maintain any credibility for any future negotiations that may be required with industry. The feeling at this time is the government cannot be trusted.</PARA>
<PARA>This was from the industry which had gotten behind the coalition in these five seats in the last election on the back of a promise that the reef tax would not be increased, and suddenly felt betrayed. And that press release had followed another, under the heading of `Promises, promises, broken promises!' which had been issued in September by tourism operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact was that, behind the scenes, the pressure was starting to tell because John Moore, the minister for tourism&mdash;who is, after all, a Queenslander&mdash;and also Minister Robert Hill did have some meetings with the operators in Queensland. That was the first sign of any consultation he had with them. Interestingly enough, at five seconds to midnight, literally&mdash;on the day before President Clinton's visit&mdash;a press release was slotted out by Robert Hill saying, `We have had a change of heart and we are going to have a two&hyphen;for&hyphen;one tax.' It is not just <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8314"> going to be an increase by 500 per cent in one hit; we are going to have a two&hyphen;for&hyphen;one tax. `We will increase the reef tax, the EMC, from $1 to $2 to start on 1 January 1997 and then'&mdash;interestingly enough&mdash;`there will be a new $4 tourist visitor charge levied on users of commercial facilities and craft from 1 January 1998.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My maths tells me that is still going to be $6. My maths tells me that, in 1998, it will still amount to a 500 per cent increase. But, interestingly, it raises some other problems for the minister. A $4 tourist visitor charge is only going to apply to Queensland and it is only going to apply to users of the Great Barrier Reef. So it is anti&hyphen;Queensland and anti&hyphen;tourism, and it is supported by a minister who comes from Queensland&mdash;the minister for tourism, John Moore. After Minister Hill put out his press release, Mr Moore put out a press release saying this was a great idea. His press release said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Moore said today's announcement was a win for the tourism industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>What a joke that is, because the tourism industry did not see it that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We found out that that little proposal was actually floated by Senator O'Chee and the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) at a secret soiree&mdash;which was not so secret&mdash;in Cairns on 11 November. I just happened to be up there at the time and I knew that it was on. It was on at 8.30 in the morning and these two guys&mdash;a couple of boys on a man's errand&mdash;went along to try and convince the tourism operators they should accept this so&hyphen;called compromise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> the next day said it all: `Compromise over reef tax rejected.' The tourism operators said, `This just won't work. You are still going to give us a $6 increase management fee reef tax.' The thing that is even more worrying for the tourism industry&mdash;and which is rightly pointed to in that section of the report which we are debating here this morning&mdash;goes to the question of the new $4 tourist visitor charge. I do not care how you dress it up, that is an increased tax; it is a new tax. And that goes counter to everything that this government has said about no new taxes and no increases in existing taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is something even more sinister in this&mdash;and people have not cottoned on to this yet. The reef tax, as it is now, is levied on people who get on one of the Quicksilver or Ocean Spirit cruises and go out to have a look at the Great Barrier Reef. I did it myself. I took my family out there in April of this year. You get on the boat and go out to the Reef. You get snorkel equipment and you paddle around and have a great look at the Reef. It is a fabulous experience. It is one of the main reasons why we are attracting so many tourists to Australia, particularly from markets in the Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But now we find that the press release that Senator Hill has put out and which Minister Moore thinks is fabulous&mdash;this is a Queenslander supporting an anti&hyphen;Queensland tax&mdash;says that this new $4 tourist visitor charge is going to be levied on users of `commercial facilities and craft'. What does that mean? Does it mean it is not now going to just apply to the vessels that go out, but also to commercial facilities in our tourism mecca of North Queensland? To me it means that it can also be levied on restaurants and hotels. This is a de facto bed tax dressed up as some sort of an environmental management charge. The words are not mine; the words are directly from this media release from Senator Robert Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a joke. In this report on the managing of Australia's World Heritage, on that same page which I referred to earlier, it goes on to say that this charge should not be just levied upon the people that it was formerly levied upon; the tax should not just simply be on them. It talks about any users of the Reef. It talks about the recreational boat users&mdash;people that are in single craft up there.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8315">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is quite interesting, because on 23 May 1995, John Moore, who was then the Shadow Minister for Industry, Commerce and Public Administration in the opposition&mdash;but, again, still a Queensland member of this parliament&mdash;and who now is the Minister for Tourism, purporting to represent Queensland tourism, wrote to the Independent Boat Owners Association and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your recent correspondence regarding the introduction of an environment management charge or reef tax. I appreciate you writing to me on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>I bet he did. He stated further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to assure you that the Liberal Party is opposed to the introduction of an environment management charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once again, thank you for raising your concerns with me.</PARA>
<PARA>I know we all write letters and say things occasionally that come back to haunt us. This letter will come back to haunt John Moore. Quite clearly, the report, in its recommendation that the reef tax should apply not only to people using the Ocean Spirit or Quicksilver boats, on page 184, paragraph 8.43 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that a joint State/Commonwealth review of fees applied to users of the reef region should be carried out, with a view to recommendations being made on how a single fee could be applied to all users of the reef that incorporates in an equitable manner charges for those purposes for which each user accesses the reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the recommendation coming from the committee&mdash;chaired by someone, I might say, who has done an excellent job in this report&mdash;suggests that all users of the reef now be levied the increases in the reef tax.</PARA>

We will be moving against that when it comes both to the House and in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again go to this fact about commercial facilities and craft. My beef is not with the committee and the committee chairman, because I think the committee, in the process of looking at the issues, came to decisions based on the information contained in reports that were given to them. My concern is that the minister has not responded, for example, to the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> of Sunday, 24 November, talking about the reef tax being introduced and being anti&hyphen;Queensland, anti&hyphen;tourism and anti&hyphen;jobs. That editorial has to be rammed home to both these ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by simply saying again that I think the report itself in general is very good. Regrettably, I do not think enough time was spent on the reef tax issue. It is only a couple of pages and about three paragraphs, and not all its ramifications were considered. I note that none of the members who represent the North Queensland seats made any representations to the committee for consideration, but that is their prerogative and fits into the pattern that they have been adopting here. This tax will be opposed by the opposition when it comes before both chambers for deliberation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the report. Let me at the outset thank the members of the committee for their contribution to this particular report. I think it is a report of considerable substance. The honourable member who has just spoken, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), acknowledged that the reef tax took only one or two pages. That is because there were many other issues of at least equal significance&mdash;I would argue greater significance&mdash;on which the committee spent a great deal of its time in preparing the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay tribute to the former chairman of the committee, John Langmore, who resigned from this parliament on Friday. Unfortunately, not many of us were given an opportunity to speak following his valedictory comments. On behalf of the Environment, Recreation and the Arts Committee, I would like to recognise his considerable contribution to the committee as its chairman. I had the honour to be his deputy for quite a period of his term as chairman, and I always found him to be extremely fair, a very caring person, a very pleasant person, who went to great lengths to ensure that the committee was able to consider issues in a balanced and responsible way. John Langmore came into the parliament, from memory, in 1984. He was a member of the committee from 16 October 1991 and became chairman from 4 June 1992, until the change of government precluded his continuation in that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John took a keen interest in social, environmental and particularly economic issues. He was the author of a number of books and was very highly regarded by all members in the House. It could be argued that he was not a man of his time. He was advocating interventionist policies at a time when the trend was towards deregulation, he had a particular interest in social policy when economic issues seemed to be the priority, and he believed in equality at a time when there was a growing variation between rich and poor. But I think John contributed greatly to the intellectual and philosophical debates of the parliament. I congratulate him on the very high post that he has achieved at the United Nations. I know he will fulfil his responsibilities there capably and he will be a wonderful ambassador for Australia and contribute once more to his country in that post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I acknowledge with gratitude the contribution of John Langmore and the previous committee in developing this report. In that regard I would like to also mention a couple of other members of the committee who were not here to see it presented: Neville Newell, Bob Chynoweth and Bob Horne from the Labor Party, who took a keen interest in this inquiry and participated in many of the inspections; and particularly also Bruce Lloyd. He was one of those who were really at the forefront in instigating this inquiry and who were also very diligent in participating in its public hearings. He was, because of his retirement from parliament, not here to see it presented. I did arrange for him to get a copy of the report and he spoke enthusiastically about its recommendations and was delighted to see that it had come to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that Australia is a wonderful country with tremendous resources and wonderful scenic attractions. Perhaps that is no better illustrated than by our involvement with the World Heritage Convention. The World Heritage Convention came into force in 1975. Australia was one of the first signatories and now there are 146 countries that are a party to the convention, which makes it one of the most significant international conventions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were 469 properties on the World Heritage list as of December 1995. Of those, 102 are natural sites and it is an interesting statistic that 11 of those 102 sites are in Australia. So of the 102 most notable places in the world, an incredible 11 are in Australia. That says a great <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8317"> deal about our scenic and natural attributes but also about our special responsibilities to care effectively for our World Heritage areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key elements that was apparent in the evidence the committee received and, indeed, was an underlying theme throughout all of the deliberations of the committee, was that Australia, particularly in the early stages of the World Heritage Convention, was extremely enthusiastic about nominating areas. However, our enthusiasm for nomination was not extended to a commitment to the management and funding and adequate caring for the areas that we had nominated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, around the country, very negative attitudes started to develop towards World Heritage listing. There was almost a fear in the community whenever it was suggested that an area should be nominated for the list. In my own region, which probably has had more potential World Heritage nominations than any other electorate in the country, the issues became so significant that I prepared a guide on World Heritage listing to explain what it actually meant. I did so to try to explain to the people in my constituency that World Heritage listing did not mean giving the land away to the Libyans or having people from Paris come in and say what we could do and run the day-to-day affairs of the community. On the other hand, I needed to explain that some of the extravagant claims that were being made by supporters of World Heritage listing, namely, that it meant automatic tourism and the showering of money from Commonwealth and state governments, were also inaccurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has always been the case that the only way to attract tourists to an area is to provide appropriate facilities and happy tourism experiences. The word then spreads from one to another that this is a great place to visit. In fact, there is quite a deal of evidence to show that at some sites World Heritage listing has actually led to a drop in the number of tourists. It is an issue that has been oversold in some areas as a benefit for World Heritage listing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, some of the fears that have been instilled in communities are, frankly, irresponsible and have not been borne out by the facts. I have not noticed any extra Libyans wandering around Fraser Island since it has been nominated, and that is clearly the case everywhere. However, I think that the Commonwealth and the states, but particularly the Commonwealth, failed for the first decade or more of World Heritage listing to adequately explain what it meant and to take the local communities into their confidence when an area was proposed for nomination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has therefore recommended that in the future, before an area is nominated, there needs to be thorough and active community consultation. We need to win the support of the community and a part of that process needs to be to develop the management plan in advance. It was always intended under the World Heritage Convention that the management plan be submitted as a part of the nomination, but that did not really happen in Australia's case. In fact, we had the farcical case, the international embarrassment, of the Willandra Lakes which was all that is bad about the World Heritage listing process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Willandra Lakes case was a rushed nomination that was clearly made for political purposes. We got the boundaries wrong and the most important parts were left out of the area nominated for World Heritage listing. There was no commitment to funding. Some state bureaucrats incorrectly advised us that landowners could no longer use the land. This has festered for more than a decade but, finally, the boundaries have been corrected. Around one&hyphen;third of the area is no longer listed because it was not considered to have the sorts of values that required it to be listed. Also, there has at last been some commitment to compensation. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8318"> A management plan has been developed. In fact, we even acknowledge in the report that what has happened over recent years could perhaps be a model for what could happen in other places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it has been over a decade too late. Sadly, reports of the experience of the Willandra Lakes have spread around the country and, naturally, have caused concern in other areas. In the future, when we have an area that we want to nominate, let us first talk about it with the community. We can then develop a management plan and also get the commitment to funding&mdash;this is a key element&mdash;the ongoing management and development of the area before the nomination is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, we have stored up all of these World Heritage areas but there has been a lack of commitment to fund them to make sure that the maintenance occurs and that the necessary visitor facilities are installed. It has to be said that the Commonwealth managed World Heritage areas such as Kakadu and Uluru have been less disadvantaged in relation to funding than other areas. I think the committee, during its deliberations, visited most of the World Heritage areas. Indeed, the committee has visited all of the World Heritage areas over recent years. The financial assistance that the Commonwealth has provided at Kakadu and Uluru is obvious to any visitor. There are excellent visitor facilities and the standard of management has reached a high level. Sadly, that is not the case in some of the World Heritage areas managed by the states. Queensland has more World Heritage areas than other states but its record is probably the poorest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fraser Island in my own electorate was nominated in an atmosphere of great controversy. The Commonwealth and state provided a $51 million compensation package which essentially arose from the parallel decision to stop logging on Fraser Island. But that $51 million package, negotiated between the Goss government and the federal government of the day, has largely disappeared into the sands. There is very little to show for it. Instead of securing the future of the region, as was intended when the package was announced, the money has dissipated into many worthless projects and into activities that have no lasting benefits. There is little to show for the expenditure of that money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, some of the projects funded were worthwhile, but they had little to do with securing the future of the region. Money was spent on constructing streets in Maryborough City, including one in front of my own office. Money was transferred into that project though work was completed before Fraser Island was even World Heritage listed. Money was spent on museums, church foundations, a home for the aged and buying rowing shells. They are all very worthwhile things but they had very little to do with the intention of the package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Money was spent on routine maintenance such as garbage collections. A big package of money was allocated towards a forest thinning project, and for maintenance work on Fraser Island and other places. That sort of work would normally be done as a part of the routine responsibilities of the state parks service and other government offices. What developed was a systematic siphoning of Commonwealth funds into the state coffers by guise of the package funding public servants to do work that they would have done anyhow. There was little lasting benefit to the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, in relation to Fraser Island, no effective community consultation process was put in place before or after the nomination. The local community was overwhelmingly opposed but no effort was ever made to win them over about the merits of World Heritage listing. An interim management committee was established which involved local government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8319"> leaders and others in the community. That committee has not met for around three years. The community consultation process has broken down. All of these things need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are similar difficulties with some of the other World Heritage areas where there has been a failure to adequately consult with the people of the region. We came across similar difficulties on Lord Howe Island. So it is not just in the state of Queensland that there are problems. It is obvious that, in many instances, the states have made inadequate efforts to involve the communities actively in ensuring that the World Heritage areas are presented effectively to the interested world community, and also to ensure that the World Heritage area is a good citizen, that it participates in the local community and that its management is commensurate with the wishes of the local community to achieve the objectives of their region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report contains some 54 recommendations&mdash;a plan for the future. It will require a commitment of more money and resources. I call on the federal government to make an early commitment to provide the financial resources to ensure that these recommendations can be implemented. We need to look after the precious areas that we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On occasions there will be a desire to nominate new areas for the list. I hope that the processes in the future will be better than we have had in the past. I thank everyone who has contributed to the report. I think it will play a very useful role in planning Australia's World Heritage management in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened this morning to the contribution of the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), the ALP spokesman on tourism. He devoted the whole of his speech to the environmental management charge on the Great Barrier Reef. In talking on a report such as this dealing with World Heritage areas, I would have thought that a tourism spokesman for the ALP would have mentioned the park at Uluru, Kakadu, the Tasmanian wilderness, the Wet Tropics in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8320"> Queensland, Fraser Island, Shark Bay, the Naracoorte fossil sites, the Riversleigh fossil sites, or the Willandra Lakes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the member for Cunningham did not mention them. He focused instead on the environmental management charge of th Great Barrier Reef. It is very interesting to read what the committee actually said about that charge. On page 183 of the report the committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that where it is feasible to collect fees, they should be more than a token amount. It supports the move in the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget to increase the environmental management fee by $5 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Who signed off on that report? The ALP members of that committee were the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), the former member for Fraser, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), who is the shadow environment minister, and last of all the member for Cunningham&mdash;the man who this morning spent 15 minutes talking about the environmental management charge. The member for Cunningham, the honourable S.P. Martin MP, signed off on this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that a shadow spokesman for tourism who signed off on a report like this would have at least read the report first. I know there was a minister in a previous government, Ros Kelly, who used to sign off on things such as environment packages before reading them. But I would have thought that before he signed off on this report the member for Cunningham would have read it. I remember someone on our own side&mdash;I think it was the member for Fadden, in 1991 or 1992&mdash;who signed a report that contradicted his own party's policy at that stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for the member for Cunningham to come in here this morning and devote the whole of his speech to the environmental management charge shows a disrespect for the important parliamentary work done in committees&mdash;I acknowledge that he did do some work in committees in the late 1980s and early 1990s relating to banking&mdash;and it shows a disregard for the other 10 World Heritage areas in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His concern with the environmental management charge shows a neglect of the very people who elected him. He came here as a representative of the people of Wollongong. What he is saying to them is that it is all right that they pay a lot of taxes through their own income; it is all right that they pay an incredible amount in wholesale sales tax; but it is unacceptable for the government to increase a charge on visitors to the Great Barrier Reef from $1 to $6.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he talks about a 500 per cent increase, admittedly that sounds horrific. But when you consider that it is an increase from $1 to $6&mdash;that is an increase roughly equivalent to the price of a hamburger&mdash;and the average price of a package to the Great Barrier Reef is something like $130, it puts the matter in perspective. If people actually make a decision to visit the Great Barrier Reef an increase of $5 is unlikely to make any difference to their decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In its submission to this committee, the Department of Finance actually regarded the $1 charge as being on the low side and more of a token charge. And there was feeling, even from the acting executive officer of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, that the market would probably bear something much higher than the $1 that is in place at the moment. Five dollars a day was mentioned as the possible charge, but increasing the charge was seen as presenting considerable difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at some of the other World Heritage areas&mdash;and Australia does have 11 of them; the member for Cunningham mentioned only one of them&mdash;during the course of the inquiry, the committee, of which I was a member, travelled to Kakadu and we found that Kakadu is, by and large, well funded and well managed. The key question while we were there revolved <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8321"> around whether Kakadu and also the park at Uluru should be managed by the Commonwealth or handed back to the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory argued that having the Commonwealth run Uluru and Kakadu&mdash;it is run by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency&mdash;was expensive, was an administrative duplication and was inconsistent with the constitutional development of the Northern Territory. There have been some votes in the last week which they might also see as being inconsistent with the constitutional development of the Northern Territory. The Tourism Council of Australia in its submission said that it would support handing the management of the World Heritage areas at Uluru and Kakadu in the Northern Territory back to the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The feeling of the committee was that a transfer could only be effected with the agreement of the traditional owners. The evidence that we gained was that, while on one hand the Gagadju, the board at Kakadu and the Anangu of Uluru opposed the transfer, on the other hand the Jawoyn Association, which has land both in Nitmiluk National Park and in Kakadu, said in a letter to the Prime Minister that they would like to be dealing with one body, presumably the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory. They had no objections to a transfer of the Jawoyn area of Kakadu back to the Parks and Wildlife Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was evident from our trip was that relations between ANCA and the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission had deteriorated. Our concern was that, without any cooperation, that deterioration would be evident in areas such as weed and feral animal control. Therefore, in two of our recommendations we felt that, before transfer back to the Northern Territory could be considered, the relationship between ANCA and the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory needed to be re&hyphen;established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We suggested a number of ways in which that could be done. It had been the practice in the past that through a mutual agreement the officers of the Northern Territory Conservation Commission, now the Parks and Wildlife Commission, had worked in Kakadu and Uluru. We suggested that they re&hyphen;introduce that practice and have some of the Northern Territory officers working in the park. We also suggested that the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission should be involved as observers at board meetings, in order to re&hyphen;establish the relationship between ANCA and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, as I said, 11 Australian sites listed as World Heritage areas, owing to their universal natural and/or cultural significance. As a signatory to UNESCO's convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage, the Commonwealth is responsible for the conservation, preservation and presentation to the public of these sites. Most sites are managed by the states, with Commonwealth oversight, the exceptions being Uluru and Kakadu, which I have just mentioned. As we would all be aware, the Commonwealth can use the external affairs power to intervene if the states fail to protect the values of those World Heritage areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such intervention has characterised some of the environmental battles of the past 20 years, revolving around the differing responsibilities and roles that the Commonwealth and states have had. The examples of the banning of sandmining on Fraser Island&mdash;which, I might add, occurred before Fraser Island was listed as a World Heritage site&mdash;and the prevention of the building of the dam in the Tasmanian wilderness, a prevention which relied on the Tasmanian wilderness being a World Heritage area, highlight Commonwealth government intervention in the area of the environment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8322">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of funding, the committee felt that Kakadu and Uluru&hyphen;Kata Tjuta were well funded by the Commonwealth, but that in areas managed by the states, with some top&hyphen;up funding from the Commonwealth, there should be two principles which established the level of funding. The first was that the state government should fund the areas to the level that they were funded at prior to being listed as World Heritage areas, and that the Commonwealth should provide top&hyphen;up funding to raise the standard and also to preserve and present the values that allowed the areas to be listed as World Heritage areas. The second was that agreement&mdash;which, as the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) has highlighted, has not always been there&mdash;should be reached between the state governments and the Commonwealth on the amount of funding that each should contribute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state of South Australia we have only one World Heritage site and that is the fossil site at the Naracoorte Caves Conservation Park. When the previous chairman, the former member for Fraser visited the caves, he considered that they were well run and that they were managing quite well with limited funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, as the member for Wide Bay has already mentioned, Fraser Island and the Riversleigh fossil site were identified as two World Heritage areas which lacked adequate funding and had problems in terms of information sites, the way the values were presented to the public and the way in which they were highlighted as World Heritage sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All World Heritage areas should consider the need for cost recovery measures to supplement government funding. It is important to establish the principles which should dictate how user fees should operate. And that was dealt with in recommendation 53. In that, we asked the department to review user fees in the World Heritage areas, and to establish how user fees should be administered and set.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, at the outset I put on the record my commendation of the chairman and the committee for the conduct of this inquiry. It is traditional to have that kind of backslapping, but I mean that very genuinely. The committee visited the central areas where this is important&mdash;Port Lincoln, Perth and Hobart&mdash;and where there are very substantial localised issues. The overall conduct of the inquiry was, indeed, commendable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These agreements are interrelated with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the agreement on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thrust of the committee's concerns was that in the area of by&hyphen;catch there was a fear that current abatement processes might drag on to the point where that might act as a factor in delaying action. We have the current investigation of that. Obviously, there were concerns about the rights of those people who indulge in fishing as a hobby. They were the thrust of the concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreements are argued for on the basis of our negotiating leverage with the Japanese; the access fee that we receive; the protection of the southern bluefin tuna stocks; species monitoring; the funding of research; and, as was indicated by the earlier comment, the meeting of international treaty requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I am not as convinced as others about the `high access fee'. It is very questionable that we actually know the value of this produce on the Japanese market. I have seen estimates of $94 million. We tend to be too inclined to look at a comparison of ourselves with countries that are not really in a very strong negotiating position. We only have to look at the events in Vanuatu over the last month or so to see some of the infrastructure that is lacking in those countries affecting their ability to deal with major powers. The Solomon Islands is another instance. I appreciate that South Africa was one comparison made to the committee and maybe they could say we are in a reasonable position in what we have accomplished compared to South Africa. But with the dislocation there in the last few years I do not know how strong their bureaucracy is in its ability to deal with these kinds of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think the committee has to keep under review whether we are getting a reasonable deal out of this. At the same time, we do have to be careful in dealing with the Japanese that we do not force them out of the system and thereby endanger the species by their non&hyphen;involvement. The committee dealt with the threat of non&hyphen;involvement of Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and others. That is a matter that the government has to keep under serious review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing that did concern me&mdash;and this is probably a personal view and did not concern other members of the committee&mdash;was that the Australian tuna boat owners have a very close connection with the Japanese market. Although I can understand their personal requirements and commercial interests, I did have a fear that their very positive attitude towards the Japanese involvement was perhaps affected to some degree by that interrelationship. We have to be very careful when people have these commercial tie&hyphen;ups that, whilst they might perceive themselves as arguing from the basis of Australia's national requirements, perhaps their position is constrained by those realities. In the long term I see a need for us to be vigilant when they argue that we have gained the technology or the knowledge. As I say, they are very closely entwined with the Japanese market and that is a factor in how we review this industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8324">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to the thrust of the inquiry, we have advocated more training for the observers to increase their knowledge of seabird research, the collection of data on seabird by&hyphen;catch and the effectiveness of by&hyphen;catch mitigation measures. While the committee could not arrive at an unquestioned determination, there have been claims that although there seemed to be a reasonable presence of observers there have been instances where there was a correlation between the observers' presence and the reports of by&hyphen;catch or other concerns in the field. The thrust of the inquiry was around the question of seabird by&hyphen;catch and I want to commend the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) on this issue. If any member of the committee really did focus on this issue throughout, it was him and the committee's report owes something to his determination to put that issue forward, particularly on the question of the albatross.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must be concerned that since the 1952 arrival of the Japanese in the long&hyphen;line industry there seems to be an increasing danger to the albatross and related species. It was interesting to read the information about the albatross that came to the attention of the committee. Its survival is very much a hairline exercise, not just because of by&hyphen;catch but throughout history. Albatrosses take 11 years to start breeding and they only produce one egg every second year. Those are all factors, as well as the fact that the female does tend to forage in areas where long&hyphen;line fishing is prevalent. They are also not all one species and those from different islands, such as the Antipodes, Auckland, Tristan da Cunha, are very much endangered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting the comments of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nature Australia </EMPHASIS>in the winter of 1995. Their claim is that 50,000 had been killed in Australian and New Zealand waters, and I think this puts the issue where it is at:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an expanding world population demands more from the ocean's resources, the task of protecting vulnerable species will not become easier. Our inadequate knowledge of albatross populations, their greater dependence on resources in international waters and their insignificant economic value result in complex political issues and no funds for research. Raising the funds to apply this technology is an urgent task as a diminishing population increases the difficulty of acquisition of knowledge essential for their survival.</PARA>
<PARA>So, when we take into consideration the fact that they do take 11 years to breed, every second year, that they basically need a 32 to 33 per cent survival rate to sustain themselves and the average one has to reach 30 years before it essentially replaces itself, there are concerns. I am pleased to say that the committee's emphasis is on measures that put this in the forefront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, with the by&hyphen;catch of other fish species there is a very strong emphasis by this committee not that we seek to minimise the numbers but that we actually are proactive in trying to eliminate it as much as possible. Of course, the report goes into various alternatives: night setting, where there are indications of a 70 to 96 per cent reduction; the question of bait throwing gear, which is already, as I understand it, used on over 100 Japanese boats; the investigation in New Zealand and Norway of setting lines under water by a hydraulic ram to send the bait down; and forward baits. All of these things should be followed through very strongly, and I think it is fair to say that the committee is very supportive of activities in those fields.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the committee has given approval to the treaty. It emphasises throughout the need for greater information. It does express concern because of the circumvention of Australian ownership of vessels; it does extend the boundaries on the Tasmanian coast. But overall it does express a concern that we must put the conservation measures to the fore.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I thank the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) both for his comments this morning and for his contribution to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8325"> committee. Both have been substantial. I will come back at the end of my contribution this morning to say a little bit more conceptually about this committee and what it is about in this parliament. But let me start off by saying that this particular report, which is the third report of four that have been tabled since the committee was set up as a result of our government's initiative in May, is a little different from the other three. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss, as a member of the committee, three of the four that have been tabled have dealt with specific treaties that have been tabled under the so&hyphen;called 15&hyphen;day rule. This is slightly different in that it is an issue that was thought by the committee to be appropriate to test the waters, in many ways, to see what a specific bilateral agreement was all about and to see the level to which the community and government organisations wanted to become involved. As a result of all that, quite apart from the magnitude and the size of the report and the issues that it covers, I think it reinforces the wisdom of what we are doing as a parliament in terms of the treaty making processes and the reforms thereto.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an important report in that it deals specifically with a bilateral agreement between Japan and Australia in terms of southern bluefin tuna. The committee also took the opportunity, about two&hyphen;thirds of the way through the couple of months of inquiry, to pick up the suggestions from the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. These issues are embodied in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important report at ministerial level for a number of ministers, and not simply because of its size&mdash;the report was prepared in very short order&mdash;and the issues that it raises. At the global level, it is important for the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), in terms of the treaty&hyphen;making process, and for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), in terms of resource implications. It is also important for Senator Parer, in his responsibility as resources minister, and specifically the fishing industry. It is an important report for the state governments that were very heavily involved in our inquiries on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to some of the peak bodies and the non&hyphen;government organisations, notably, the Tuna Boat Owners Association of Australia. We hope it will be a valuable tool to enhance and improve what is already a very healthy situation in that industry. Hopefully, as a result of this report, and if ministers and government agree, some of the initiatives reflected in the recommendations will be helpful in enhancing the diplomatic and commercial relationships with our important partner&mdash;that is, Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) indicated, the report gets into wider issues than the treaties committee intended with this particular one. I think the report will be an important tool for the house committee which, as I understand it, is dealing with the more global issue of fishing resources and the fishing industry. I know that the secretariat of that committee is looking at it and we hope it will assist them in resolving some of the issues and, inevitably, some of the problems within that particular industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this report is different from the other three that have been tabled in the House, the last, of course, on Monday of last week. The report deals specifically with the subsidiary agreement between Japan and Australia on long&hyphen;line tuna fishing. It also makes some valuable comments and recommendations in relation to the agreement on the establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. I am delighted that Senator Parer has announced&mdash;I think in the last week&mdash;that Australia is to become party to that commission. This highlights the fact that government can react to some of the recommendations that this committee has made in very short order and we welcome that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8326">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will read into the record a number of the benefits of the subsidiary agreement between Japan and Australia because I think they are very important. I will then very briefly highlight one or two of the recommendations. The report makes the point that the benefits of the agreement to Australia include: a high access fee by international standards&mdash;the honourable member for Reid questioned whether it is high in relative terms but, in general terms, the feeling is that the access fee is high&mdash;no damage to Australian fisheries as Japan uses its own quota of southern bluefin tuna and highly migratory species such as yellowfin or bigeye, ensuring that southern bluefin tuna stocks are not further reduced; monitoring of species stocks that would otherwise not be possible, or would be difficult and expensive; and access to the Japanese fleet to influence their seabird avoidance practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report talks about economic benefits. Those economic benefits, of course, are very substantial whether you look at the direct benefits or the multiplier effect. There is some argument as to what the multiplier effect is. It varies between about two and five but if you look at the direct economic impact in a port like Fremantle, for example, and apply a multiplier, it does have arguably an economic plus of about $70 million to $80 million to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It provides the Australian government with some leverage in other negotiations within the commission on southern bluefin tuna. It provides us with access to Japanese data on fishing locations which is very important. It provides access to Japanese data on shared stocks outside the Australian fishing zone. It enables the collection of biological samples. It, in fact, provides direct funding for research on tuna and billfish. It should be pointed out that the Japanese contribution to that is substantial and without this bilateral agreement that would not happen. Of course, as the honourable member for Reid highlighted, it is part of meeting Australia's commitments under the umbrella United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also make mention in the report of the disadvantages to Australia of not concluding the agreement. We hope that there is no consideration given to not concluding the agreement but we have reinforced our view by making the points that the disadvantages would be substantial and could include the potential environmental and financial losses. I forgot to mention that among the ministers who are involved here, an important minister who has more than a casual interest in what this report says is the Minister for the Environment. There is a very large element in this report in terms of by&hyphen;catch and mitigation measures et cetera that we hope the government will pick up and implement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We point out the financial loss as a result of the loss of the access fee; the fisheries relationship with Japan in diplomatic and commercial terms; and the regular forum of communication with Japan albeit that that is always difficult. Japanese are hard negotiators as the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) would know and I hope he will say something about this in due course. I will say a bit more about the benefits from port access arrangements in a moment. As far as accurate and timely information on technological developments are concerned, the Japanese have been very influential with Australian tuna fishermen in transferring some of that technology. I suggest that this would not have happened without this particular bilateral agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's influence over Japanese fishing operations in relation to by&hyphen;catch has already been mentioned. Funds for management and research would need to be sourced from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8327"> Australian industry or would not be available. That is reinforced in the report. We obtain overall valuable information in terms of the fishery and fishery stocks within our fishing zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time left to me, I will make mention of three issues.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OJ4">Mr TAYLOR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will have your chance, Mr Price. There are three specific recommendations I would just like to highlight. One is in terms of the periodicity of the bilateral agreement. It has been one year. We are recommending at least two years for a number of reasons that I do not have time to go into. We think it is very desirable that the duration of that bilateral report is extended and I understand that Senator Parer, for example, is reasonably disposed towards that but it has to go through the bureaucratic processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second recommendation I would highlight is the one in relation to Tasmania and the 50 nautical mile recommendation for southern bluefin tuna. At the moment Tasmania is restricted to a 15 nautical mile limit. We, on balance, felt the limit should be consistent right across the country, and we recommend that Tasmania extend its exclusion zone to 50 nautical miles. We commend that recommendation to ministers and to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other recommendation I would like to highlight concerns port access and the separation of port access and quota. It took up a lot of our time in inquiries and in consideration in committee. We have come down very strongly on this view, which I would like to read into the record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends the separation of port access from the subsidiary agreement but&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>with this caveat&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">making port access subject to the continuation of Japan's membership of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and participation in the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an important caveat, which we hope will enable the negotiations to continue and to enhance what are already reasonable arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by reiterating what the honourable member for Reid said about countries outside the bluefin tuna commission. There are some other important nations that fish on the high seas&mdash;namely, Indonesia, Taiwan and Korea&mdash;and the People's Republic of China is becoming an increasing player in this area as well. We hope that this agreement can, in due course, bring those countries in under the umbrella of the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, my final point is in relation to the reforms that were announced earlier this year and embodied in the formation of this committee. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) said in the House in question time yesterday, what this government is about is consultation with, and accountability to, the Australian people. That is what the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is all about. I regret to say, to be party political for a moment, that is what the other side did not do in government. We are out to reverse those perceptions and&mdash;</PARA>

It is a strong team. The members include the honourable member for Reid and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). I could not let the opportunity go by without making a particular point about the deputy chair, the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland), who has provided <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8328"> very strong support to me as chair, and also specifically about the secretariat&mdash;Peter Stephens and, for this particular report, Cheryl Scarlett.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is not often that I get the opportunity to have the drop on the chairman of a committee&mdash;in this case, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who has just completed his contribution. I want to take up the last point that he made. In the last parliament I well recall the current Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) talking about their proposal for a treaties committee. I believe that, in this place, the best defence is always truth and honesty. I have to say that not only did I have some reservations about the proposal but, at best, I was indifferent to it and probably a little sceptical about it. I certainly felt that having a committee that dealt with nothing but treaties was perhaps not the best approach and that utilising the existing committee structure was probably a better approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that members on both sides&mdash;to be fair&mdash;in the last parliament were unhappy about the inadequate addressing of treaties. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has, in my view, proven itself, notwithstanding the shameless dorothy dixer asked by the honourable member for Groom yesterday. It has worked, and the fact that it encompasses a wide range of different subjects does not in any way seem to be impeding its good work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For anything that adds to this parliament, I am always grateful, and I think that the treaties committee is doing that. I note, for example, in the report that we are talking about, that 45 submissions does not break the record, but it is 45 more than we would have received in the old parliament. The great virtue of the committee system is that, when a committee is run well, it opens the parliament up to the people. Just when we are facing the new millennium or the 100th year of federation, members of both houses need to be conscious that we are extending opportunities for ordinary citizens, in particular, to access the parliament, to be in touch with parliament and understand what it is doing. I congratulate the honourable member for Groom. I congratulate all of the committee members&mdash;I think they are doing a very good job. I am not a member of this particular committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the subject matter of the report, I also acknowledge the role of John Langmore, who was the chairman of the environment committee. As you know, he has retired. John has many virtues which were not always recognised in this place. One has been a commitment to the environment, particularly in his role as chairman of the environment committee. I have noticed, since I have been a member, that more and more people in the cities are becoming more and more concerned about environmental issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fisheries is a particularly sensitive issue. As citizens of this world&mdash;I know that is a term some people do not like using, but we are all citizens of Australia and also citizens of this world&mdash;we have witnessed the extinction of some fishing stocks, where they have been absolutely fished out. In America, there have been the sardines and in Europe, the cod. There is quite a list of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot treat fisheries or what is in our ocean as an inexhaustible supply. We have to be conscious that we owe it to future generations to preserve what we already have so that we do not lose any more species, and to ensure that species are not over&hyphen;fished. This becomes very difficult when some countries, in terms of diet, are heavily reliant on fish and think that they have almost a unilateral right to fish to meet that demand.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8329">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is, I guess, my general position. I also wanted to say, in terms of Australia and the environment, that I notice that school children these days are far better environmentalists than my generation ever was. There are probably a number of explanations for that: the impact of TV, of communications. In particular&mdash;and again, this is probably not fashionable&mdash;I would compliment the teachers in schools for the sense of awareness they are creating in a generation of younger Australians about the environment. I commend them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairman of the committee really left me very little say. I think he ran through every recommendation and every conclusion in the report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very thorough, and I note he was going to finish his speaking time on a number of occasions. I am particularly interested in the issue of by&hyphen;catch in the report and I want to commend the committee. I note that there are a number of recommendations dealing with the principal by&hyphen;catch which is birds&mdash;albatross and some other species. I will not run through the list. I think by&hyphen;catch, in all aspects of fishing, is a particularly important and serious problem. We do need to develop either techniques of fishing or management that eliminate by&hyphen;catch problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case, of course, I am talking about the bird life, but in other cases it can refer to other species of fish that are just thrown out. And whilst we have undertaken a deal of research into those catches that have an economic value and are much sought after, unfortunately there is not a lot of research done on those species that form part of the by&hyphen;catch problem.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased again to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate today, this time in the Main Committee, on the question of civil aviation safety in Australia. The discussion today relates to the report that was done by Commissioner Staunton into relations between the Civil Aviation Authority, as it then was, and Seaview Air.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in the House previously on this matter, this report makes very disturbing reading. When you actually go through the detail in the report you can see that not only is there a very strong pattern of deliberate flouting of civil aviation regulations by the operator on a very wide range of issues, there is also an equally strong pattern of the regulator, in effect, conniving in this flouting of regulations&mdash;ignoring it and allowing the operator to continue flouting the regulations. Ultimately, this was in gross dereliction of its duty as a regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Responsibility for this has been sheeted home to a couple of key officials within CASA who, thankfully, as a result of the findings of Commissioner Staunton's report, have since paid the consequences. Nonetheless, it does give a very disturbing picture of the situation within the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8330"> then Civil Aviation Authority and it fits very well with a similar picture that was presented by Mr Peter Gould, the Coroner, in his inquiry into the Monarch crash, which was only a month distant from the Seaview crash. Both occurred in a very dark period for aviation safety in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the issues that are dealt with in the Seaview report include: the operation of a regular passenger transport service without authorisation&mdash;Seaview was only supposed to be a charter operator but it was de facto operating as an RPT service; regular overloading of the planes; regular siting of unrestrained cargo inside planes; a variety of defects in maintenance with respect to instrumentation and equipment; and, for a period of time, flying without an appropriate maintenance release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see in the Seaview report is a picture of an operator, Mr Green, who clearly had an absolute disregard for the basic safety and security of his customers; who was concerned to make money and was quite happy to cut corners in order to pursue profit; who was quite happy to put extreme pressure on his pilots in order to ensure that they complied with his wishes rather than their obligations to the passengers, their professional obligations as pilots, and their obligations to the public in accordance with the civil aviation safety regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Green does not emerge very well from this report and I share the concern of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to ensure that Mr Green no longer conducts any form of passenger transport service in the aviation industry, given the attitude that he has demonstrated and given his subsequent behaviour and apparent lack of contrition as a result of the findings of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of equal concern emerging from the report was the finding that the relevant Civil Aviation Authority officer at the time, Mr Paul, had virtually deliberately failed to carry out his duties to properly surveil the Seaview operation. On numerous occasions he was presented with clear evidence of breaches of regulations and other serious breaches&mdash;not trivial breaches, not technical breaches, but serious breaches&mdash;and on each occasion he seemed to bend over backwards almost deliberately to avoid taking any action. He took the word of the operator and failed to follow through on investigations. Clearly, he was biased in favour of the operator and was doing everything he could to ensure that the Civil Aviation Authority did not impede Seaview's capacity to operate in spite of the very clear evidence that serious deficiencies in the Seaview operation were apparent and that any reasonable regulator would have addressed those deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of similar concern is the behaviour of his superior, Mr Bryant, who failed to properly manage and to supervise his subordinate and clearly was complicit in the failure of regulatory enforcement that was involved. The failures of both of these officers are highlighted by the fact that there was, indeed, a conscientious officer, a whistleblower, within the CAA, Mr Hoy, who, as a result of his efforts to try to get some action with respect to Seaview, found that the one substantive response was that his ability to do his job was restricted, that certain limitations were imposed on him within the authority which previously were not there, and that his efforts to conscientiously do his job and to conscientiously look after the interests of passengers in aviation transport were met with not only obstruction but also outright penalties and restrictions on his work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that is worth observing as a result of this report is that like the report that was done by the Coroner Peter Gould into the Monarch inquiry, there is a clear conclusion that the origins of these problems lie ultimately in the regime within the Civil Aviation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8331"> Authority in the early 1990s which imposed a perspective known as `affordable safety'. This led to a very drastic reduction in the number of regulatory staff within the authority&mdash;under the so&hyphen;called review of resources&mdash;and which led to a situation where the industry was deemed to be the customer of the authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Justice Fisher, the Chair of the Civil Aviation Authority said pertinently that it is long overdue that we parliamentarians, the minister, and people in the authority, realise that the authority is not there to serve the industry; it is there to serve the Australian people. It is there to regulate the industry. It is the policeman of the industry. It is there to serve the Australian public and, in particular, the 30 million passengers that are carried in aviation transport every year. That is whom the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is there to serve, not the industry itself. And that ideology which permeated the organisation in the early 1990s has had disastrous consequences and these can be seen in the Seaview and the Monarch reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been fortunate earlier this morning to be part of a briefing for the House committee that was conducted by the CEO of CASA, Mr Leroy Keith, and a couple of senior officials. That briefing was designed to inform us in some detail as to the steps that CASA is taking bit by bit to bring itself up to scratch, to eradicate the problems that have clearly contributed to the disasters&mdash;one of which we are dealing with today. There is an increase in staff, not only administrative staff, which is necessary because of the separation from Air Services, but also regulatory staff both on the flying operations and airworthiness sides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also provision for better training of regulators, and more standardised procedures to ensure that any particular operator is going to get approximately the same treatment, the same line and the same approach with respect to the enforcement of regulations, no matter what part of the country the operator is in. We have heard of the regulatory review that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development has introduced, and that I applaud. Although the content of the regulations is not the key problem&mdash;the key problem has been the enforcement of those regulations&mdash;clearly it is appropriate that the regulations be reviewed and brought into line with international numbering and with international standards with respect to precision, lack of ambiguity and the like. So that review is an equally important part of the overall strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CASA is also planning to increase its activities with respect to oversight of international operations in our region, and to ensure that any plane coming in to Australia is subject to an equivalent regime of surveillance in the country of origin. We have planes flying to Australia from a variety of countries and often from very small and poor countries. In some cases, there are questions about the extent to which those planes are surveilled within those countries. CASA is going to step up its operations on that front, a move which I applaud. Another thing that is very clear and that I also applaud is that CASA is fully aware that its obligations are to serve the people of Australia and not to serve the industry, and that CASA is there to regulate the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has had, in the eight or nine months he has been in the ministry, a rather peculiar track record on the issue of aviation safety. We have seen him overrule his own safety regulators with respect to electronic locater transmitters and impose on the Australian people an alternative standard&mdash;and we are the only serious civil aviation safety regulator in the world to permit this&mdash;which Mr Keith, the head of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, has acknowledged is a lesser standard of safety. And the minister has directly intervened to bring this about.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8332">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen the minister deliberately try to blacken the name of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in order to pursue his very peculiar vendetta against the board of the authority. Mr Keith again made it plain that the board and the minister both support the strategy that CASA management is pursuing to improve performance and to eradicate the problems of the past. In spite of this, the minister is pursuing an extremely peculiar vendetta against both the chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Mr Justice Fisher, and other board members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, we have seen the situation where, in the case of the recent Falcon Airlines crash, the minister&mdash;in seeking to blacken CASA by pointing out that the former owner of Falcon Airlines was now a CASA officer in the same region and by suggesting that there was a conflict of interest issue involved&mdash;deliberately failed to point out that, as a condition of his new employment, the person involved, a Mr Killen, was obliged to engage in no regulatory activities and no supervisory activities in respect of his former airline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though there clearly is a question to be considered with respect to the appropriateness of the appointment&mdash;let us face it, the source of potentially half of CASA regulatory employees is going to be the aviation industry, because that is where the expertise to regulate civil aviation is going to come from; and so there are always going to be problems of this sort&mdash;it is also abundantly clear that there can be no connection between Mr Killen's appointment and any question mark that may exist with respect to CASA's supervision of Falcon Airlines, because he was specifically excluded from being involved in that supervision. But did the minister mention this at any point? No, he did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same vein, Dr Robert Liddell resigned from the authority as Chief Medical Officer some weeks ago, in a burst of publicity and with a range of accusations. It emerged, following that resignation, that the real reasons he was resigning were that the authority was now refusing to pay the cost of his being trained to fly 767s and that his international travel budget had been reduced&mdash;neither of which, I would have thought, were particularly deleterious decisions with respect to the core issues of aviation safety. Minister Sharp has failed to come out and acknowledge that, in this instance, CASA was not in any way in the wrong, and that Dr Liddell had made his decision to resign but that his accusations against CASA were quite clearly ill founded. Has the minister actually acknowledged this in public? Not once. He is engaged in a vendetta against CASA and particularly against the board, for reasons which are very difficult to explain.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YU5">Mr TANNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, they do not. The board have only been in office since mid&hyphen;1995, well after this disaster occurred and well after the Monarch disaster occurred. It is abundantly clear that they are both actively involved and supportive of the position that is being adopted by the CASA management. As far as I am concerned, if he does not have confidence in the CASA board then he equally does not have confidence in the CASA director, Mr Keith, in whom, as I have said in the parliament previously, I certainly have confidence. That confidence has been renewed by the discussion we have had today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has got to start facing up to some facts. Not only is he failing to contribute to the process of renewal and improvement of our aviation safety regulation process which has deteriorated in the early 1990s, as this report indicates, but also, in effect, he is positively undermining it by constantly attacking the organisation which is charged with that responsibility by undermining the morale of the staff who work in that organisation, by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8333"> attacks on the board and by the implied attacks on the CEO, Mr Keith. It is high time that he grasped his responsibilities, which are to the 30 million passengers out there who fly, not to small sectional interests in the industry with whom he is very closely associated. They are the people whom we must serve with respect to aviation safety in this country. They are the people whom we have to look after and ensure that they are protected. That is CASA's task. It is not to serve the industry; it is to regulate the industry. It is high time that the minister got behind the authority and the changes that are being made, instead of attacking and undermining it. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 October 1994, nine people died in a plane on their way to a holiday. No doubt their expectations were high as they looked forward to their holiday break on Lord Howe Island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leeca and Anthony Atkinson were starting off on their honeymoon and their new life together. Reg and Pam Drayton were taking a second honeymoon. Parents Stephen and Carol Lake and Judith and Benhamin, two of their children, were excitedly starting off on a family holiday. The young pilot, Paul Sheil, is also a victim of the accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission of inquiry into the relations between the Civil Aviation Authority, as it then was, and Seaview Air is one of the most disturbing and slamming reports we could have the unhappy obligation to read and take note of. Commissioner Staunton's report is a damning indictment of the CAA and all of its operating processes. In July 1994, the CAA conferred the status of an airline&mdash;a regular public transport operator&mdash;on Seaview Air. Just 10 weeks later, its flagship, VH&hyphen;SVQ, crashed while flying from Williamtown to Lord Howe Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report reveals how an unsafe organisation, Seaview Air, could have the status of regular public transport operator conferred on it and could continue to operate, despite knowledge of lack of safety both within its own organisation and within the so-called regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, and despite repeated warnings. This report reveals the incompetence of a regulator too shy and toothless to implement the most rudimentary safety standards. This report reveals the slipshod and uncaring attitude of a greedy operator which threw caution to the wind without considering the consequences of putting lives at very real risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nine people who died when that Seaview plane crashed in 1994 would not have known that they were risking their lives by getting on that plane. They would not have known, as did others in the industry and in the CAA, that the airline was essentially unsafe. So widespread was the knowledge of the lack of safety of this airline that when he was a shadow minister, the now Minister for Transport, John Sharp, made warnings in the House about this specific airline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 4 May 1994, in the House of Representatives, Minister Sharp, as he is now, when speaking about Seaview's operations, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this airline which was operating so dangerously and which was putting people's lives at risk continued to fly.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister has subsequently said that it gives him no satisfaction that those concerns were most sadly proven correct by the Seaview crash in October that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms of reference for this inquiry were to inquire into the operation of the CAA in connection with: firstly, the appropriateness of decisions and administrative actions of officers of the authority relating to the operations of Seaview Air during 1994&mdash;and earlier if necessary&mdash;including its upgrading to a regular public transport operator; secondly, the diligence and propriety with which officers of the authority and Seaview Air discharged their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8334"> respective responsibilities relating to the safety of Seaview Air operations and, thirdly, the effectiveness of the management systems within the Civil Aviation Authority and communication between its various levels as they related to Seaview Air. The terms of reference were to include also an examination of the implications of any findings including the measures necessary to ensure total propriety in air safety and administration, or the most appropriate and effective method for the government to consider those findings for the purpose of determining the measures necessary to ensure total propriety in air safety administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report's 39 recommendations are well considered and insightful. They are the result of the contribution of 142 witnesses, over 900 exhibits, 224 days of sitting, and almost 17,000 pages of transcript. They are, given the most essential standards of air safety, absolute commonsense. In this two&hyphen;volume report, Commissioner Staunton has noted a number of serious issues which require further attention and almost immediate action. Included amongst these are: firstly, an attitude that characterises breaches of the Civil Aviation Act, regulations and the orders&mdash;the attitude is called `aviation trivia'; secondly, a practice of cross hiring that enables an operator to use an aircraft of a type not endorsed on the AOC; thirdly, what can at times be considered widespread disregard by general aviation maintenance organisations for the manufacturers' requirements; fourthly, a practice of pilots overstating flying hours to obtain employment with larger operators; fifthly, the standards and adequacy of pilot training; sixthly, allowing new or relatively inexperienced pilots to fly alone and with passengers with very close to the minimum required flying hours for that particular aircraft type; seventhly, and again, the inadequacy of the maintenance release system; and, eighthly, the importance of the regulatory authority to have adequate information about operators and pilots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since earlier this year I have chaired the Sydney aircraft community forum which was established by the new coalition government and is charged with the responsibility of consulting with communities in Sydney affected by aircraft noise and other environmental matters concerned with the operations, primarily, of Sydney (Kingsford&hyphen;Smith) Airport. For all of us on the committee, safety is paramount to our consideration of the operations of the airport and the delicate balance of ensuring, as a responsible government, that Australia's most significant airport operates effectively, while minimising the inconvenience and environmental implications for Sydney's large number of residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the chairman of the Sydney airport community forum, with its geographically&mdash;and I would like to point out&mdash;politically diverse membership, and our close relationship with Sydney's residents on this issue, I baulk at the thought that the slipshod and careless attitude which led to the Seaview crash off Lord Howe Island in 1994 could in any way occur in or out of Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of all the concerns that have been expressed by Commissioner Staunton in this report, the underlying question has to be: was the Civil Aviation Authority competent in its activities and considerations in the lead&hyphen;up to the very tragic Seaview aircraft crash? It is absolutely crucial that the now safety regulator, CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which was hived off out of part of the body of the Civil Aviation Authority, has as its key consideration the safety of fee paying passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Civil Aviation Safety Authority provided a briefing to the Sydney Airport community forum on their day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operations, they were unequivocal about their commitment primarily, and almost only, to the safety of fee paying passengers in commercial aircraft. That is absolutely totally appropriate. One of the concerns of the Sydney Airport <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8335"> community forum was&mdash;and I think it was a fair concern&mdash;that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority does not take into account the safety of some of the passengers that live their daily lives underneath the most busy flight paths in the Sydney basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The joint responsibility for safety is not just with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It extends to Airservices Australia and the Federal Airports Corporation and the guiding hand has to come from the Department of Transport. But the dangers are lived by the people of Sydney every day. In fact, the commuters of Australia are living daily with the possible threat of a major aviation disaster. It gives no comfort at all to the people of Sydney that the Civil Aviation Authority, as it once was, has been found, by Commissioner Staunton, to have some of the most irregular and unsophisticated work practices of any safety authority in Australia. Imagine if the 20.5 million passengers who flew in and out of Sydney Airport last year were subject to the same risk as those nine unfortunate people flying on board Seaview to Lord Howe Island were. Imagine if the 269,000 aircraft movements to and from Sydney Airport last year had the odds stacked up against them in the same way that the Seaview plane had the odds stacked up against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thankfully, there are some redeeming factors. The commercial airlines that operate out of Sydney airport have higher standards than Seaview Air. This report reveals all too fully the fact that Seaview Air was a shoddy organisation. It was run for the most base principles of making money, getting the planes up in the air and getting the passengers out. There was total disregard for some of the most basic elements of civil aviation safety. For example, there was a failure to comply with the basic requirements of regular passenger transport. There were extensive defects on the planes and maintenance was regarded as poor. Also, one of the most obvious requirements of air safety&mdash;flying with the proper maintenance release&mdash;was often not complied with. Often the planes were overloaded as they were flying off to Lord Howe Island&mdash;sometimes up to 130 kilograms overloaded. That is one of the concerns, I might add, of the Sydney Airport community forum&mdash;that the courier planes and the transport planes that are departing and arriving into Sydney Airport during the curfew hours may not be complying with the load requirements for the airport and for the individual planes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also strong evidence of excessive work hours for pilots. Sometimes the pilots would understate the number of hours in their trip. In fact, in the report, there is one incident where the Civil Aviation Authority safety officer was in the cockpit with the pilot of the plane flying to Lord Howe Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I remember my figures correctly, the flight was a six&hyphen;hour flight. But the pilot recorded 4&half; hours and he had the Civil Aviation Authority safety officer in the cockpit next to him during the flight. So, where it suited them, there was an excessive recording of work hours for pilots to get their flying hours up and, on the other hand, they understated the flying hours. It does indicate there is a deeper problem in the aviation industry with some of the smaller operators and with what pilots will do to keep their jobs, which are very hard to find in commercial enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people leave school, go and spend a lot of money, raise a lot of money to learn how to fly, and then they are desperate to get their flying hours up and the only way they can do that is with a commercial operator. It was shown that when Seaview Air was operating at an earlier date, the owner of the airline was particularly harsh on the younger pilots, making sure that they worked longer hours and did not receive the proper awards.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has given me some level of comfort out of his briefing with CASA this morning. He said that there will be an increase in the number of staff, particularly in relation to regulation. He said that there will be better training for regulators and that there is an increased oversight of international airlines, which is a major problem at the moment. So there is some comforting factor but there is still some way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this report, Commissioner Staunton said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public safety demands high standards of diligence and integrity by both the regulator and the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>There is an obligation to ensure that the regulator is not institutionally timid, as was the criticism of the CAA with regard to Seaview. The regulator is there to protect the passengers. The nine people who died off Lord Howe Island deserved better than what they received. Air passengers, in trusting their lives to airline operators in every plane flying in and out of Australian skies, deserve better than that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
