<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> welcomes the initiative of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to launch a National Reconciliation Week to be held each year from 27 May to 3 June for at least the next five years up to 2001, the centenary of Federation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> notes that the inaugural National Reconciliation Week beginning on 27 May 1996 will launch twelve months of community activities and a public awareness campaign leading up to the Australian Reconciliation Convention, which will be held during National Reconciliation Week in 1997;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reaffirms its commitment to a process of reconciliation; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> calls on all Australians to support the National Reconciliation Week and thereby to advance the reconciliation process.</PARA>
<PARA>As I am sure we are all aware as we meet in the chamber now, in the Great Hall of this parliament there are a large number of people assembled at a reconciliation lunch hosted by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot). Amongst those at that lunch today, 27 May, which marks the anniversary of the 1967 referendum&mdash;and also, at the end of the week, 3 June marks the anniversary of the Mabo decision which is so important to indigenous people in this country&mdash;are a great number of people who have prominence and interest in these affairs of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Present, for example, are the first indigenous member of the federal parliament, Senator Neville Bonner, and Mrs Mabo. There are a number of activists from that campaign all those years ago in 1967. All of them have come here today to support the process of reconciliation in our country between the indigenous Aboriginal and the Torres Strait Islander people and the wider community. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Those people there and the dates that we are signifying today are part of the living history that is represented in our community, and it is a living history that marks specifically a turning point in the history of our country. The establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was another turning point. It had cross&hyphen;party support for the recognition that reconciliation is a process which has to be worked at; it will not just happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The council, of which I and the seconder of this motion, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) are both members, is halfway through its term and it continues to need support for its processes and for its actions from parliamentarians. It needs support from its parliamentarians actively&mdash;not just tacit support. It needs support from the constituencies in working at bringing people together, in developing a better understanding of our history, in recognising the different cultures, in respecting the differences between indigenous people and the broader community while rejecting intolerance and helping to overcome some of those problems, and in fact working together actively for the future of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister and other political leaders are in the Great Hall today and they will all be speaking. I know that they will be demonstrating their commitment to this process and showing us the way at the national level. But we need to spread the message not only in the highest councils but of course right across the land. There are some 25 members on the council for reconciliation, and I will not go through them all, but there are a number of very distinguished Australians who serve on the council&mdash;people who feel that it is important that we address this subject in our community to heal some of the wounds and the difficulties that have gone before. I refer to Ian Spicer from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Jennie George from the ACTU; Robert Champion de Crespigny from the mining industry; Ian Viner, a former member of this place and a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs; and Ray Martin, who would be well known to those in the gallery, of course. Ray, apart from being a very popular media personality, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has a serious commitment to this cause and lends all the weight and authority he can to getting proper exposure in the media. Of course there is our chairman, Patrick Dodson, who I think has performed outstandingly in the last five years in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this process is not just about a few big names. It is about what we do at grassroots. As well as having the big launch here at parliament today, the things that will happen during the course of this week are going to happen at grassroots. There will also be today, for example, a flag raising ceremony and a formal launch of the week at the Adelaide town hall to mark the inaugural meeting of the South Australian Eminent Persons Group in Support of Reconciliation. Tomorrow in New South Wales there will be a launch at the Powerhouse Museum hosted by Ray Martin. On Thursday, the Australian of the Year, paediatrician Dr John Yu, and Patrick Dodson will speak on health as a reconciliation issue in a ward at Westmead Children's Hospital. Also on Thursday is the launch of a cross&hyphen;cultural awareness package for medical students and doctors announced by not only Patrick Dodson but also the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) and the New South Wales Deputy Premier, Andrew Refshauge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going to have ethnic communities involved in the activities during the course of the week. In Tasmania there will be the launch of the Tasmanian reconciliation bus, painted with the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation logo. That of course will be an activity that is most important, and it will coincide with the Tasmanian Police Academy graduation. Reconciliation and the activities of the police in this country go hand in hand because we have to deal with some of the issues of incarceration rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of key stakeholders will be here at the end of the week to talk about native title&mdash;from the mining sector, from the pastoral sector, from indigenous communities right across the board, and leaders of the community in the business and agricultural fields. In my own state of Victoria other activities will be going on this week. The Victorian eminent persons groups support the work of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1380"> council and they will have a major function in Melbourne this week. We will also have the Maribyrnong River cultural heritage trail project opened to specifically mark this week. A number of local activities are taking place and it is important that in talking about reconciliation we recognise that the focus on reconciliation must be at the grassroots level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This time next year, the focus of reconciliation week will be a major convention to be held in Melbourne. Between now and then, the council will be working hard to progress a complex but critical number of issues, including whether there should be some form of document of reconciliation. It is important to engage public interest and support in thinking through a number of the challenging questions associated with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander reconciliation with the broader community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will have some setbacks on the way but it is important that we adopt a positive attitude. We need constructive discussion where there may be disagreement. I was personally very disappointed to see an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this morning which I do not believe helps the process at all. Reconciliation is something we must discuss and debate. We may not always have the same views but it is important that we be constructive and give our full attention to these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of issues which the council believes are critical to its progress, including these key ones: understanding of country, the importance of land and sea in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies; improving relationships, looking for better relationships between indigenous Australians and the wider community; valuing cultures, recognising indigenous cultures as a valued part of Australian heritage; sharing histories, a sense for all Australians of a shared ownership of history; addressing disadvantage, the greater awareness of the causes of indigenous Australians' disadvantage; a greater community response to addressing the underlying causes of the custody levels in this country; agreeing on a document, whether the process of reconciliation would be advanced by a document or documents of reconciliation; and, finally, making sure of greater opportunities <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for indigenous Australians to control their destinies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last five years, which are but a blink in the last 200&hyphen;odd years of the history of this country, I believe we have made some progress but a lot more needs to be done. I urge all members not only to support this motion but also to actively support the process to achieve the vision of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation of a united Australia which respects this land of ours, values the Aboriginal and Torres Strait heritage and provides justice and equity for all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I second the motion. As the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, I represent the Australian Labor Party on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The council's vision is as follows: a united Australia which respects this land of ours, values the Aboriginal and Torres Strait heritage, and provides justice and equity for all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are celebrating the first National Reconciliation Week. National Reconciliation Week will be celebrated across Australia annually until the year 2001, the centenary of Federation. The dates are 27 May to 3 June, which are anniversary dates of watershed events when Australians stood up for justice and reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 27 May 1967, 90 per cent of Australians voted in a referendum to remove discriminatory clauses from the constitution and to give the Commonwealth the power to legislate for Aboriginal people. On 3 June 1992, the High Court's Mabo decision overturned the concept of terra nullius&mdash;that the continent was empty, that the land was unowned before 1788. National Reconciliation Week is an opportunity for all Australians to observe those national achievements and to take the reconciliation process a little bit further. Patrick Dodson, the council's chairperson, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By getting involved in National Reconciliation Week, Australians can stand up and be counted as people of goodwill. By pinning on a badge&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>similar to the one I wear today&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">slapping on a sticker, flying the Australian, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags together, we can demonstrate we support reconciliation and a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1381"> fair go for all Australians. Let's all share in the future of this nation. Let's work together towards the Council's vision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">a united Australia; which respects this land of ours; values the Aboriginal and Torres Strait heritage; and provides justice and equity for all.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Together we can make a difference.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>We stand here collectively as people who represent one side of the reconciliation process; namely, non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. Substantial achievements have occurred since the 1967 referendum, but we have to admit much more needs to be done. It can only be done in a spirit of goodwill, trust and a preparedness to recognise the other side has a point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, many indigenous people have lost their faith in reconciliation because it seems that at every turn they face betrayal. It seems to many that the hard fought victories of years gone by are being eroded. Governments are reneging on deals made with indigenous peoples. There are many individuals who, through sheer mean&hyphen;spiritedness, would betray indigenous people by turning back the clock on the hard won victories. Reconciliation has to be a two&hyphen;way street. It cannot be that it is always indigenous people who have to give ground every time there is a conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today is not a day for political point scoring by me. It is not a day that I come here eager to diminish my political opponents. It is a day I come here to urge greater strength of unity and understanding and offer my party's support for the reconciliation process. Reconciliation cannot be just mere words. It needs to be actioned upon. It needs to be actioned upon by all major political parties; we all are stakeholders in reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been genuine cross&hyphen;party support towards reconciliation. On the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation all major political parties are represented. The trade union movement is represented. The business community is represented. But it is fair to say that at our meeting yesterday there was a sense of despair and frustration creeping into members on the council. It was felt that in recent months prejudice and fear have been creeping into the national debate, that the blind and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prejudiced were leading the blind and prejudiced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the government on its fortitude in standing up to sections within its own party that are calling for legislation to extinguish native title in relation to pastoral leases. I commend the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for resisting the temptation to suspend the Racial Discrimination Act and to take sides. Reconciliation should be a win-win situation. It should not have to be a situation where indigenous people are required to give ground. Consultations by the government are taking place. I would urge the government not only to talk to indigenous people but also to listen to what they have to say. I believe that with goodwill we can achieve cross&hyphen;party support to resolve some problems without taking away people's rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, today is not a day for political point scoring. The Australian Labor Party will support the government in areas of reconciliation. We will look at, in a constructive fashion, legislation that is brought before this parliament. But I can say this: the support that the Australian Labor Party gives can only be given if there is a genuine spirit of goodwill being offered by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to see that the celebration taking place in the Great Hall today is being attended by all political parties. There are over 500 people in the Great Hall representing all interests. I have just left the ceremony and I will be going back there. What was moving was a song that was written and sung by Johnny Huckle. It was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Embrace Love</EMPHASIS>. The Narrabundah Primary School choir provided the backdrop. Some words of the song are: `When the power of love defeats the love of power the world will be a better place.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my belief that a united Australia which respects this land of ours, values the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage, and provides justice and equity for all will provide a better Australia for all of us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to support this motion on National Reconciliation Week, I wish first of all to recognise the people of the Ngunawal nation who originally occupied and owned this land. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1382"> In five minutes it is very difficult to cover all the issues that are so important to Australians. Rose Colless AM is an Aboriginal woman who has given her life to helping her people affected by alcohol in the Yarrabah region around Cairns. When I first met her I asked her what she thought about reconciliation. After a long pause she whispered, `I've been trying to reconcile this all my life.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About 80 kilometres north of Weipa on the Cape is a place called Mapoon. In November 1963, after months of protracted negotiations, the mining companies decided that they needed to clear the land of Aboriginal people to legally use it for their mining leases. In November 1963&mdash;not 1863 but 1963&mdash;the police and the people from the mining companies came and cleared the land of Aboriginal people. At gunpoint the people were forced into boats and they were dispersed to Bamaga in the tip of the Cape and as far south as Cairns. Then homes were bulldozed and burned. When I was there in July 1994&mdash;the community is rebuilding itself&mdash;I met a woman called Constance Cooktown, who had been there that day. She had been out fishing with her husband and returned to find the homes and the houses burning and her children gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At Walgett in western New South Wales I spoke to an Aboriginal woman who tearfully recounted seeing, as a little girl, a family of children being taken away on the back of a mission truck. She said to me, `I can still see that little girl on the back of the truck. She must have been about six, with a little rag hat on. She went away and we never seen her any more. She was crying. Everyone was crying. Things like that never leave your memory.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992 I was a year away from taking over the leadership of the Australian Medical Association. I recall asking one of the senior bureaucrats in the organisation who in our office was working on Aboriginal health. I was told that nobody was. Yet here was an organisation that was probably&mdash;and is probably&mdash;the peak organisation to represent the interests of the medical profession and the concerns of the community on health care in Australia. Not one page of the Aboriginal deaths in custody royal commission report, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which had volumes on health, had been opened in that office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thinking in terms of what reconciliation is all about, amongst other things it is calling on Australians, wherever they are from and whatever organisations they may represent, to challenge and change the attitudes of a section of this society who seem not to appreciate what has happened in the past. What this country needs is a deficit reduction strategy on Aboriginal death, intolerance and prejudice. Whatever else we achieve as a nation, if we make no progress at all in this area then, as far as I am concerned, we will have achieved nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During this national week of reconciliation, Australians should ask themselves and ask their children, `How would I feel if this was done to me?' In asking the question, the meaning of reconciliation will be found. It is about all of us&mdash;black and white&mdash;not for a day or a week but for the remainder of our lives asking ourselves how we would feel and trying to put ourselves in the place of another person. As one of the newly elected members said in issuing a challenge to some members in this place, `You come out to some of these Aboriginal areas and tell me you wish you had been born there.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Batman)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.56 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I stand here today to speak as part of National Reconciliation Week, I think back on my experiences of working in the Northern Territory, working cooperatively and in a practical manner with large groups of Aboriginal workers, both traditional and non-traditional, who enrolled as members of my union, the North Australian Workers Union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is through this experience and through my work with such people as Ella Ahmat, Denise Ahsam and Jim and Bingy Clarke that I have come to believe that Australia cannot expect to find real reconciliation until we face up to a number of key areas of deprivation which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people face. Those areas, I suggest, include housing, jobs, education and health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The indigenous people I have worked with have always said that they ask for nothing more than to be treated as equals and to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1383"> recognised as the first peoples who lived in and worked this great land of ours. In these short moments I want to talk about how we endeavour to overcome the huge barriers that exist before Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can truly say they have equality with all other Australians. That is what reconciliation is all about: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people having equality with all other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say very clearly today that I believe progress is being made and the story is not all negative. In doing so, I refer specifically to some of our successes in the state of Queensland. I refer to the Aboriginal communities at Cherbourg and Shalom College in Townsville as positive stories of where we are making progress as a community. However, it is visits to places like this which give hope that these small sparks of light will quickly spread and glow like a bushfire and therefore make sure that we glow the light of reconciliation across the great length and breadth of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, both these communities have used the problem of providing housing to their communities as the hook to resolve other key issues such as education and training and jobs. As you can appreciate, access to housing and the quality of our housing is something most Australians see as a fundamental right. Unfortunately, that is not the case in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. In fact, very few Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders ever expect to be home owners. More importantly, it is now internationally recognised that their housing is of a quality closer to Third World standards than to what we would normally expect as Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Real reconciliation will only come when we can ensure that the majority of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander brothers and sisters know that as a natural right their housing standards, wherever they live, are equal to those of almost any house in any town, city or suburb of this country. I also praise those communities because in facing up to their housing needs they have sought to bring in state and federal government departments of labour and in so doing use the labour market programs to provide practical training and employment opportunities which have then <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> created a sense of pride and achievement in the local communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that note, I believe we as a parliament should do everything possible to ensure that those types of programs continue so that these communities have the opportunity to face up in a very practical sense to their own ability to go forward and to dedicate sufficient local resources, in association with government support, to provide those opportunities that not only mean real training and jobs but also make a fundamental improvement to the standard of living in their local communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reconciliation will only work for all Australians if we look practically at ways to give our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander brothers and sisters opportunities for real jobs, good education, quality health care and appropriate housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr LINDSAY</EMPHASIS> (Herbert) (1.01 p.m.) I encourage the people of Herbert and all the schools, community organisations and business groups throughout Townsville and Thuringowa to get involved in National Reconciliation Week. Francis Tapim, the Executive Director of Magani Malu Kes, the Torres Strait Islander Resource Centre in Townsville, has asked me to pass on to the parliament, on behalf of that group, his message. Mr Tapim said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want everyone to come together and respect each other's cultural values&mdash;united as one, all Australians together.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is past is in the past. There was great social injustice. But let's move on and get on with the challenges that lie ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We just want everyone to come together and recognise that all of us in Australia have something to offer.</PARA>
<PARA>Francis Tapim's attitude gives me heart that reconciliation is achievable and will be rewarding for all Australians. But reconciliation does not just happen; we need to continually work at it over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women have a significantly lower life expectancy than non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. The infant mortality rate for indigenous children is much higher. Indigenous Australians lag behind in employment and in access to all areas of education. They are over&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1384">represented in our gaols and under&hyphen;represented in the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day decision making processes at all levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Palm Island is an Aboriginal settlement located in my electorate, and it is probably the suicide capital of Australia. Over the last two months there has been, on average, one suicide a week. The vast majority of these people are aged between 17 and 25&mdash;a shocking statistic when you consider that 50 per cent of Islanders are under the age of 25.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reconciliation process must include providing indigenous people with better access to appropriate health and mental health services, fair and equitable access to education services, and more culturally relevant education curriculums. Improving the educational facilities and supporting appropriate curriculum changes will go a long way towards improving the standard of living on Palm Island&mdash;it may even save lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reconciliation process should also pursue employment programs for indigenous Australians. Speaking on Aboriginal employment in March 1981, former Senator Neville Bonner, who is in the parliament today and who is a person who knows what life can be like on Palm Island, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no sense in creating employment opportunities which will not be satisfactory for Aboriginal people and which will not give them a sense of responsibility and sense of achievement. They want to contribute something to the Australian way of life. That is the kind of employment that we want.</PARA>
<PARA>Palm Islanders do not want handouts. They want the opportunity to work for real jobs, for better health and for a sense of self&hyphen;satisfaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly support my colleague in the Senate, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Grant Tambling, who continues to say that regional development projects can involve a successful working partnership with indigenous Australians. Yet, at the same time, we are seeing projects with tremendous employment and economic potential, such as Century Zinc, jeopardised by questions of native title. It is no wonder people are questioning the workability of the Native Title Act. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise that the economic future of this country depends on resource development, and I intend to support laws which will not allow people who do not have a substantial claim to stall development for years. But I also do not intend to allow these necessary changes to ride roughshod over the rights of indigenous Australians. Reconciliation is a two&hyphen;way street and the coalition government is working to realise appropriate outcomes for both parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate Townsville State High School has taken up the challenge, with an indigenous studies course being offered this year. So far it has been very successful. When I visited the school just three weeks ago, I saw the class in action. Do you know what? The majority of the class were not indigenous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The timing of National Reconciliation Week is opportune. Hopefully, this week will help re&hyphen;focus attention on the need to continue to push ahead and to further the cause of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander reconciliation in Australia. I certainly support the motion, and I close with these words: `When the power of love defeats the love for power, Australia will be a better place.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have an opportunity to associate myself with a bipartisan motion of this kind, and I congratulate the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) on ensuring that it came forward. I congratulate the parliament and the Selection Committee as well on making sure that it came on to the program today. While we are here now, the inaugural National Reconciliation Week luncheon is taking place in the Great Hall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate the comments that were made by the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who concluded with a reference to some words that were sung at that luncheon just a short time ago by Johnny Huckle. Singing with him were the children from the Narrabundah Primary School choir here in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Johnny Huckle introduced that song by saying that he was talking to a little child from Bosnia and that the child was crying. He asked the child why she was crying, and this child from Bosnia&mdash;with all the trauma and the dramas associated with those particular <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1385"> circumstances&mdash;said it was because Johnny Huckle was singing songs that caused her to be sad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasise those words that the member for Herbert referred to as well. The song that Johnny Huckle sang included these words: `When the power of love defeats the lust for power, the world will be a better place.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I doubt whether there is anything more central to the whole question of reconciliation. Indigenous Australians occupied this continent for 60,000 years. European occupation, European settlement, has existed for only 200 years. When the Reverend Ian Allsop delivered the prayer at the luncheon in the Great Hall, he also said, `Help us to resolve conflict and to right the wrongs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever non-indigenous Australians might say about the circumstances of the last 200 years and about how Aboriginal Australians were brought to the verge of extinction, there has been at least some degree of reconciliation in their thinking. I hope that this reconciliation in their thinking makes a major contribution to the practical efforts that are being made by people now and that will hopefully be made by people right across Australia to bring about a reconciliation between non-indigenous and indigenous Australians. That is not going to be an easy task, particularly because of the nature of the problems that indigenous Australians have and the fact that there are still some people in Australia who say that Aboriginal Australians are getting too much money thrown at them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can people say that in relation to, for example, health services? Aboriginal Australians have a life expectancy significantly lower than that of European Australians. Aboriginal infant mortality is significantly higher than that of European Australians. Young Aboriginal kids are suffering from diseases that are endemic in Third World countries. Aboriginal families are living under sheets of corrugated iron. Is there too much money being thrown at Aboriginal housing? In some places the rate of Aboriginal unemployment is up to 90 per cent. The average rate of unemployment for Aboriginal people in Australia is 38 per cent. Is too much money being thrown at their employment prospects?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate has a very active organisation called the Manning Valley Australians for Reconciliation. They organised a fund raising dinner for 17 April this year. We had the honour of having Mr Patrick Dodson, chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, as guest speaker at that dinner. I had the opportunity of talking with Pat Dodson on the day he was in Taree at a civic reception that was put on by Mayor Les Brown and again at the dinner at which he spoke. I also had the opportunity to talk to a number of other speakers at that dinner. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manning River Times</EMPHASIS> had a report on the fundraising dinner and Pat Dodson's visit to Taree. That report was very aptly headlined `Window of opportunity'. It states:</PARA>

<PARA>Councillor Les Brown made those comments at the civic reception that was accorded to Patrick Dodson when he visited Taree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Manning Valley Australians for Reconciliation was recently formed and this year it plans to promote reconciliation in the community. Its definition of reconciliation is `understanding and respect of all cultures'. Its aims are: to further encourage and promote mutual awareness and respect for the heritage and cultures of both the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities through the reconciliation process; to provide a positive information exchange; to develop active programs to promote reconciliation for the Manning community; and to consult and advise council, government departments, community organisations and the public on issues relating to reconciliation. It is interesting to note the diversity of the people involved in Manning Valley Australians for Reconciliation. They are not just indigenous people but also non-indigenous people. I would like to record in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the efforts of the joint chairpersons of that organisation, Krishna Heffernan and Judith Johnston, and the secretary, Judy Browne.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this motion. Since we are talking about reconciliation, I thought that I should perhaps offer a dictionary definition of what it means to reconcile. The dictionary says that it is to restore to friendship or harmony. The word `harmony' has a sense of peace about it. Being at peace with oneself and at peace with one another is perhaps one of the highest states that human beings can aspire to. Friendship is to esteem or value people. I think it is most appropriate that we should wish to value and esteem our Aboriginal Australians. After all, they are the original occupants of this land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate I am often asked what this means. Does it mean that this current generation should accept the guilt for the past 200 years? I think the answer to that is no. But I think it is also about understanding the history of the last 200 years. Therefore, I support this idea that the more we can publicise and make Australians understand the history of the Aboriginal people, that will go a long way to affording us to appropriately recognise and reconcile with them the injustices of the last 200 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the publication put out by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Together</EMPHASIS>, is the story of Lily's daughter. Lois O'Donoghue, the Chairperson of ATSIC, like many other Aboriginals, was ripped away from her mother and family. I do not think Australians really understand the impact of this on families. It just did not happen once; it was a serial activity that occurred in New South Wales right up to the 1960s. Today I am enjoying the company of my eldest daughter and granddaughter. I reflected on what it would be like to have her snatched away from the family, or to even have her mother snatched away. We have a lot to overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1387"> I am pleased to say that I have a lot of Aboriginals in my own electorate. I am very proud of them. I am also proud that I fly the Australian flag in my electorate office as well as the Aboriginal flag. In terms of the disad vantage suffered by Aboriginals in my electorate, when I first was a member of parliament I believed I had no Aboriginal students in year 11 and 12. Today I have 25, which is probably a retention rate of between 15 and 20 per cent, with the rest of Australia having about 70 to 80 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about reconciliation&mdash;other members have contributed to it&mdash;it is really about Aboriginals getting a fair crack at education and employment, the way we would wish for our own children and indeed all children. Again, I do not look at the unemployment rate for Aboriginals in my electorate because it is just so high, but it is not to say that they are not without undoubted ability and talent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We always talk about the Aboriginal connection with the land, saying that this is a spiritual connection. I do not know that all of us can aspire to have that depth of understanding and feel for it, but I can say that there are many non-Aboriginals who, when we are at sea or when we are working the land, have a spiritual connection with it. I am certainly one of those. Therefore, I can better appreciate how important that is to the Aboriginals and how important the Mabo decision is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope in the future&mdash;because we live in a task and target oriented society&mdash;that other speakers speaking next year to a similar motion will be able to talk about the great achievements and successes we have enjoyed in the last 12 months and the real confidence we have in facing the turn of the century and ensuring that Aboriginal Australians are valued, esteemed, restored to friendship and restored to harmony.</PARA>

<PARA>It is on behalf of the people of my electorate that I move this motion today. I convey their sympathy to the family, friends and loved ones of the victims of the Port Arthur massacre. The massacre had a profound impact not only on the small community of Port Arthur but also on the wider Australian community. The Broad Arrow Cafe will be demolished and the perpetrator of the crime will be punished, but this will not be enough. While the motives behind such a massacre are complex and not easily understood, lessons must be learnt and some good must result from this tragedy. Of course, there are issues related to mental illness to be considered but, overwhelmingly, the central issue is: do we accept a culture of violence or do we work against that as a matter of urgency?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the lead-up to the 1988 presidential elections in the United States, George Bush said that he wanted a kinder, gentler America. Perhaps it was already too late for America, but it is not too late for Australia. But it will take women and men of considerable strength and determination to ensure a kinder, gentler Australia where there is less violence and therefore more personal safety and freedom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has shown the necessary leadership to achieve not only tighter gun control but also uniform laws. He has been supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot). They must all be commended for the political <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1388"> support and sympathy they have shown to the survivors of the massacre and for those who now seek a safer, less violent society, free of the gun culture which is so entrenched in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, this motion also pays tribute to the medical staff and health professionals, the ambulance workers, the emergency service people and the police who responded to all the emergencies that followed the massacre. They will never forget 28 April 1996. Dr Bryan Walpole, Chief Surgeon at Royal Hobart Hospital, led the team of doctors and nurses who treated and cared for the survivors of the massacre. He is quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 11 May as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We went to war for a day in Tasmania and we saw on the bodies of all those people the havoc the weapons of war can wreak.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If anything can come from what those people endured&mdash;the victims, the families, the friends, the ambulance workers, the emergency services people, the police, the doctors, the nurses&mdash;then there has to be change on gun control.</PARA>
<PARA>A similar message came from Pastor Allan Armstrong, who conducted the funeral service for Nanette, six&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Alannah and three&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Madeleine Mikac. All the deaths were horrific, but a young mother dying trying to protect her children was just too much for many of us. Pastor Armstrong said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a nation we have the ability to give to our mothers a safer society for their children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To our national leaders we say do not trade your votes for lives. Hold to your resolve to deal with the menace of unnecessary firearms in our society.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Listen not to the loud calls of the few who want to selfishly keep their weapons but instead hear the cries of those who have died, listen to the quiet sobs of those who live, see the majority who stand with them. Deliver to us uniform laws that will give our children the best possible chance to live without the fear of someone having access to violent power that can maim and kill.</PARA>
<PARA>These messages have been heeded and, after an all&hyphen;day meeting on 10 May, the Prime Minister made the following announcement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth and the States and Territories today agreed on a uniform and tougher approach to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gun laws which will make Australia a safer place to live.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement includes a ban on automatic and semi automatic rifles and shotguns and a nationwide approach to registration and licensing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian community demanded urgent and effective action on tougher gun laws and today all governments have answered that call with a comprehensive action plan which will deliver effective nationwide controls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have agreed to prohibit the importation, ownership, sale, resale, transfer, possession, manufacture or use of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">all military-style centre-fire rifles including those which substantially duplicate military styles;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">all other self-loading centre-fire rifles;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">all self-loading and pump-action shotguns and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">all self-loading rim fire rifles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importation ban will be effective immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exceptions will be a limited range of official or occupational purposes certified by a permit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Action will be taken to strictly regulate mail orders.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend everyone who worked towards the historic agreement brokered to give Australia the opportunity to avoid the gun culture which has so impacted on the ordinary citizens of some other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I trust there will be the same resolve as complementary laws are passed around the country. The loss of life at Port Arthur has become a catalyst for action following on other recent multiple killings in Australia where guns were used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In August 1987, seven people were shot in Melbourne in the Hoddle Street killings; in December 1987, eight people were killed in Melbourne in the Queen Street massacre; in August 1990, five people were shot in Surry Hills, Sydney; in August 1991, six people were shot and one stabbed in the Strathfield Shopping Plaza, Sydney; in October 1992, six people were shot by a lone gunman on the central coast of New South Wales; in August 1993, three people were shot dead by a gunman in the inner west of Sydney; and in January 1996, seven people were shot dead in a murder&hyphen;suicide in a Brisbane suburb.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been estimated that 84 per cent of victims in mass killings between 1987 and 1993 were killed by a licensed gun holder, while 86 per cent of the victims were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1389"> reportedly killed by a person with no record of violent crime or mental illness. The statistics on mass killings are chilling but other statistics are more chilling and should stand alone as a single reason&mdash;if one single reason was needed&mdash;to severely restrict the availability of guns. In 1994, 420 Australians used a firearm to commit suicide and 76 Australians were the victims of intentional killing, often by people known to them or family members. So guns play a big role in domestic homicides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firearms contribute to death and injury in two ways: first in terms of their availability and second because they are lethal. The National Committee on Violence found that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The vast majority of firearms homicides are unplanned and impulsive, and in all likelihood would not occur if such a lethal weapon were not to hand. The availability of a firearm in these circumstances makes death a far greater likelihood, for research has demonstrated that the death rate for victims assaulted by guns is several times that of those assaulted with lethal intent by knives or other weapons.</PARA>
<PARA>I have spoken with Dr Steve Zubrick, who has conducted significant research into these issues and who has told me that, with a gun in the home, the risk of suicide is increased by 25 per cent. He says a gun is a `totally unforgiving device&mdash;it is designed to do a job and it does it well'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, there will be law&hyphen;abiding, good people inconvenienced by tighter gun control, but they are not well served by those who speak of bloodshed, of civil disobedience or of blaming the homosexual community for community attitudes which now demand action for a less violent society. I have had letters and contact from pro&hyphen;gun lobbyists in my electorate office, some of those with legitimate inquiries but, in the main, I have had contact from those who reflect the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> poll of 2-5 May 1996 which showed that 90 per cent of those surveyed supported a national ban on all automatic and semi&hyphen;automatic fire arms. Eighty&hyphen;eight per cent supported firearms registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are those who argue they have a right to own firearms. I remind them of the major contribution to the agreed reforms of our Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams). He said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gun ownership is not a right. Rather it should be seen as a conditional privilege reserved for those with a genuine reason and subject to appropriate controls.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to conclude by quoting from some letters I have received on this subject. A resident of Prospect, in my electorate, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You received our support in March now it is time to give the majority of Australians your support.</PARA>
<PARA>From a city dweller:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the brighter side, think of the very positive signal tighter gun control laws will send to foreign tourists&mdash;would you rather take your chances on the streets of New York or LA or visit a country which is actively reducing the number of guns and gun owners?</PARA>
<PARA>From another:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have never felt so proud of an Australian Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, a specialist physician describes gun control as `superb preventative medicine'. I commend the motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It goes without saying that I support the sentiments of the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) in the first part of her motion. I thank her for her support of the people of my electorate and of my state. There was a lot of suffering and a lot of grief, but now life must go on. These people are picking themselves up and are coming face to face with a rather bleak tourism outlook unless we can help them further. I hope she will continue to support the state and the state's need for some special assistance because of the trauma that we have experienced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, along with my colleague in the other place, Senator Shayne Murphy, have written to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) seeking to follow up the promise he made to the state during the election in relation to the $49.5 million worth of Bass Strait subsidy travel. It was to be allocated over three years with the third&hyphen;year amount being the greatest&mdash;that is, $22.5 million. We are seeking, and meekly asking, that the third&hyphen;year amount become the first&hyphen;year amount, and that the $19.1 million <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1390"> come forward to try and help kick&hyphen;start the tourist numbers for this year and for next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plan includes a passenger and car subsidy and an accommodation rebate for this year. It also takes into account the rebuilding of the cafe-information centre which is so vital to the economy of this site. I hope members of this House will be in a position to try and help Tasmania out of its current difficulty by supporting the idea. It is a chance for all of us to readily express our sympathy practically and to give thanks to those who worked so tirelessly during that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also add that there is an appeal running around Parliament House with the maple leaf stickers. Twelve federal Tasmanian parliamentarians from across the political spectrum have all put in $100 to pay for another 20,000 stickers to be distributed around Tasmania, Parliament House and the rest of Australia. If all are sold it means that our politicians have helped raise another $40,000 towards this appeal. So I thank all those people who responded so promptly and without any persuasion to assist in this appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other part of motion moved by the member for Adelaide goes to guns and gun laws and the efforts of all parties to have a consistent view on how to deal with the question of guns and gun ownership. The last government banned military style automatic and semiautomatic weapons from importation through the Customs Act and by using the Customs Service. It also banned ammunition&mdash;the bullets that arm those weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But a meeting of the state police ministers in Launceston&mdash;at which a proposal to ban their use for private and mail order sales and for tougher licensing and training schemes and storage of weapons&mdash;fell apart because of the resistance of some states, and chiefly my own state. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), my colleague from Tasmania, is here. Of course, in the last government he was the Minister for Justice. He had put that on the agenda and was carrying the motion forward at the ministers conference, which unfortunately did not see fit to pick up on those matters.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has taken the shock and the terrible tragedy at Port Arthur to put the debate back on the rails. The motion of the member for Adelaide points out that all sides have to be positively involved. I hope that, this time, sense will prevail to make sure that we have the best legislation we can get. I am sure the member for Adelaide supports that. I know she would.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate there are many law&hyphen;abiding citizens who own guns. They will be inconvenienced by the legislation because it has gone far further than it was ever envisaged to go last year or in the years past. But I do not think it is impossible to make it work; I believe that we can make it work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was heartened to hear from the New South Wales Shooting Association Ltd that they support the directions of agreed resolutions on gun control announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 10 May 1996, and that they have been advocating similar proposals since 1991. Their organisation is the official New South Wales member for the sport in the Olympic Games, the Commonwealth Games and other meets around our country. National meets hold up the structures that bring our shooters together throughout the year to compete and reach the ones who go on to represent us at the Olympic Games and at the Commonwealth Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been trying today to contact bodies in my own area to see what their views are. I believe that they would not be very different from those of the New South Wales Shooting Association. Where sports requirements or other legitimate reasons for having a particular style gun require changes to the gun laws in some way, I believe we can negotiate our way through it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we want to follow the lead of the United States, which has guns as part of its culture of personal defence and aggression. That has never been a part of our culture. We have never had guns tied to ourselves for those reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Guns have a place in such sports as target shooting and hunting and on farms where there are legitimate uses and people are trained from an early age to handle guns with safety and responsibility. When I was a young <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1391"> man growing up on the farm, I was taught the responsibility of using a gun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of great significance, when I look back on it, that my father let us learn to shoot only with a single shot shotgun or a single shot .22. If I went off with five bullets and came back without any bullets and without any rabbits, I was in some difficulty because I had failed the test of being able to shoot straight. His idea was that you should learn to shoot correctly if you have only a single shot shotgun. I think that is probably very true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think anyone would disagree that legislators have to do something. I am sure that if we all work together we can achieve a much safer and a more informed Australia. I thank the honourable member for permitting me to speak again on the issue. I hope she will visit Tasmania and see for herself what a truly beautiful and peaceful place it is despite the recent events that we have had to endure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), all police ministers and all opposition spokespeople who have given their support. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on supporting the Prime Minister on every occasion during the debate on this topic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion also recognises, rightly, the outstanding work done by the police and emergency services during the tragedy. I extend that to include all volunteers involved. We all would have read different stories about individuals going to the scene of the tragedy to assist those who had been shot. They were courageous beyond description. I commend them for their services. I particularly congratulate those workers at the Royal Hobart Hospital, who were mentioned by the member for Adelaide. They had a horrendous time during and following the massacre. Their work deserves greater recognition.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1392">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those who were involved are true Australians. I think it would be fitting if those people, as a group, were nominated for the Australian of the Year award. A group has won that award before. I think those who went beyond the normal course of individual commitment, who displayed the true Australian spirit and courage and who united our nation in the face of adversity, would be extremely worthy nominees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their courage and actions define the Australian spirit. No one person represents them, but as a group those emergency services people, the volunteers, the hospital staff&mdash;all those involved&mdash;are great Australians and would be worthy recipients of the Australian of the Year award. I do acknowledge that the decision to ban certain guns will inconvenience many law-abiding citizens, and I offer my apologies. However, the right to live in safety far outweighs the right to bear arms. If this law saves one Australian, it is a law worth having; it will be working. I am confident that it will save many more than just one Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I have suggested to the Prime Minister that, as an addition to the Medicare levy to fund the gun buyback, the metal parts of the guns handed back be melted down and made into medallions commemorating a safe Australia. This could be coordinated by the Mint and sold to those many Australians who want to invest in making our great nation safer. I call it taking out insurance for making Australia safer. The War Memorial, as all would probably know, sells pens from melted down nuclear warheads. Perhaps we could do the same with the metal parts of those guns. I commend the initiative and the motion to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by noting that a 29&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Western Australian man was killed on Friday night at a town called Borden, near Gnowangerup, in the Western Australian wheat belt. He was accidentally shot in the back of the head. The gun involved was one that would be banned under the proposed laws.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I met with residents of Wattle Grove because their local member, the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale), refuses to meet them. Today I speak in this House on behalf of those residents because their local member refuses to speak on their behalf. Where is she today? She should be in this House jumping to her feet and voicing her opposition to the way in which the Liberal Party has foisted upon her constituents its secret plan for an international airport at Holsworthy. This is a plan which will destroy the lifestyle, the aspirations and the property values for tens of thousands of residents in the seat of Hughes and the surrounding electorates in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the test the Liberal Party applied before the election? It was that they were happier, they were more content, to speak to big business interests about their secret plan than the people of the region. They were happy to go through a debate for 12 months in the lead-up to the election. If you stacked up all the press statements, the announcements, the speeches and the bills in this House that the member for Bennelong, the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), used in that airport debate prior to the election you could not jump over them. There was not a word, not a whisper, of their plan to introduce two 5,000&hyphen;metre runways and an east&hyphen;west runway at Holsworthy to jeopardise the lifestyle of every single person in the south&hyphen;west corridor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the member for Hughes? She was elected on false pretences. She is now collecting her salary on false pretences. She did not tell the people in her electorate of this airport plan before 2 March, and now she refuses to represent them in this House.

The Munupi Arts and Crafts Association, with assistance from the Australia Council, is organising a Tiwi potters exhibition at the 8th National Ceramic Council. Eddie was invited to participate in the 8th National Ceramic Council as a featured artist and to exhibit Tiwi pottery. Sadly, he passed away along with his eldest son, Cecil, in September 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Puruntatemeri family is determined to continue the pottery. Eddie's youngest son, Robert, is working towards learning to manage the pottery to continue his father's dream of a successful Tiwi pottery. His daughter, Karen, is also a potter and president of the Munupi association. His wife, Maree, is also continuing to work as a potter. The family will be attending the exhibition, opening on 4 July. Tiwi potters will also participate in the international pottery workshops in Canberra as part of the conference. I understand that some 90 pieces of Munupi art will be on display.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express my concern at the lack of representation that the electorate of Hughes is getting. As the member for the seat most affected by Sydney airport, I am horrified at the sheer lack of concern displayed and lack of comments made by the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale). The member for Hughes was not even bothered to be told that there was going to be an international airport in her electorate until 8 o'clock the night before the announcement <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was made by the minister. It is the same spirit of consultation which was seen from this new government which will see the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) appointed chair of the Sydney Airport Community Consultative Committee. It seems if you are not on the North Shore you don't matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard no comment since from the member for Hughes. She was dragged off 2BL by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), who did not think she had a right to make a comment. At 5.30 p.m. last Friday she was due to debate with the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) on radio 2BL, the Mike Carlton program, and, once again, she did not front. It was left to the member for North Sydney to represent the interests of the people in Hughes, which is not surprising, given that the current member lives in Gymea outside her own electorate and a fair way away from Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is no excuse for the residents around Holsworthy and for suburbs such as Wattle Grove being ignored. I invite the member for Hughes, if she ever decides to get out from her bunker, to visit Sydenham in my electorate if she wants to see the impact that aircraft noise can have.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker spoke of decency, and I think it shows he really does have the hide of a rhinoceros. We are talking about the decency of those in government at the moment. It has become clear now that a significant number of the frontbench on the opposite side had prior knowledge of this issue during the whole election campaign. Quite clearly they have not revealed that to the constituents of Hughes. It is an issue that has affected many seats in western Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, in the electorates of Parramatta, Prospect and my own the Liberal Party has been fundamentally behind many of these campaigns about the future of the airport.

They have known about this proposal and they have not had the decency to allow people in that seat to know anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hughes (Mrs Vale) has an advantage that few have.

To come out defending those electors, to come <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out raising those issues and to put them here before the parliament could quite clearly indicate that perhaps she did not know about it.

Unlike the out-of-date environmental study where they did not even take into account the flight paths at Badgerys Creek, we are talking about the enormous number of residents who are basically moving out along the M4 and down the M5 into residential projects, who would be horrendously affected by the aircraft noise around Badgerys Creek airport.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am surprised that the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) did not raise this afternoon the fact that they, for example, employ 6,500 people in the Northern Territory in 45 different communities. Any delay in their ongoing operation will have a devastating effect on employment and welfare in these communities.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition asks a question that can be equally as well answered by members on his own side. We did in opposition precisely what they did in government; in other words, members on this side of the House heard a proposal put by a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> certain gentleman who had a scheme called the Lawrence Hargrave project.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I am happy to inform the House that arrangements have been made for me to visit Tokyo from 7 to 10 August and Jakarta from 11 to 13 August. This visit represents a further affirmation of the importance that the new government places on relations between this country and the countries of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. In saying that, I quite freely acknowledge the contribution that was made to the building of good relations between Australia and the nations of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region by a series of Prime Ministers: Prime Ministers Whitlam, Hawke and Keating of the Labor bent and Prime Ministers Menzies, Holt, Gorton, McMahon and Fraser on the coalition side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more ridiculous, stupid, infantile comments that was made during the election campaign was the suggestion that the leaders of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region would not deal with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1397"> a coalition Prime Minister. I think we have demonstrated the contrary very quickly. I want to compliment the work of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, both of whom have made very important visits to the region. By their actions, they have demonstrated the importance that we attach to our relations with the nations of that region. It is a common commitment, I would have thought, on both sides of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would serve the interests of Australia well if that commitment were more readily acknowledged on the other side of the House. I noticed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program yesterday that diplomat extraordinaire, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith. Somebody had not given him the more up to date hymn sheet because he was still singing the old hymn, that is, that nobody in Asia likes us. It all seems rather pathetic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a difference. The difference is not the level of commitment between us and the opposition in relation to our links with the countries of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. Unlike the former government, the new government does not see the associations that this country has with the nations of Europe and North America as being a liability in our dealings with the nations of our region; rather, we see them complementing our dealings with the nations of that region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indonesia and Japan are, of course, amongst the most important countries with which Australia has links. It is no accident that Japan's economic relations with Australia are so deep and abiding. It was, after all, a coalition Prime Minister, Menzies, and a coalition Deputy Prime Minister, McEwen, who were responsible in 1957 for the signing of the Australia&hyphen;Japan trade agreement. Be it remembered that the signing of that trade agreement was strenuously opposed in 1957 by the Australian Labor Party. They do not like being reminded of it, but it remains the fact. It is just a demonstration of the humbug in their pretending that, in some way, they are the authors, the parents, of the great relationship between Australia and the nations of the region. </PARA>

Even in relation to New South Wales, the Carr Labor government claims it will be bringing down <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a surplus in 1996&hyphen;97.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After we entered government, the question of Badgerys Creek and the coalition's commitment to an environmental impact study for it was raised with me and was the subject of some considerable discussion. The possibility of a negative outcome from an environmental impact study of Badgerys Creek was raised with me. I asked people in my department, and indeed anyone else who had any ideas about a second airport solution for Sydney, what other sites are available if Badgerys Creek gets a negative outcome for its environmental impact study.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only sites that were available that had any prospect at all were sites like Richmond. Richmond was regarded as being unsuitable because the runway at Richmond is 2,000 metres in length and you need a runway that is at least 4,000 metres in length. It would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1401"> also require virtually the removal of one very historic township, a move I think most people would have been unhappy with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out to the honourable gentleman asking the question that one of the concerns raised was that, if you went outside of Richmond or the site that we finally chose as an alternative or backup site, that is Holsworthy, and wanted to minimise the delays that would be incurred if Badgerys Creek got a negative EIS, the only way you could go about it was to look at alternative sites that were currently 100 per cent owned by the Commonwealth, which limited it to either Holsworthy or Richmond. If you found, as you were gambling on, that Badgerys Creek got a negative EIS, we would have had to go right back to the drawing board and we would have had several years further delay in building a second airport for Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sydneysiders are sick and tired of the 10 years of delay, the 10 years of fast talking and slow tracking, on Badgerys Creek. So I said, `If we are going to resolve this problem as quickly as possible, the only way to do it is go to an area that the Commonwealth currently owns 100 per cent of.' To go anywhere else&mdash;to go to Goulburn, Wilton or other airport sites that have been mooted around Sydney&mdash;would only lead to further delays and further inconvenience for the people who are suffering as a result of aircraft noise in Sydney and would lead to further cynicism about any government's resolve to fix the problem of a second airport in Sydney, which has been on the agenda for 30 years.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Today is the first day of National Reconciliation Week and many honourable members today attended a lunch hosted jointly by the Prime Minister, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the reconciliation process is attempting to address the terrible state of the health of Aboriginal Australians. To this end, my department has responsibility for Aboriginal health. I say two things at the outset. The first is that if we are going to be honest it is going to take the best part of a generation to make a very substantial improvement in the health of Aboriginal and Islander Australians. If we look to the example of countries similar to us, such as Canada or New Zealand, which have substantial indigenous populations, we see that this has been their  experience. It also gives us some cause for hope because it shows us that improvements can be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing I say at the outset is that government must realise that its capacity to do anything is limited because it cannot act unilaterally. In the end, we have to do this with the cooperation of states and territories and of Aboriginal and Islander organisations and people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My department has four initiatives under way that I hope will collectively take some steps towards this end. The first initiative is that of looking to better coordinate Aboriginal specific programs with mainstream health systems. If there is one thing we could do that would substantially help Aboriginal and Islander people it would be for states and territories to provide, as far as possible, the same level of service to them as they provide to any of their citizens. In the past, the two levels of government have not talked together. This has led to situations where you have one level of government funding capital and another level of government not prepared to fund recurrent services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a draft agreement go around to all states and I hope to be signing the first one within a month. This will mean that under this agreement two things will happen. The first is that the Commonwealth, states and territories will sit down to jointly plan needs, have a look at where the gaps are and see what we can do to fill in those gaps. Secondly, we will be having the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, NACCHO, and the Aboriginal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1402"> and Torres Strait Islander Commission at the table. The four players in the health area will be jointly planning priorities and how to meet them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also looking at new approaches to service delivery. As part of the COAG process there are opportunities for coordinated care trials. A number of trials are well progressed in WA, the Northern Territory and New South Wales. These are very exciting because they have the capacity to turn Aboriginal health completely on its head. For example, we are looking at a trial in the Tiwi Islands in the Northern Territory whereby the Commonwealth, states and the Tiwi Health Council would jointly fund a renal dialysis service for Tiwi people suffering from the highest known level of kidney disease known in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other one we are looking at is Katherine, where the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory government would look to be cashing out their health dollar and providing it to the local community so that they can meet their own needs. What is quite radical about this is that they would actually be rewarded for keeping people well rather than being rewarded when people are sick. The third thing we are doing is looking to develop particular strategies to combat specific health problems, particularly sexual health. To this end, last week I met with ANCA, the Australian National Council on AIDS. They have a working group on indigenous sexual health under Dr Ian Anderson from Victoria and we are hoping that they can lead the fight against HIV&hyphen;AIDS in Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I now have agreement about the make&hyphen;up of the national Aboriginal and Islander health council. I have sent out letters of invitation and I hope to be able to make an announcement on this in the near future. It will be chaired by my department and will be reporting directly to me. I hope this direct input will provide the resources and the knowledge that we need to do our part at a Commonwealth level. Collectively, I hope these four initiatives will make a small start on what will be a generational task to improve Aboriginal and Islander health.</PARA>

I thank the Leader of the Opposition for asking me a question about Telstra. Let me say a few things to the parliament about Telstra, about the relationship between the executive and the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the last election, the coalition was elected overwhelmingly with a mandate to do a number of things, one of which was to sell one-third of Telstra. After the election, somebody made a suggestion to me and to one of my colleagues that maybe it would be possible to achieve the policy by means of forming a new company and transferring the assets. I quite happily tell the House that, when that suggestion was put to me, I had the suggestion sent to the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department for advice. I am quite happy to tell the House the thrust of that advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thrust of that advice was that&mdash;as best I can, I am summarising&mdash;it could possibly be done, but it would be very technical, very complicated, and could involve some difficulties. I, at no stage, have had any preference for going down a path other than the path that we are now going down. It is a very curious notion of politics and it is a very curious notion that an executive, having the authority of the house of parliament which creates the government in the first place, is in some way under a constraint in implementing a policy it was elected on by any lawful means available to it. I say to all of you that I will, with great enthusiasm and great gusto, do everything I can to lawfully implement the policies on which I was elected. I make no apology for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preferable course of action is the course of action that the parliament has been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> invited to go down, and which this House has already gone down. I hope that the Senate will pass the legislation dealing with a one-third sale of Telstra. That would be the neatest, tidiest and best way of doing it. I think the other way is very complicated. It was examined. I make no secret of it. Why shouldn't it be examined? Is there some law against examining ways of keeping your election promises? What are you mob getting up to? You are carrying on as though it is some crime to keep an election promise. We were elected on a commitment to sell one-third of Telstra. We are trying to do that.</PARA>

I recognise that his farmers are experiencing a very rough time and they would be absolutely committed to seeing that we did not waste money in this place. There is a question as to whether taxpayers got value for money from the consultancies engaged under the previous government. I want to draw the House's attention to one of these in particular and let people contemplate what might have gone on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it happens, during the course of the last government the former Minister for Resources, Mr Beddall, under the watchful eye of Senator Collins, was casting his eye around for a good consultant on resources&mdash;someone who knew something about fishing, energy, minerals or forestry, where he plainly needed some very good political, as well as policy, advice. He found one. His name was Mr Brian Courtice. At that time he had been a recent consultant to another minister, Alan Griffiths. Griffo had been the Minister for Resources, but that did not matter; he was wanted in a new role as a consultant in the area of resources. As a consultant to Alan Griffiths he was on an annual salary of $73,300. Over an eight&hyphen;month period he managed to rack up travel of $16,000 and airfares of $23,000&mdash;a total of $91,000 for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1407"> eight months work. I have not seen any of the work; I assume it is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before that, Mr Speaker, it was the case that Mr Courtice had been the member for Hinkler in Queensland. Following that, he became a key consultant to Minister Beddall. Curiously, the consultant's office was based in Bundaberg&mdash;that is, 300 kilometres from the minister's office and also, curiously, in the seat of Hinkler. It is rather interesting, too, that many of the key resource issues needing this level of expertise were to be found in community functions in and around the electorate of Hinkler. And so it goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This wisdom does not come cheaply, either. His salary by that time was well over $74,000 per annum. He managed to rack up another $20,000 in travel and another $32,000 in airfares. He had a personal car in Bundaberg for his own use which was worth $9,200. There was a total for his second period as a consultant to the then Minister for Resources of $161,000&mdash;a total bill of $231,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of questions have to be asked. Where are the reports? Where is the $230,000 worth of value in advice? Where are the great gains to our resources sector? Perhaps they are in the forestry area. If they are not there, perhaps the explanation lies in the fact that Mr Courtice ran as a candidate for the seat of Hinkler at the last election. And for all of that taxpayers' money, here is the interesting point: he not only failed to regain his seat but&mdash;do you know what actually happened?&mdash;the sitting member increased his lead from 300 to 16,000 votes. I would like to finish by making this observation: we will not be re&hyphen;employing Mr Courtice as a consultant.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. I recognise the concern of the member for Menzies&mdash;and, indeed, other members of the House&mdash;about the current situation in Burma. I am sure that I reflect the views of the whole House in saying the government is deeply concerned about events that have taken place recently in Burma and, in particular, the detention of what we believe now to be in the vicinity of 260 members of the National League for Democracy, the political movement which is led by Aung San Suu Kyi.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These arrests represent a significant backward step in Burma, and the Australian embassy in Rangoon has conveyed the Australian government's deep concerns to the Burmese government. Our embassy in Rangoon will be monitoring the situation closely, but I note that the National League for Democracy's party conference is continuing, despite the detention of some 260 of its members, most of whom, by the way, were elected democratically by the people of Burma some years ago.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1409">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This sort of violence and the arbitrary arrest of individuals is no solution to the problems of Burma, and it will only lead to continuing instability in that country. The only way forward for Burma is through negotiation, consultation and discussion, and until that takes place the country will simply suffer from uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say also on the topic of Burma that I know all Australians were delighted that Aung San Suu Kyi received an Order of Australia, which was announced recently by the Governor&hyphen;General. That was in recognition of the work an enormously courageous woman has put into the processes of democracy in Burma. Despite all that has been thrown at her and despite having been detained for a very long period, she has continued to stick by her principles. I probably speak on behalf of 18 million Australians in saying that we are right behind her and the courage she has shown in her pursuit of democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I noted at the end of last week an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>&mdash;normally a highly reputable and accurate newspaper, or sometimes it is anyway&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, today. That editorial was mistaken in characterising the Australian government's policy on Burma as `a policy of constructive engagement', which is, of course, the policy of the ASEAN countries. I know the member for Holt will have a real sense of this, because he was the author of the current Australian government policy on Burma. This government is continuing with this policy because we see it at this stage being the most appropriate way forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be said that the so&hyphen;called benchmark policy is a policy which ensures that there is no bilateral development assistance given directly to the Burmese government. The only development assistance we give is through non&hyphen;government organisations. As far as trade is concerned, the Australian government does not go out and promote trade with Burma; we have an official policy of neither encouraging nor discouraging trade.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, as far as Burma is concerned, we look for outcomes and policy approaches which will encourage the process of democracy and which will encourage Aung San Suu Kyi. This will, we hope, lead to a greater process of liberalisation by the SLORC. The policy of constructive engagement by the ASEAN countries has not led to that, nor I suppose you could argue has our benchmark policy. Nevertheless, we will continue to stand up for appropriate human rights in Burma. We will continue to support the processes of democracy. We will support Aung San Suu Kyi because she has the backing of the overwhelming majority of the people of Burma.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I would like to recognise the cooperation of the government of the People's Republic of China in the return of these people to their homes. Regional cooperation on these matters is essential if we are going to be able to maintain in place an orderly migration arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unauthorised arrival of boat people in Australia is not a new phenomenon. It is possible that there will be further arrivals.

What can the government do to respond to the continuing decline in fund membership?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to the honourable member for his question. I am aware of the figure he talks about; it was released on Friday. Coverage of private health insurance is now at 33.9 per cent of the Australian population. I agree with the former health minister Graham Richardson that when health insurance drops below 40 per cent we have a problem, because it puts extra pressure on the public hospital system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My department estimated last year that a two per cent drop in private health insurance puts the pressure of another 322,000 public hospital bed days onto the public system, or leaves roughly two big city hospitals brimful for 365 days a year. If you want to do something about private health insurance, you have to look at the reasons why people are dropping out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The first of these reasons is price. Roughly two-thirds drop out because of price. That is why we are bringing in incentives for people to take out private health insurance, and that is why they are pitched at the group which are dropping out most heavily, that is, fami lies with kids&mdash;presumably parents who are in their late 30s, early 40s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason for dissatisfaction relates to the gap. Thirteen per cent of people drop out because of that. In spite of legislation passed over a year ago now, there is no health fund in Australia offering a comprehensive policy, because, basically, the doctors would not trust the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hope to make amendments to that legislation so that it will be workable. We are not in any way opposed to the notion of doctors signing contracts with health funds or with hospitals but, if we can get people to sign up, if there can be a bit of goodwill, the public will benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also putting to the medical profession that it is up to them to try to address the issues that drive people mad, such as numerous bills. A year ago my son was admitted to hospital for two days in intensive care. I received 35 bills for that two&hyphen;day admission, and many people are annoyed with similar things. It is up to the medical profession to address that. I certainly challenge them to do it. Our main reason for supporting people having a choice to take out private health insurance is quite simple. Our commitment to private health insurance underpins our commitment to Medicare: one will not work adequately without the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to supplement an answer to a previous question while I am on my feet. I talked previously about Aboriginal health and I thought on the day it was not worth being partisan about it but I cannot let pass a comment from the previous minister for health that the four initiatives that I announced were in some way a ringing endorsement of Labor's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you what Labor's policy on Aboriginal health did. Many would say that the only two countries in the world with indigenous people where health has gone backwards in recent years are the former Soviet Union and Australia. The member for Fremantle is babbling away now that they are your policies. I will go through them one by one. The first is better coordination with states. You could never talk to them. We started from nothing. This has not been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1412"> conceived before. You could never do it even if you wanted to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the information of honourable members, I present a statement of the use of the Advance to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, May 1996. I wish to advise the House that on this occasion the Advance to the Speaker was used to reimburse me for actual out-of-pocket medical expenses associated with treatment of an illness that developed in 1993 whilst I was overseas on official duties. At the time, I was the member of an Australian parliamentary delegation that travelled to Somalia at the invitation of the then Minister for Defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After my claim for medical expenses was rejected by Medicare on the basis that my employer was responsible for meeting the cost of work related illness, I contacted Comcare, seeking reimbursement. However, Comcare advised that it had no authority to pay the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1414"> claim and passed it on to the House of Representatives. After considerable toing&hyphen;and&hyphen;froing, the matter was finally referred to the Attorney-General's Department, which advised that under the circumstances an act of grace payment could be made under section 34A of the Audit Act. In January of this year, the former Minister for Finance approved an act of grace payment. In February, the former Speaker authorised the use of the advance to reimburse me for the costs I had incurred. The whole process took some three years to finalise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it quite clear that my decision to provide the House with this explanation does in no way compromise the privacy of other members who from time to time may find themselves in a similar situation. However, I do want to emphasise the fact that, unlike other public servants, members of parliament are not always covered for cost of treatment of medical conditions that may arise as a result of their official duties. I believe this is both unreasonable and unacceptable and is a matter that should be immediately addressed by the appropriate authorities.</PARA></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT></DEBATE>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> deplores the tragic loss of life and the endangerment of the innocent civilian population as a result of this conflict;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> supports the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425 as part of the settlement.</PARA>
<PARA>Last month all Australians were shocked and appalled by the tragic events in Lebanon. As honourable members will recall, for 16 days each night's television news brought us scenes of conflict and horror as Israel's armed forces launched massive air and artillery attacks in southern Lebanon, an operation codenamed `Grapes of wrath', in response to Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah guerillas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not my intention today to canvass all the rights and wrongs of this episode. Israel has said its actions were defensive and aimed at protecting its northern population centres against repeated rocket attacks. At the same time, however, no-one should be allowed to ignore the horrendous human costs that resulted from Israel's action. More than 170 innocent Lebanese civilians&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;were killed in the bombardment and more than 400 others were injured. More than 100 Lebanese civilians&mdash;refugees seeking safety&mdash;were killed when Israeli <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1419"> artillery shelled the UN peacekeeping camp at Qana.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 200 Lebanese villages were evacuated because of the bombardment and more than 400,000 Lebanese were made refugees&mdash;forced from their homes until the shelling ceased in the early hours of 27 April. There was also extensive damage to Lebanon's electricity supply, blockage of its ports and repeated fire on civilians travelling Lebanon's main coastal road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragic events of last month were, of course, only the latest episode in Lebanon's long history of conflict and long history of suffering&mdash;a history in which Lebanon has all too often been the subject of foreign occupation with flagrant disregard for Lebanese sovereignty and independence. Last month's events also clearly underscored the continuing fragility of the Middle East peace process. The successful efforts of the United States to broker a new cease&hyphen;fire between Israel and the Hezbollah are to be commended and demonstrate the vital role that they have played as a key player in the Middle East peace process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, however, the underlying circumstances in Lebanon remained unchanged, sadly and tragically. Israeli forces and their ally, the South Lebanese Army, continue to occupy southern Lebanon whilst, at the same time, the Iranian backed Hezbollah guerillas remain committed to continuing their fight against Israel and continuing that fight from within the territory of Lebanon. At the same time, Syria continues to maintain an estimated 35,000 troops in Lebanon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against this background, there can be no doubt as to the absolute necessity for all participants in the Middle East peace process to work unremittingly to achieve a just and lasting peace for the region&mdash;a peace which, I put to the House today, must include a fundamental guarantee of the territorial integrity of Lebanon as well as the absolute right of security for the citizens of Israel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that an essential element of any durable peace in the Middle East will be the implementation of resolution 425 of the Security Council. That resolution, adopted <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by the council more than 18 years ago, calls for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the strict respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognised boundaries . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to call on Israel to cease military action in Lebanon and to withdraw its forces from all Lebanese territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that the profile that Lebanon enjoys in the minds of Australians today is greater than any other Arab country. Australians admire Lebanon's rich and ancient history&mdash;a history that has been touched by nearly all of the great civilisations of the past. We have welcomed into our presence in Australia over 400,000 Lebanese people and their descendants. This community has already played an extraordinarily positive role in building and maintaining linkages between Australia and Lebanon. Lebanese Australians have brought with them notable contributions at every level of Australian society&mdash;whether it be business, commerce, politics, education, sport or the arts. They have maintained a tremendous commitment to their adopted homeland whilst also cherishing their cultural and ethnic heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in Australia&mdash;I know I speak for all Australians&mdash;are delighted that this is so, giving such tangible expression to what multiculturalism is all about. In the process, all aspects of Australian life have been enriched, and we as a nation have a special responsibility in return to do all that we can to support respect for Lebanon's sovereignty and for Lebanon's territorial integrity as a fundamental and integral part of the Middle East peace process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1420">  Let me say to the House that our nation is neither a party to the Arab-Israel conflict, nor are we ever likely to play a major diplomatic role in mediation in the Middle East. But we do have important economic, strategic and humanitarian interests in the region. We share the strong global interest, strategically and economically, in the maintenance of stability in the Middle East and, of course, we share with the international community humanitarian concerns about the suffering that war and conflict are bringing upon innocent civil ians&mdash;concerns only too recently reinforced by the appalling events at Qana and elsewhere in southern Lebanon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's interests prompted the federal Labor government to make a significant contribution to the multilateral arm of the Middle East peace process. Australia has a longstanding commitment of Defence Force personnel to the UN Truce Supervision Organisation and, as well, we provide personnel for the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has been an active participant in the Arms Control and Regional Security Working Group. That was the group developed from the 1991 Madrid Middle East Peace Conference as the appropriate forum for negotiating regional arms control measures. We have been able to make this contribution because we have a great deal of positive experience&mdash;positive experience that comes from our own track record of involvement in non&hyphen;proliferation and weapons of mass destruction issues, especially the chemical weapons convention, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the comprehensive test ban treaty issues. Australia has been involved centrally in all of these areas. In addition, we have been able to draw upon our experience, given our leading role in the formation and development of the ASEAN regional security dialogue forum. That is the forum for our own region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say that of the many non-defence issues which are crucial to the stability in the Middle East we have taken a particular interest in that of water security. With its intrinsic importance to the region, and again because of our experience in that field, Australia has been an active contributor to the work of the Middle East Water Resources Working Group, and some very fine work indeed has been done by that group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these activities have made a real contribution to the Middle East peace process, and we can be rightly proud of them. Our involvement in both the arms control and water resources working groups has been universally welcomed and valued by all of the countries of the region. Today, I urge the government to ensure that adequate resources <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are committed, within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and to Australian diplomatic posts in the Middle East, to continue and to build upon these most important activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time it is incumbent upon all of us, as Australian members of parliament, government and opposition, to make sure that we take every opportunity to urge all of the parties to the peace process to respect the sovereignty of Lebanon as an integral and essential element of a just and enduring settlement in the region. In these and many other areas, none is less important than all of us looking for the opportunities that might present themselves in our electoral work to look at the great distress that exists and take whatever measures we can, be it through non&hyphen;government organisations or similar means, to provide assistance of a humanitarian kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today is an important opportunity for us in the Australian parliament to demonstrate our support for efforts to secure peace in the Middle East. On Wednesday, Israel will hold its parliamentary elections and, one way or another, the Middle East peace process will enter a new phase. It is in that context that it is most timely for this parliament today to register our very strong support for all efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. I commend the motion to the House.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1421">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was first elected as a state member of parliament in 1984 I came across the very substantial number of people of Lebanese&mdash;Maronite, Melkite, Orthodox and Muslim&mdash;background in my electorate. I found them all to be very genuine people, for whom I have a lot of time and respect. One of the first things I noticed about the Lebanese is that, rather than asking, `How are you?' they invariably ask, `How is the family?' They feel that if the family is okay you are okay. They are people whom I have come to love. I have spent a lot of time with them over the past 13 years and will continue to do so because these are people who work hard, love their former country and love Australia just as passionately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was aged about 10 or so my uncle took me on a short holiday from Alexandria in Egypt, where I was born, to Lebanon. I remember seeing the city of Beirut and being very impressed with what I saw even at that early age. Lebanon is a very small nation, bordered on the north and east by Syria, on the south by Israel, and by the Mediterranean to the east. It is a very courageous nation which for centuries has been invaded and subjugated by the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Hittites, the Assyrians, the Neo&hyphen;Babylonians, the Crusaders, the Arabs and, for a 600&hyphen;year period, the Turks. Prior to that was invasion by the Romans and Greeks. The Lebanese have had a very tough life, but the little nation of Lebanon has always survived. As the shadow minister said, something in the vicinity of 400,000 Lebanese have migrated to Australia and they have done extremely well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current situation in Lebanon could become very explosive unless people of goodwill sit at the table to resolve this very difficult situation. There have been some 17 years of civil war. I recall that on each and every occasion that we gathered at the invitation of the Australian&hyphen;Lebanese community&mdash;be they Christian or Muslim&mdash;the same two things were said: Lebanon wants to be free of foreign interference in its internal affairs; and all foreign troops should leave Lebanon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, that has not happened. As a result, tensions have continued and have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> heightened at different times, especially during the past 20 or so years. Four basic principles must be adopted. I was pleased that the shadow minister specifically mentioned UN Security Council resolution No. 45 regarding the security of Lebanon. We must remember that not only is Lebanon under threat but Israel as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall visiting Israel with my family some years ago. As we were going around visiting different places we invariably had escorts that used to be around us all the time&mdash;military escorts, armed escorts. Emblazoned in my memory is the sight of a young Israeli soldier who was only about 17, maybe 18, not much older than my eldest son who was with us at the time. I recall looking around and seeing this young man with a machine gun in his hand&mdash;a very big, menacing machine gun. I recall him looking up at the heights, the parapets, and I could see fear in his eyes. Then I saw my son beside him, not much younger, and I thought what a great country we have in Australia. We do not have that threat, as I saw in the eyes of that young Israeli soldier, over us constantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are four basic resolutions that Australia has supported, and will continue to support, regarding the sovereignty of Lebanon. First of all, Israel's security must be ensured. Secondly, the sovereignty of both Israel and Lebanon must be respected. Thirdly, the negotiated settlement must be based on UN Security Council resolution 425 and credible assurances regarding Israel's security. Lastly, not the least of which, a settlement must engage Syria, which bears some responsibility to help end Hezbollah attacks against Israel. Syria has a very strong responsibility to ensure that Hezbollah comes to the negotiating table in a spirit of goodwill and compromise. Unless Hezbollah does that, then the situation will continue to be inflamed in that part of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to look at the situation regarding the terrific cost that has to be borne by Lebanon for the recent shelling that has occurred and the damage that has done to the economy of Lebanon. Some estimates put it as high as $500 million. That is something the Lebanese people themselves cannot carry. We <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1422"> need to look at doing all we can to provide not only moral support but also financial support. I am pleased to see that Australia has made a modest contribution towards the cost of that rebuilding. The Australian embassy in Beirut will be exploring with the Lebanese government and the business community how Australia can assist in the reconstruction process which is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Middle East faces a very explosive situation there unless the people come to the table in goodwill, sit down and negotiate a settlement that is not just a verbal settlement, as has occurred in the past, which has not worked, but a written agreement that would be binding on all parties and that will hopefully build for the future a safe Lebanon, a safe Israel and peace in the Middle East.</PARA></SPEECH>

I think I am the only member of the House of Representatives of Lebanese descent. It is with a heavy heart that I have to rise to speak to this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had three visits to Lebanon. My first visit was in August-September 1987 as a private citizen. That was towards the end of that horrific civil war. My second visit to Lebanon was as part of a parliamentary delegation to the Middle East. We visited Syria, Lebanon, Tunisia and Morocco. That was in December 1993, and we provided a report to the parliament. My third visit to Lebanon was in July last year when I was privileged to return to witness the reopening of the Australian embassy in Beirut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On each of those three occasions I was able to witness a fragile peace, a developing nation coming out of what was a horrific civil war, and a people that were looking to the future. Australia showed its confidence by re-establishing the embassy in Beirut. Last July there was great hope. There were some 400 to 500 people celebrating the reopening of the embassy in Beirut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that Australia is warmly regarded in the Middle East. That dates back to the First and Second World Wars when Australians fought and helped the liberation of Damascus. It also arises out of the strong <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> migration that has taken place for over 130 years from the Middle East to Australia. During the period of the civil war, many people in Australia were sending money to their relatives in Lebanon. There are over 200,000 people of Lebanese descent or Lebanese born people living in Australia. So the bonds were and are still very strong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was quite devastating to see the ferocity of what was occurring in the south of Lebanon. The ferocity extended to Beirut itself. One cannot help but feel for the Lebanese people who, I think it is fair to say, appear to be pawns in a much wider game. There was an interesting article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Washington Post</EMPHASIS> which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guardian Weekly</EMPHASIS> on 28 April 1996. It says in part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many explanations of why the violence burst out of its confinement in the security zone: Hezbollah's growing boldness, Iran's strategic aims, Syria's ire at a diplomatic freeze, Israel's election&hyphen;year ambitions and fears. Underlying all of them was the instability of the security zone itself, where Israel was in danger of losing its grip.</PARA>
<PARA>None of those have anything to do with the people of Lebanon. Another section of the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many Lebanese, even those unsympathetic to Hezbollah's call for strict Islamic rule, regard armed resistance as justified until Israel departs.</PARA>
<PARA>The truth is&mdash;and the information we were given on our parliamentary delegation&mdash;that Hezbollah enjoys very little support in Lebanon. The only support it derives is as a result of the Israeli occupation of the southern zone. The information we were given was that, if Israel were to leave, the support for Hezbollah would dissipate very quickly. Another section of the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most analysts agree that while Peres had something to gain from Operation Grapes of Wrath, he had more to lose if he failed to respond to Hezbollah's escalation.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not stand here blaming Israel, Hezbollah or Syria alone. This is a complicated problem. But what people of Lebanese descent want&mdash;I think what everyone wants&mdash;is for this thing to stop and for the Middle East peace process to get back on the rails. It is imperative for a secure world for there to be just and lasting peace in Lebanon, in Syria, in Israel&mdash;in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1423"> whole of the Middle East region. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) on the moving of this motion. I particularly feel that this House is richer for having members such as the member for Banks (Mr Melham) who are direct descendants from places such as these. It is through such members that the rest of us are helped to understand and empathise with some of the issues which affect other areas in the world, particularly war&hyphen;torn areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is home to over 100,000 persons of Lebanese descent. The Lebanese have made a significant contribution to Australia, whether it be in small business or in establishing trade links with the Middle Eastern region. Yet Australia's Lebanese community has had to endure the harsh reality of their homeland ravished by war&mdash;of seeing Beirut, once the cultural and economic powerhouse of the Mediterranean, become the scene of the most divisive and bloody of civil wars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lebanese in Australia have relatives who have been affected by this war. For this reason, the Australian government has a responsibility to do everything in its power to encourage and facilitate the peace process in the Middle East. It is important that Lebanon be given a chance to prosper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragic incident at Qana has no doubt been a setback for the Middle Eastern peace process but is one which must not mark the end of hope for achieving peace in southern Lebanon. The peace process must continue and Lebanon must be assisted by the international community in rebuilding those areas affected by recent hostilities. It is a matter of not just the financial cost, as the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) has indicated&mdash;the $500 million&mdash;but also the more tragic loss of innocent human lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government has demonstrated a real commitment to the Lebanese people. The reopened Australian embassy plans to examine just how Australia can contribute to the reconstruction process. With Australia now having a lot of expertise in drylands agriculture and water projects, we have the chance over the next few years of making a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lasting contribution to the physical wellbeing of Lebanon and other nearby countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Qana incident is indicative of the degree to which the people of Lebanon have suffered over the years. The tragic bombing of the UN compound also cost the lives of Fijian United Nations peacekeepers&mdash;men committed to assisting the Lebanese people in the process of rebuilding their nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such tragic events ought not lead us to neglect Israel's right to protect its borders and, above all, protect its people from the danger of attacks, both within and without Israel. No less tragic to the Qana incident have been the terrorist attacks on innocent Israeli citizens. By the end of 1995, over 100 Israelis had been killed by Hamas attacks. To date in 1996, a further 63 have been killed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Attacks from Lebanese based Hezbollah terrorist groups are a real and constant threat to Israel. Hezbollah is a radical Shiah group, backed by Iran, which is anti-Israeli and  anti-Western. Its reason for existence is the removal of all non-Islamic influences from the area&mdash;a notion which is threatening not only to Jewish Israelis but also to Christian Lebanese.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more cynical political commentators have suggested that Israel's recent hardline stance against terrorists, a stance which tragically led to the Qana incident, has more to do with Israel's election campaign than real political concerns. I believe that all Israelis, whether they be supporters of the conservative Likud party or Mr Shimon Peres's Labor Party, would demand that Israel must be protected from terrorist organisations which are out to destroy not just the peace process but also Israel itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally hope that it will be in the interests of all Lebanese if, whoever wins the Israeli elections, the peace process set in motion by Yitzhak Rabin continues. If terrorist organisations in Lebanon or Israel are allowed to derail the process, Mr Rabin's death will become meaningless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion's part (3)(b) is of great importance. Any settlement of the problems in the Middle East must protect the security of the Israeli people in a peace agreement between <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1424"> Lebanon and Israel. I believe it is fair to say that Syria must take some of the responsibility, particularly in exerting its influence over the Hezbollah and terrorist organisations, in bringing about a peaceful conclusion to the conflict.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to support the motion moved in this House this afternoon by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). I think it is important to restate the motion. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Australian Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> declares its support for world efforts to secure peace in the Middle East through a settlement of the present conflict between the Hezbollah and Israel in Southern Lebanon;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> deplores the tragic loss of life and the endangerment of the innocent civilian population as a result of this conflict;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is of the view that a settlement must involve the Governments of Lebanon, Syria and Israel and be based on the following guarantees:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the territorial integrity of Lebanon and all countries in the region; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the absolute right of security for the citizens of Israel; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> supports the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425 as part of the settlement.</PARA>
<PARA>I have been a member of this parliament for some 17 years now. There has not been a month or two that has gone by when I have not risen in this parliament to speak on the issue of Lebanon. The war in the southern part of Lebanon in particular has been going on for nearly 20 years, and many of the people who have come as migrants to Australia have come because they wanted to leave that war&hyphen;torn area and settle in a country where there is peace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very unfortunate thing when people have to leave their homes, their neighbours and, in many instances, their families because of what has occurred in the south of Lebanon, that is, an invasion by a foreign country, to wit Israel, and in the western part of the country by Syria in the Bekaa Valley region. Over recent years the government of Lebanon has, in effect, ruled nothing. Until recently, the country has been ripped apart by militias and foreign troops. I think we should be very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> careful in Australia's response to the crisis settlement in the Middle East that we do not see Lebanon become a casualty of a resolution of Israel's problems with its neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be too easy for the Americans, the French or whoever else wishes to broker a peace agreement between Israel and Syria to say that part of that brokering would be that the Syrians still have effective economic and political control over a great part of Lebanon and that the Israelis would still maintain some sort of security zone in the south. People would say that the question of the Hezbollah and Israel is a chicken and egg issue and whose point of view it is depends upon where the chicken and the egg started.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that over the years thousands of people have been killed. The Shi'ite population of south Lebanon have been tarred with a brush as alleged terrorists by international commentators. That allegation is not so. Most of those people have been fighting for their own lives and for their villages and have supported the Hezbollah because they were the only ones who, in some instances, took up the fight for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The group that we should be giving more consideration to is the Amal movement in south Lebanon. Nabih Berri and his people in that organisation are moderates and all they say is that Lebanon should be there for the Lebanese. A settlement of the Middle East question must involve Lebanon being satisfactorily dealt with and the only satisfactory way that Lebanon can be dealt with is that all the foreign troops should be out&mdash;the 35,000 Syrians and the thousands of people that the Israelis support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lebanon should be able to have free and fair elections so that Lebanon can then return to what it was 25 years ago, namely, the jewel of the Middle East, a country that people flock to and a country that should be reconstructed in that way. I think that this parliament and members on both sides should stress that Lebanon should not become the last casualty of the Middle East peace settlement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion, having spent three hours last night with the parish of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1425"> Our Lady of Lebanon in my electorate at what was a most inspiring gathering where the young people of that parish had presided over a budget of $250,000 to build a new youth centre for the parish. One of the young builders in the congregation had actually built the centre and the young people had raised $30,000 to complete that facility. It was a statement of what a group of motivated young Australians can do and a lesson from the Lebanese community to the rest of us in Australia about investing back in our communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aspirations of that Lebanese community in Parramatta are similar to those of the rest of us in Australia and throughout the world in relation to peace. It is one of the most fundamental aspirations of the human spirit but it can be very costly to achieve. One cannot help but wonder what we, at this distance, can hope to achieve through a motion such as this, in agreement as I am with all four of its principal propositions. At times I wonder whether we are merely adding to the verbiage, adding to the sheet upon sheet of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, and wondering in our hearts, on both sides, about the depth of our commitment to peace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been noted to me that one of the greatest problems we have in this city of Canberra is a kind of tribal mentality, an unforgiving factionalism, a political culture with long memories in which many of our acts are motivated by revenge rather than by a desire to achieve peace. I suspect that we in this place ought to examine our own culture before setting ourselves up too highly on matters concerning peace in the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is something to which the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) rightly referred in saying that we have a contribution to make. I note the motion refers to UN Security Council resolution 425, which was passed some 18 years ago, and here we are today supporting this motion when so little progress seems to have been made. We must ask: what can we say, what do we have to offer, what words are worth anything more than the paper they are written on in that regard?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Middle East is really the cradle of civilisation. It has thrown up the greatest <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leaders known to civilisation. A figure like Moses, who the Muslims would recognise as a divine messenger, a prophet with a new revelation, is likewise looked to with reverence by Christians and Jews as a patriarch of their faith. Seemingly, there are still elements which are held in common by all the parties which are having such enormous difficulty achieving cohesion and peace at present. They all share a belief in a monotheistic god.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel that we owe a great debt to the region. When we see what has happened in South Africa and in the former Soviet Union, when we see such inspiring examples of those who have transcended their histories, their factionalism, their tribal differences, I am optimistic about the prospects in the Middle East. I join with honourable members who have spoken previously about the need for respect for territorial integrity and for diverse religious cultures. Whatever peace is achieved ought not be a peace of the strong over the weak. Lebanon must be a part of any enduring peace settlement. If peace is to be enduring, it has to be a genuine expression of the will and hearts of the people. It will not be achieved by posturing or pre-election manoeuvring. We have to hope and pray that it is a growing, generalised aspiration of the people of the Middle East. We join with them as a statement of solidarity that&mdash;in spite of our distance&mdash;that situation is of considerable importance to us. We join with all those who seek peace. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in support of the motion moved in the House today by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). I commend him for that motion and I commend the honourable members for Watson (Mr McLeay) and Banks (Mr Melham) on their contributions. I suggest the value of the Parliamentary Library Research Service to the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is widely recognised that Israel's conduct within southern Lebanon constitutes a gross overreaction to assaults from Hezbollah. But we should not lose sight of the fact that Hezbollah is financed by Iranian sources and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1426"> effectively operates as a bargaining chip under the de facto control of Syria. Nonetheless, the real momentum for Hezbollah's assault comes from the continued Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and issues such as the diversion of water resources from the El Litani river in southern Lebanon and similar matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need look no further than the bombing of the United Nations shelter at Qana and the death of over 100 civilians and United Nations peacekeepers, the destruction of power stations, and such atrocities as the destruction of the ambulance carrying injured civilians because it was a so-called Hezbollah ambulance. All of these incidents deserve the strongest condemnation of the House. But we need not ignore the attacks that have produced these outrages, because Hezbollah and those who support them are equally culpable for what they are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is tragic that, just at a time when finally some form of fragile peace is starting to emerge in the Middle East and finally Israel is starting to give some form of remedy for the injustices that it has meted out to the Palestinian people over many years, these sorts of outrages should be occurring on both sides. The peace process in the Middle East should be allowed to work, and I am sure that we in this House all support that process and hope that it will work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend to honourable members a very good article written on this issue by Martin Woolacott in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guardian Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 13 April 1996. In that article Mr Woolacott runs through the basic problem in the Middle East: how violence has become the only universal language and how people on all sides&mdash;Israelis, Syrians, some of the groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas&mdash;are effectively using violence as a political weapon to bolster their own authority with respect to their constituencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important issue lurking behind the current situation, which was adverted to by the member for Watson, and which I would like to refer to in the brief moments available to me, is the future of Lebanon. The period after the conclusion of the civil war in Lebanon under the Taif accords has been followed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by effective Syrian hegemony in Lebanon, a regime that is dominated by Syria, with roughly 35,000 troops from Syria stationed in Lebanon. There are substantial question marks over the legitimacy of the Lebanese government. Elections were subject to widespread mass boycotts. Recent presidential elections that were due have been scrapped and the term of President Hrawi has been extended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is widely rumoured that the parliamentary elections that are due in September this year will also be similarly postponed. Many Lebanese from across the denominational and sectarian spectrum do not regard the government as legitimate. There is a serious risk that Lebanon will effectively become a pawn in the negotiations with respect to future Middle East peace arrangements and that, because of the Syrian dominance of Lebanon at the moment, it will potentially be condemned to indefinite foreign control or some of its existing resources will be traded away: for example, water rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad thing is that this sort of arrangement could very well suit Israel. Lebanon is probably the major potential competitor with Israel with respect to its economic future in the Middle East. It is westernised, highly skilled, multicultural and has some sort of democratic traditions. If it is under some sort of authoritarian rule, if it is fragmented, if it continues in the situation that it is in, its potential economic threat to Israel is much less. I am disturbed to see recent threats in that regard made by the Israeli Deputy Minister of Defence, Mr Ori Orr.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, Australia should be pressing for the implementation of not only UN Security Council resolution 425 but also resolution 520, which calls for `the strict respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the government of Lebanon'. Removal of Syrian troops from Lebanon is not the first nor the most important step for Middle East peace, but it must be not be forgotten that it is an important part of achieving a just and comprehensive and overall solution to the Middle East situation. We must not allow broader geopolitical considerations to push the integrity <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1427"> and independence of Lebanon and the future for the Lebanese people off the agenda. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my first address to this House since becoming the member for McMillan, rather than the member for the former seat of Corinella, I did not think I would find myself standing here supporting a motion moved by the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), with whom I have little in common, supported by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), with whom I have less in common, and further supported by the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), with whom I have little in common, and by the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), with whom I have nothing in common.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a reflection of this House and this parliament that we are representatives of the community we serve. Part of the community we serve, as pointed out by the member for Kingsford-Smith, is made up of 400,000 Lebanese, all with a heart for this country and concerns and a heart for their own. It is appropriate for us to address in this parliament, on the other side of the world from where these conflicts take place, but where our television screens flash to us, the ghastly pictures that we see of what can happen with one smart bomb in one small area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this country we fall over if we have a major bus smash. We have had the tragedy in Port Arthur that stopped a nation. We can remember back to Cyclone Tracy, which stopped the country for six months. Yet these people have had to put up with this sort of tragedy for a long time. There have been a number of programs on Australian television over the weekend, probably in the build up to the elections, as pointed out by the member for Kingsford-Smith, that will be held in Israel this week. One of the lines that was used was, `The dust of the Middle East is old and has seen a lot of blood.' I dwelt on that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and thought that we in Australia will be here in Canberra on the other side of the world with one member of this House, the member for Banks, with Lebanese blood running through his veins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My only investment in the people of Lebanon is that as a former retailer&mdash;probably the only one in this House at the moment; I am not sure&mdash;I have dealt with these people and found out that they are not only good business people, they are excellent business people and they have contributed enormously to this nation. Why? Because our concern is a direct one. Our concern is that the overarching peace process must continue whether it is between Israel and Syria or the others mentioned by the member for Melbourne and that we are to bring peace through with the other smaller players that are intent on disrupting the process itself at any cost. What we can do from a distance is say, `Yes, we are here in Australia and we actually do care.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, by the good grace of this parliament, I was lucky to be taken on a delegation to the Middle East at the end of 1992. We visited Iran, Jordan, Egypt and Israel. I was exposed for the first time to the realities of what the Middle East is&mdash;not reading it in a library document, not hearing about it from a speech in this House, not reading it in a paper or seeing it on television, but experiencing what those people feel in those nations in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not been to Lebanon, described as the jewel of the Middle East. What I heard from the member for Banks this morning in a previous conversation is that these people have the ability to rebuild and rebuild themselves. What we can do in this nation on behalf of this whole Middle East process is continue with our efforts as best we can and encourage these people to stay there and be part of the process, as we are part of the process, as best we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not give up in this House on behalf of the people who live in this country. We stand with them on this day and say, `If there is a process where this parliament can help this Middle East peace process to its conclusion, we will be there.' We will stand with those people and every effort, as has been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1428"> outlined by the speeches today, will be made and hopefully accepted in a bipartisan way, as it has been today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over recent years we have all witnessed the very considerable courage that has been shown by a number of leaders of both Israel and various Arab communities in starting the peace process. Some considerable time ago we saw peace between Israel and Egypt, followed up somewhat later by peace between Jordan and Israel. In more recent times we were all moved by the handshake between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat. In more recent times we have seen very considerable progress made in the settlement of the political status of the Palestinian people in relation to the West Bank and Gaza. We have also seen the considerable strides made by the Palestinian authorities in relation to the amendments of their charter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those points of courage need to be congratulated, but they need to be built on. They need to be built on by a vision of the future of the Middle East. In that respect, I commend to the House a book written a few years ago by the current Israeli Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The New Middle East</EMPHASIS>. Shimon Peres outlines his vision of a Middle East as a peaceful, developing, economically cooperating area for the benefit of all the people of that region. He says, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the Middle East at a turning point in history, it is time to seek a different "solution . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about a different solution in the sense of a non-military answer of a non&hyphen;military solution because a military solution is, frankly, not possible. We now need to see a rekindling of the peace process in a way which produces a settlement with Syria on the difficult issue of the Golan Heights. This motion before the House today of the shadow spokesman on foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), very much deals with a settlement in relation to Lebanon, which is based on the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Lebanon. If it is to be durable, that peace process needs to reflect that Israel's security has to be ensured. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The sovereignty of nations in the area needs to be respected and any settlement has to engage Syria, which does bear some responsibility to help prevent Hezbollah attacks against Israel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said all that, I want to refer to a lead article that appeared in the respected <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist </EMPHASIS>magazine on 20 April. It directly relates to the more recent events which have occurred in Lebanon. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Israel has the right, and indeed the duty, to protect its people . . . But neither the protection of its citizens in northern Galilee, nor the hope of a comprehensive Middle Eastern peace, justifies the forcible displacement of up to half a million inoffensive Lebanese, and the savaging of their homes and livelihoods.</PARA>
<PARA>What is required is a sense of proportion. Shimon Peres, in the book that I referred to earlier, certainly clearly understands that because he said the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prolongation of the Arab&hyphen;Israeli conflict has inevitably led to the continued misery of millions. In frustration, many of these people have turned to mysticism and otherworldliness, have rejected the modernist state, and have immersed themselves in religious fundamentalism.</PARA>
<PARA>Press reports make it clear that Hezbollah support in the community there essentially arises from its role as a resistance movement and, once the issues in dispute principally between Israel and Syria are resolved, the expectation is that the future Hezbollah&mdash;along with the other militias that have already been dissolved and absorbed into the Lebanese national army&mdash;ought to also be quite capable of being resolved in a way which ensures the security of Israel but respects the legitimate rights of the people of Lebanon to their territorial integrity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As other speakers have said, Lebanon is a jewel. It has been in the past a powerhouse for the economic development of the Middle East; it ought to have that opportunity again. Before the recent outbreak of troubles there, the economic projections for Lebanon were growth rates of eight per cent per annum up until the next century. Those sorts of growth rates would transform it in the sorts of ways Shimon Peres envisaged in his book. There would be great opportunities for cooperation and economic development, including, I might <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1429"> say, the economic development of Syria. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

The measure of agreement and the measure of universal concern that has been expressed for the future of Lebanon and for the people of Lebanon is entirely appropriate coming from the Australian Parliament which, as we have said here this afternoon, represents several hundred thousand people either born in Lebanon or of Lebanese descent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I say that I am thankful to the members for Lowe (Mr Zammit), Banks (Mr Melham), Deakin (Mr Barresi), Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), Melbourne (Mr Tanner), McMillan (Mr Broadbent) and Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) for their participation in the debate this afternoon. When the member for Banks spoke from his personal knowledge of Lebanon, of his three visits there, and with the experience of someone who is of Lebanese descent, you could not help but be moved. He has very well illustrated to the House the ferocity of the conflict and the enormous damage that has been done and that he has witnessed with his own eyes. But he also spoke of the great spirit that will be able to rebuild the nation, provided we can guarantee its sovereignty and territorial independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is, as the member for Watson said, the Lebanon has always stood a real risk of being a casualty in the Middle East peace process&mdash;being, as it were, the expendable chip. But the purpose of this motion this afternoon, and the unanimous support that has been given to it, is indicative of the fact that the Australian Parliament believes that fundamental to Middle East peace is the guarantee of the sovereignty of the state of Lebanon and respect by all of the parties for the territorial boundaries and the territorial independence of the nation of the Lebanon. There is no doubt that everyone today supports the concept of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a Lebanon for the Lebanese&mdash;indeed, a multi&hyphen;religious sovereign nation, one that is respected by all&mdash;and, of course, we have a very special responsibility on all of us to be advocating that at every opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will say something about the comments of the member for Parramatta here this afternoon because he raised a number of questions. He asked what could really be achieved; were we just adding verbiage, were these just words. I think it is fair to ask the questions but, of course, there is a great deal we can do. First of all, we can speak out fulsomely in support of the right course of action for Lebanon. Secondly, we can make sure that our voices are heard here in the parliament. It is not just a matter of telling our constituents that we think the Lebanese have had a bad go; it is a matter of us taking that view out to the wider world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I acknowledged in speaking to the motion, we are not central players in the settlement of the Middle East peace process, but we can and must ensure that our voices are heard and that we influence our friends, those who are parties to the settlement of the Middle East peace process, to the maximum extent possible. I think this is terribly important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is equally important, I think, that the government ensure that in those areas that I indicated where we are doing valuable work through the United Nations&mdash;and it is very valuable work: the work of the arms control group and the water resources working group has been widely welcomed by all countries in the region&mdash;that the effort is maintained. With government cutbacks in the forthcoming budget it would be very easy for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to say that these are expendable areas of discretionary commitment. It will be a real test to continue to ensure we put the resources into those terribly important efforts. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired) </EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today is the decision by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corporation to close their branches at Budgewoi in my electorate. The Commonwealth Bank is scheduled to close on 31 May 1996 and Westpac on 21 June 1996. Earlier today the Clerk of the House presented petitions I had lodged from some 737 petitioners from my electorate requesting that the House call on the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to maintain its existing services at Budgewoi.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I present also, in a form that you will not accept&mdash;and nor will the House&mdash;a further 655 signatures to petitions. I am going to walk from this desk a little later to the Acting Clerk of the House and hand it to him. Undoubtedly, he will say to me, `These are not in a form acceptable to the House.' I will still present them to him. I want the parliament to note that there are almost twice as many people&mdash;there are 1,392 people&mdash;who are gravely dissatisfied with the actions of the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac Banking Corporation. One way or another, we will get this information through the House, possibly with the help of the Minister for Industrial Relations and Leader of the House (Mr Reith), to the minister responsible and to the banks to try to reverse those decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when banks are making record profits and senior executives of banks are being paid obscene levels of salary, they have now descended to the stage where they are going around branch by branch picking them off in areas that have long supported both those banks, particularly in the case of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth Bank. Both Westpac, under its former names, and the Commonwealth Bank lived for decades off the miserable amounts they paid to savings bank depositors&mdash;1&frac14; per cent&mdash;moneys that were lent out subsequently at eight, 10, 12, 15, or 20 per cent rates of interest to borrowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have lived and waxed fat for years off these people who now in their later years of life find it extremely difficult to change banking practices and banking means. Now, when these people need the assistance of the banks to help them with their monetary matters, the banks say, `Sorry, we are not making a profit at your branch. Not enough money is being lent at the branch at which you do business and we are closing up shop. You will be able to transfer to other branches or use some of the other electronic means that are available.' Try teaching an 82&hyphen;year&hyphen;old person with limited sight how to use an automatic teller machine. Try showing them how to fill in a new form in a new banking system or getting them to change the practice that they have where they are used to people looking after their affairs and knowing their problems and needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the news came through that the Commonwealth Bank wanted to close its branch at Budgewoi, my constituents Ms Gail Staines and Ms Julie Buffon, and 82&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Mrs Jean Black, met with me to discuss the closure of the Commonwealth Bank at Budgewoi and the implications of that. They determined to gather signatures to the petitions that were tabled earlier, in addition to those signatures that they had already started gathering before I was able to get them a proper format that I requested be passed on to the appropriate minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To compound the damage being brought to Budgewoi and its residents, it was only two weeks later that Westpac announced that they would close their Budgewoi branch. They rang me and spoke to me about it. They said, `Look, we have been  considering this for some time. We have had to bring our decision forward to close our branch too because the Commonwealth is going to close their branch and it would be most unsatisfactory if the Commonwealth Bank closed their branch and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1431"> their customers transferred to us only to find that we were also closing our branch.' So, rather than doubly discomforting customers and my constituents, they decided to bring forward their date of closure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where low income earners will be hit hardest by the closure of the Commonwealth and Westpac banks. Claims by the banks that most transactions can be made from post offices or automatic teller machines fail to acknowledge that many isolated people in Budgewoi will find it difficult because of the public transport available to access the full range of banking services elsewhere. While the banks argue, as I have said, that you can use electronic means, that is just not possible or practical for people in the higher age group who are used to doing things a certain way and only consider doing them that way. It is not fair to those people who need personalised banking services for the banks to walk away from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Banks claim that business has declined and that there are not enough loans being written. My constituents are those people, as I said, who have propped up the profits of these banks in their earlier years with that cheap money that the banks used and which the banks paid them 1&frac14; per cent for. Westpac's decision to close its Budgewoi branch will create fresh hardships in addition to the Commonwealth Bank's decision to close its branch. Both banks are determined, it seems, to ignore the difficulties that their closures will create for those people who need their services most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system used to be that banks averaged their costs, returns and earnings across branches so a network of services was provided. Now we have the situation where banks are making record profits and paying obscene salaries to their senior executives and where each branch is considered on a branch by branch basis. It is no longer a complex of community service obligations. The reaction in Budgewoi was all the worse because, on the day that Westpac made it known that they were pulling out of Budgewoi, the chief executive of Westpac was telling Australia that they were on course for a billion dollar <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> profit. So bye&hyphen;bye to Budgewoi banking services for the aged and loyal customers of Westpac: we are well on our way to a billion dollar profit this year for Westpac across Australia. I find it distasteful that that kind of event could take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reaction that has taken place since then, along with our petitions and meeting with constituents, has been people getting together themselves and arranging a public meeting at Budgewoi at the Halekulani Bowling Club this Wednesday evening at 7.30 p.m. Unfortunately, as the House is sitting I cannot get to that meeting. They are having a public meeting for all the residents in the area to protest at what these banks are doing. It is not just a matter of me saying that here. Mr Ron Connell, the Senior Vice&hyphen;President of the Halekulani Bowling Club, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here we have a government promising to look after small business yet they allow the banks to drive those small businesses to the wall . . . and if these two banks go, there will be a lot of pensioners who will go elsewhere to get their money and shop elsewhere. They're going to shoot down 30 or 40 businesses and their employees.'</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is now the great worry of the business people in Budgewoi: if you pull out those banks, you pull out the underpinning of services to that small business community. Not only do the residents lose the service but also the business people stand the risk of seeing their businesses damaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That letter was from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Central Coast Express Advocate</EMPHASIS> of 17 May 1996. In the same newspaper of the same date, another constituent of mine, Mr L Wilson of Noraville, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision by the Commonwealth Bank to close its Budgewoi branch shows a total lack of regard for customers.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of Budgewoi's residents are pensioners, dependent upon the local branch and Toukley and Lake Haven branches are over capacity now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Bank once prided itself on the slogan: the bank with branches everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA>I strongly endorse the comments of Mr Wilson. We have to get the message across to banks that they are more than just cherry picking in the finance or banking worlds, that they do have a wider obligation to provide a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1432"> service to the community. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I wrote to the Chairman of the Westpac Banking Corporation, John Uhrig, on 21 May asking that the bank continue its services. I have not had a response from him yet. On 1 May I wrote to the chief general manager of the North Metropolitan branch of the Commonwealth Bank also requesting the Commonwealth Bank to continue its services. I have received no response. Twenty&hyphen;six days have elapsed, which is a reasonable time in which to have a response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken with business people in Budgewoi and with Mr Ron Nash of Paul Finnimores Pharmacy. I feel for these people. These business people, our constituents and our community need a continuation of these services. People in higher age groups cannot readily change to complicated banking procedures. I seek in this grievance debate the support of this parliament for the petitions that were tabled earlier and for the request that I have made, and continue to make through the parliament now, that Westpac Banking Corporation and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia each continue to provide a range of banking services to the residents of Budgewoi and recognise that people in higher age groups cannot readily adapt to changes in the banking procedures or adapt to the use of electronic banking machines that younger people can readily embrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seek the support of members on both sides of the House to try to ensure that an adequate network of banking and financial services is maintained to all of our communities, as has been the case for many, many decades.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve today for Anna Wood. The tragic death of 15-year-old Anna in October last year is a subject of an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian  Magazine</EMPHASIS>  of this last weekend. The very beautiful face of this young girl adorns the cover of that magazine. The article is actually an edited extract from a story about Anna by Bronwyn Donaghy. It paints a picture of a society which obviously has some serious problems. If the story is in any respect typical of what is going on amongst younger teenagers, it would appear that we as a society have in many ways very badly let them down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend in this short speech to add to the speculation about Anna's life or the exact circumstances surrounding her death. The circumstances are fairly well known. She died from taking an ecstasy tablet she purchased at a party at a friend's home. In this short speech, I would like to make a short contribution to the celebration of the apparent happiness of Anna's short life. She died when she was only 15 years old.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My wife and I were reading this article over the weekend. It occurred to both of us that every parent should either read this article in the magazine or read the book that has been written by Bronwyn Donaghy. One of Anna's young friends, who I suppose would be 14 or 15 years old, is quoted in this article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past year I've tried cigarettes, drinks, dope, speed, ecstasy and tripping, which is when you use LSD.</PARA>
<PARA>Does that sound like a typical 14&hyphen; or 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;old? I hope not, but I wonder. Another one of Anna's friends, Alexia&mdash;these are not necessarily their real names, as the article points out&mdash;says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Year Seven we smoked to be cool. Then we tried marijuana, but we didn't like it much. By the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1433"> time we were in Year Nine we couldn't stop smoking cigarettes. We were hooked.</PARA>
<PARA>Is this real? Are these kids who are talking in this article typical of kids in a middle class area in the northern beaches of Sydney, going to what is, as far as I can understand it, a pretty good school? There are a number of warnings for parents in this article, and that is why I think the article should be read by all parents. Anna's dad is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can't choose their friends for them and you can't tell your kids they can't go out, not when they get older.</PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about Anna, who was only 15 when she died. I wonder how long they had had that problem for. I do not want to comment on that proposition, but I think the statement that Anna's dad makes here raises lots of questions for parents about the extent to which we do intervene and, when we do intervene, at what stage of our children's lives we intervene to guide them in respect of their friends and in controlling their activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mother of Kathy&mdash;Kathy is another one of Anna's friends&mdash;is called Anne in the article and she subscribes to the belief that today's parents indulge their children to compensate for the attention they are not providing. Why are parents not paying attention to their children? That is a crucial question which needs to be examined carefully. Maybe it is because of the pressures to achieve material success which means both parents have to go out and work when their children are young. Maybe it is the pressure placed on women in particular to place their children in institutional child care and go out to work outside the home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is that children need love, attention and supervision. They cannot get too much of it. All of our efforts in government should be directed to reversing the social engineering which has been occurring for too many years now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ironically, the story about Anna has been told at a time when the Victorian government is considering the decriminalisation of marijuana, as advocated by the Penington report. Some of the recommendations in this report include:  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.1<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Use and possession of a small quantity of marijuana should no longer be an offence. `Small quantity' should be defined as no more than 25 grams . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.2<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Cultivation of up to five cannabis plants per household for personal use should no longer be an offence. `Household' should be defined to exclude everything other than private residences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.3<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Sale of marijuana should remain an offence. Sale of small quantities by an adult to an adult should incur a caution delivered by Victoria Police for a first offence and an adjourned bond for a second offence.</PARA>
<PARA>Another one of the recommendations states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provisions of the Summary Offences Act 1966 should be reviewed to ensure offensive behaviour under the influence of marijuana can be dealt with by police. Similarly, local government should establish bylaws that restrict consumption in public places.</PARA>
<PARA>I can only imagine that local councils would be horrified to be lumbered with that particular responsibility. They have signs up all over the place now saying `No skateboarding', `No cycling'. I guess the next thing to be added will be `No marijuana smoking'. Goodness knows how they are meant to police these laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand why Premier Kennett has not ruled out unequivocally this particular proposal. On his own admission, 97 per cent of submissions to his office have been opposed to the decriminalisation of marijuana. The argument apparently is that prohibition has not worked. Apparently the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and some of his medical colleagues actually support Mr Kennett's view on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is crazy stuff. In the context of reading what happened to Anna Wood and how her young friends, 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, were introduced to the drug scene first by smoking cigarettes&mdash;as if that is not a big enough problem for our society&mdash;then marijuana and so on down the line, we are heading down a very dangerous track. By allowing marijuana to be trivialised, we would be giving permission for young people to act as they wish about this drug.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1434"> The claim that cannabis is safer than alcohol, a claim that is sometimes made in de fence of decriminalisation, is dangerously misleading. Cannabis remains in the body much longer than alcohol does. In fact it remains there for some months and it can certainly affect behaviour, as tests have shown many hours later. The tar content in a cannabis cigarette is 12 times higher than in a tobacco cigarette. The toxicity of cannabis is well established. Cannabis leads to impaired judgment. It causes bronchitis and the risk of lung cancer is much greater than with tobacco smoking. It is undoubtedly a gateway to other dangerous drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely at a time when we are grappling with the huge family and health destroying problems caused by alcohol abuse and with the huge health bill for tobacco abuse, you would think the decriminalisation of marijuana was not even being considered remotely seriously. It concerns me that apparently it is being considered seriously. I want to read into the record again what Anna's friend Chloe, who is 14 or 15 years old, said to make sure I make the point. Chloe said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past year I've tried cigarettes, drinks, dope, speed, ecstasy and tripping, which is when you use LSD.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely our kids deserve better than a society which condones the use and, ultimately&mdash;perhaps even implicitly&mdash;the abuse of drugs. We as leaders in this country should be drawing the line on these issues now. We should be drawing the line firmly and clearly and recognising the problems we already have with drugs, particularly tobacco and alcohol, which are legal. Tobacco is a dangerous drug and one which is quite difficult to stop using. Surely we must draw the line. I encourage Premier Kennett to do so before it is too late.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All Australians should be aware of the troubles facing our wool industry at present, with world prices recently sinking below the cost of production and many producers still suffering the effects of, or recovering from, drought. Nowhere is this being felt harder than in my electorate of Calare, and to make matters worse many wool growers have been </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>dealt yet another blow which deserves urgent federal government attention. Until recently, few people outside Calare had even heard of Ovine Johne's disease, and because it is largely confined to the central tablelands of New South Wales it appears to have been given only scant attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Johne's disease is caused by a bacteria that invades the small intestine of sheep causing the animal to waste away and eventually die. In the worst cases it has wiped out 15 per cent of flocks. The disease is believed to have originated in Europe and appears to thrive in cold climates, which is why it has so far remained largely confined to the tablelands of New South Wales, although any thought of its exclusivity to this region were erased by its discovery in several Victorian flocks in December last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no known cure. The bacteria lives in the soil and the disease was first detected in the Orange district in the drought of the early 1980s when animals were grazing closer to the soil. Because no action was taken back then, it has resurfaced in the latest drought over a more widespread area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far 130 properties are affected. One hundred of those are in the Calare electorate. These fine wool producers have moved quickly to try to contain the problem, placing bans on the sale of any breeding stock from flocks in which Johne's disease has been detected. This action has left many facing financial ruin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One letter I received from an Orange district stud last week gives an indication of the sorts of hardships Johne's disease is causing to farming families. Since the disease was detected in the stud flock last month, the family has been unable to sell any of its stock. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will read you part of this letter. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope this letter will show you how devastated we are at the news last week of Ovine Johnes in our stud. The stud was formed in 1988 with Stud Sheep bought as well as ewes with one hundred years of breeding that our family had achieved and have embarked on an extensive breeding program artificially inseminating all the stud ewes with top sires. This has been costly but as we thought well worth the money. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1435"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In April of this year we had 830 commercial ewes sold to Victoria for $37.00 (a total of $30,710) only to be told when the truck was at Bombala that we were under suspicion of Johnes Disease. These people in Victoria were also after as many sheep as we could supply so another 300 would also have been sold. My husband turned the truck around at Bombala and we no longer had our interest payment and carry-on money for the planting of our wheat. We had also sold $50,000 worth of rams to Melbourne to be delivered later this year. In just 4 weeks we have already lost over $90,000. We have documented proof of all these sales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the drought we were struggling to pay our interest in 95. We felt it was a temporary state of affairs and we were confident we could trade out of this short term difficulty. I tried unsuccessfully to date, to have Northern Division B in the Bathurst Pastures Protection Board District drought declared exceptional circumstances even though we met all criteria and we are surrounded on three sides by exceptional circumstances. With an interest subsidy last year we would have been financial. Now Ovine Johnes Disease.</PARA>
<PARA>This lost income has meant the family has been unable to make an interest payment to the bank. It has also had no money to sow a wheat crop, therefore missing out on the chance to take advantage of the current high prices in that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue that if ever a case existed for receiving exceptional circumstances assistance from the Commonwealth government, this is it. I know an informal approach was made to the former primary industries minister to see whether property owners affected by Johne's disease could qualify for funding under the rural adjustment scheme provisions. Understandably, with so much money already going out to drought affected families, the minister was loath to consider extending funding to farmers whose income has been hit by Johne's disease or any other disease. I would, however, implore the new government to show some compassion to these families who really are suffering and to reconsider the former minister's stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many communities in my electorate rely almost entirely on the sheep and wool industries for their existence. One of the major problems is that there is no test to find out if sheep actually have Johne's disease. The only way to do that is to kill them and carry out an autopsy.   </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A New South Wales agriculture department researcher at Orange is working on developing a reliable live test method. However, I am told that budget cuts by the Carr Labor government have seriously jeopardised this research. Clearly this problem, which threatens an industry that for decades was the lifeblood of the country, deserves more than to be left in the hands of farmers alone and the Carr state government&mdash;a government which seems to have done everything it can to destroy its credibility in the eyes of the agriculture industry and the rural community in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge the federal minister, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), the neighbouring electorate, to tackle this problem with the sort of leadership it deserves and intervene to ensure it does not become a national disaster. It may only be present in a small part of New South Wales, but it clearly is a national industry problem&mdash;with ramifications for our live mutton export as well if our overseas buyers decide that Johne's poses any sort of risk. We only have to look at the impact mad cow disease has had on the British industry. Market responses to similar mycobacterial diseases in animals, such as tuberculosis, are also well known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way regulations stand now, it is estimated the disease will be prevalent in a majority of sheep flocks in New South Wales within 15 years. The time to act is now, before it becomes so widespread that it will be far too expensive to take any control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A steering committee has been set up and has put forward a strategic eradication plan, which is now open for public comment. Letters and deputations I have received from concerned producers already indicate there is widespread dissension within the industry over whether this plan will work. The criticisms already out there suggest it is not off to a good start. The steering committee admits its plan cannot work without the full support of affected producers. Indeed, from its draft plan the committee says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the sheep industry now has a very short window of opportunity to bring this disease under control before eradication becomes uneconomic as more and more properties and pastoral districts <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1436"> become infected by the introduction of infected sheep.</PARA>
<PARA>Whatever plan is finally adopted, the chairman of the steering committee has indicated that the Commonwealth would need to contribute as much as $3 million to make it work. I believe there should also be a compensation scheme to enable graziers to de&hyphen;stock and safely replace their breeding flocks with minimum penalty, because at the moment the likely cost of eradication will be far greater than the cost of the disease itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have informed the minister that I was to make this speech. I would urge him to seriously consider this call for assistance, because I believe our marino industry is at grave risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing&mdash;and in stressing the need for more, not less, government support for the bush&mdash;I endorse the views expressed a moment earlier by the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) on reduced bank services. My electorate is also to lose two Commonwealth Bank branches, at Kandos and Canowindra&mdash;thanks in no small way to this government, and the one before, totally supporting privatisation, economic rationalism and government downsizing policies that bear no sympathies for the needs of rural communities like Kandos, where no banking service apart from a post office will remain.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<ELECTORATE> (Adelaide)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.59 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance relates to the ill service given to the people of South Australia, and in particular to my constituents in the federal seat of Adelaide, by a succession of Labor governments at both state and federal level. Since the late 1980s, South Australia, and in particular my inner city electorate of Adelaide, has been a microcosm of the economic and social costs associated with Labor's mismanagement. I would like to take this opportunity to alert the House to just some of these costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth unemployment in Adelaide city areas has remained at between 30 and 40 per cent since the early 1990s and, of course, the inner city central business district has witnessed many of the direct social consequences of prolonged youth unemployment. Increases in youth homelessness, crime, alcohol and drug <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> abuse, and a general despondency among the younger people in Adelaide were all reported to my electorate office by a number of concerned voluntary and youth support groups working within the Adelaide area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the other end of the scale, the generally poor prospects of the labour market resulted in a drain of many of Adelaide's talented and experienced workers to the larger eastern states in a search for quality employment. The South Australian business sector has also experienced an exodus of managers and corporate personnel, many of whom had lived and worked in my electorate of Adelaide for many years. In 1980, there were 88 listed company headquarters in South Australia. By 1993, this figure had dropped to 39.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This departure of many good South Australians from the state during the worst years of state Labor undoubtedly contributed to South Australia having the worst population growth rate among the mainland states, with all the negative implications for the housing industry, consumer demand and small businesses. In the last year of the state Labor government in South Australia, the state had the lowest growth in investment of all Australian states while the number of available jobs declined by 11,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of South Australia's 62,000 small businesses are in my electorate, and the burden of Labor's mismanagement and apathy fell particularly heavily upon this sector. The then minister for small business&mdash;a South Australian&mdash;Senator Chris Schacht, epitomised the political cynicism and opportunism of federal Labor. Despite recommendations and the pleading of several small businesses and retail groups for the then Labor government to address the problem of unfair competition, red tape and an unfair tax burden, the then minister could only introduce the Trade Practices Amendment (Better Business Conduct) Bill into the parliament in the last fortnight of the parliamentary sitting prior to the calling of the 2 March election. This was after 18 months of lobbying by the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not surprisingly, significant portions of the small business community questioned the commitment of the Labor Party to small <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1437"> business. This last&hyphen;ditch attempt to show some concern for the small business sector addressed few of the issues raised by the small business groups which consulted with me during the campaign and the small business sector was even more disheartened by Labor's inability to promise anything but more of the same in the lead&hyphen;up to the election. In stark contrast, the new Howard government has moved to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor, is in the process of forming small business consultative groups, and has already cut the volume of red tape faced by small business in its dealings with the Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another outstanding piece of political cynicism was the Labor government's&mdash;and, in particular, the then Minister for Transport's&mdash;belated announcement of the funding to clean up the Australian National Islington toxic dump site at Kilburn in my electorate just three days before the 2 March election was announced. This was after I had lobbied the then minister for two years for an urgent and responsible reaction by the Labor government. It will now fall upon the coalition government to finally respond to the legitimate concerns of my constituents by cleaning up this contaminated site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the political cynicism shown by Labor was not restricted just to their time in government. Their recent election campaign of fear and loathing introduced a whole new element of deceit. Let me remind the House that the members on the other side participated in deliberate misrepresentation of coalition policy, including the claim that a coalition government would introduce timed phone calls and destroy Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another political stunt used by my Labor opponent in the campaign for Adelaide was the use of a letter supporting her, signed by Australia's Olympic soccer coach, Mr Eddie Thomson, in the guise of an ordinary neighbourhood letter. I am reliably informed that permission was never sought or given for the circulation of this letter. The fact that this piece of material was authorised by someone else gives further weight to this claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party was cynical in government and desperate in the election campaign and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remains unapologetic and arrogant about its economic and social performance whilst in government at both federal and state level. I am pleased to report to the House, however, that the job of undoing Labor's mess is well under way in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the end of the 1980s, state debt in South Australia amounted to $8,000 million, with the State Bank alone recording a $3,150 million loss. Simultaneously, 30,000 South Australians were out of work. Ties with the union movement had restricted the then Labor government's ability to implement the structural reform to the economy that commissioned reports&mdash;such as the one done by the Arthur D. Little Institute&mdash;had stated was overdue and critical if South Australia was to avoid becoming the economic and demographic backwater of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, the South Australian people comprehensively dismissed a Labor government short on ideas and performance, giving the state Liberal Party a 26&hyphen;seat majority in the lower house of the state parliament. After only a year, the Brown government had already begun to receive commendations from the national press for its debt reduction strategies, its investment and marketing initiatives and, perhaps most importantly of all, the putting into place of a clear vision of a new era of security and opportunity for South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House will be pleased to know that business and investment are slowly returning to the state, led by such companies as Australis Cable TV, EDS, Motorola and MBF. By the middle of last year, indications from the South Australian Chamber of Commerce were that business confidence in the state was finally on an upward trend. In the December quarter of last year, South Australia recorded the highest quarterly and annual growth in gross state product of all states. The state debt is being cut faster than expected with projections of the state debt improving by $256 million since the last state budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state government is also on target for a budget surplus by 1997&hyphen;98, despite inheriting a $350 million deficit from the state Labor government. Developments via the Brown government's IT2000 strategy in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1438"> technology and science sector now assist the return of $2.6 million in export earnings to the state from this sector. South Australia's internationally renowned wine industry, buoyant from new sources of investment and confidence in South Australia's fiscal environment, is on target to return $1 billion to the state in export earnings by the end of the century. Morgan and Banks Ltd, Australia's leading recruitment company, has also recently revealed that South Australian job seekers are among the most optimistic in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of the 12 federal lower house seats in South Australia, 10 are held by the Liberal Party. The Labor Party of South Australia has much to answer for and has been sent a very clear message by the people of South Australia that propriety and responsibility in the financial management of the state and the country must always remain at the highest of levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The colony of South Australia was unique. Unlike other Australian settlements, South Australia was not settled by convicts. It was settled by innovators, pioneers and persons of conviction and innovation who were often escaping religious intolerance in their homelands and economic depression. Today, after many years of Labor, South Australia is again beginning to emerge as an important centre of innovation and opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paul Keating asked the Australian people at the last election for another term to complete Labor's `Big Picture'. But, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> last week, disillusioned workers believed that Mr Keating was `off fighting battles with little relevance to the battle of their daily lives'. Members on the opposite side of the chamber forgot individuals in seats like Adelaide who had been isolated by Labor in its pursuit of economic and social policies aimed more at filling the trophy cabinet than delivering real economic management and social justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor forgot the age pensioner, the jobless youth, the members of struggling small businesses and their families, and those who, despite hard work, could not get ahead but ultimately decided that enough was enough. The new coalition government at the federal level and the Liberal government in South <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia have begun the task of undoing Labor's economic mismanagement by reducing public sector debt, encouraging business and investment, and making the tough decisions needed to ensure that the lifestyle we enjoy in South Australia continues for us and for future South Australians.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) earlier announced that he will be visiting Indonesia in August. I rise in all earnestness to speak in this grievance debate because some time in the next few weeks the Indonesian government will make a decision on how to meet that country's energy demands. It is a decision which will have great ramifications for all Indonesians and, depending on the outcome, it has the capacity to affect Australia and the entire South&hyphen;East Asia region. The question to be decided is whether Indonesia will go nuclear. Until there is an answer to that, the region must wait with bated breath.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not be an easy decision to make. Every advanced nation in the world has grappled with the question of how to supply the energy demands of its population. Since the development of nuclear power it is a question that has become more difficult to solve. Australia made that choice 30 years ago. We chose to say no to nuclear power, and I do not think we have had any cause to regret the fact since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Indonesians' decision is based on their estimated demand for energy come the year 2015. Government figures say that by that time the island of Java alone will require 32.6 gigawatts of electricity, of which only 25 gigawatts will be available from conventional energy sources such as hydroelectricity, geothermal electricity, gas, steam, natural gas, oil and coal. The government is considering whether to make up the energy shortfall by installing 12 nuclear power reactors on the islands of Java and Bali, the first to be built in the shadow of Mount Muria and scheduled to commence in 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think I am alone in this House in my concern over the Indonesians' decision. Safety is a real question. The dangers, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1439"> threats to the environment and to the people of the region, including Australians, are very genuine. It is a delicate situation but, after considering the facts surrounding the development of the proposed reactors, my view is that the Australian government should now use all of its influence and pursue this matter through all relevant channels to convince the Indonesians that nuclear energy is not necessarily the road best travelled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Indonesian government has pointed to nuclear power as a cheaper energy source than traditional forms of energy. That argument is open to debate. In 1993 the World Bank stated that the costs associated with nuclear power could be between 20 to 50 per cent higher than coal based energy. In fact, Mr Djali Ahimsa, the Director&hyphen;General of BATAN, Indonesia's national nuclear agency, has stated as much himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has admitted that the price of nuclear energy for Indonesia will at the very best be equal to other energy sources but certainly not cheaper. In fact, the only reason the Indonesian government can point to nuclear energy as providing cheaper energy is that when doing its sums it has considered only the construction and production costs for the 12 reactors. It has not taken into account the costs related to environmental and health regulations, nor the prohibitive costs involved in disposing of nuclear waste. That leads me again to Mr Ahimsa, who stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the United States . . . there are some nuclear power plants which are more expensive in terms of production costs because the United States government issues more regulations for power plants to comply with.</PARA>
<PARA>Is this supposed to allay our fears? I doubt it. Obviously, the Indonesian government does not intend its reactors to operate along the same stringent safety lines followed in the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is further cause for concern. I do not know if the House is aware of this but the site of the first reactor, should it be built, is Mount Muria on the island of Java, which is actually a dormant volcano. In December 1989, the epicentre of an earthquake registering nine on the Richter scale&mdash;a very large <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tremor&mdash;was only about 50 kilometres from the proposed site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Java is recognised as the second most active of nine international seismic zones. Six years ago there was an earthquake in Sumatra which rated seven on the Richter scale and killed 200 people. In December 1992 there was an earthquake at Flores Maumere which killed 1,500 people. In 1977, an earthquake just off Sumbawa island and its resulting tidal wave, or tsunami, killed 100 people. I can go back to 1883 and the devastation caused by the volcano Krakatoa, the eruption of which was heard as far away as Australia, and the resulting tidal wave which killed 30,000 Indonesians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These natural tragedies cannot be ignored. Do we really want to see the Indonesians build 12 nuclear reactors, each with an energy capacity of 1,800 megawatts&mdash;greater than that of the ruined Chernobyl reactor&mdash;in such an environment? There are those who would argue that Japan has over 50 nuclear reactors, each built on an island which has had its share of seismic activity, all without any mishaps. I suggest that no building or reactor can be 100 per cent safe from an earthquake on a massive scale. There are others who would question the safety of any reactor positioned on a fault line in a country where political power often conflicts with technical expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has much to fear from this nuclear program should it progress. If any of the proposed reactors were to suffer an accident, and if such a breakdown were to occur between the months of October and April, it could spell disaster for us. During this period, the northern Australian wet, the prevailing winds could blow emissions from Java to the shores of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. You would have a situation where people as far away from Java as Broome, Townsville and Alice Springs could be the victims of radioactive fallout&mdash;a ghastly image that has recently been supported by studies conducted by Dr John Taylor of the Australian National University. If this sounds a little far fetched, remember the Chernobyl disaster and how its radioactive emissions spread thousands of kilometres across Europe, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1440"> finally reaching the dairies and farms of Scotland and Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what of the nuclear waste produced by these reactors? Indonesia's unpredictable and violent natural environment poses great threats in this regard as well. Nuclear waste dump sites are potentially dangerous because of the possible penetration of radioactivity into the water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How will the Indonesians protect their dump sites from the geologically unstable nature of their islands? How will they prevent the penetration of radionuclides into the sea? Where will Indonesia find the space to dump its waste considering its massive population and small land content? Will it look to Australia for assistance? All of these questions are not answered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as in the past we have sent our hazardous waste to Indonesia for storage or recycling, will they now look to us to accept their radioactive waste? We are more geologically stable. We have large expanses of arid land suitable for such use. But should we consider now how we will respond to such a request before we even contemplate the construction of these reactors?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The World Bank has itself expressed reservation about the disposal of nuclear waste among the world's advanced nations. It reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The environmental problems associated with radioactive wastes have not been fully resolved in the OECD countries . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And we are not expected to question Indonesia's capacity, while still a developing nation, to deal with nuclear waste! How can we have faith in its ability while others, such as the United States and the UK, have failed to adequately deal with this problem in the past?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is indeed a delicate question. When was the last time someone stood in a grievance debate in this House and argued against the Sellafield nuclear reactor site in the UK or the over 100 nuclear reactors in the United States? I am not questioning the right of the Indonesian government to consider nuclear power. I do not stand against the proposal out <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of some warped racist notion of `it's okay for them but not okay for you'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has always been an aura of danger surrounding nuclear power. In Indonesia's case, should they proceed with their program, it is my belief that the dangers facing their population and environment and Australia, which is what I really care for, through its sheer proximity are, however, much greater than normal. As such, I think we have an obligation not only to our own citizens and to their health but also, as a responsible member of the region and a close partner of the Indonesians, to do our best to persuade them from taking this path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should offer our technological expertise to the Indonesians. We should assist them in developing alternative energy programs. In doing so, I believe we can avert any future tragedy and protect the delicate environmental balance of our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stated at the beginning, I raise this matter in the grievance debate today following the announcement that the Prime Minister is going to visit Indonesia. On behalf of the people of Australia, I hope that this is one topic he will at least raise with the Indonesian ministers and the government. If he cannot do it himself, he should arrange to have bipartisan meetings not only expressing our concern but also, as I said earlier in my speech today, offering our expertise to assist them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I still believe deep down that if they were to go ahead and build these reactors in those areas which have been recognised as experiencing regular fault activity it is our country in the future that will suffer. I do not believe we can be ostriches, put our heads in the sand and say, `It is too late. It has happened now. No&hyphen;one brought it to our attention.' That is why I have risen to speak in the grievance debate today. People are far more expert than me&mdash;I can do it only from what research is available from the library, from what I have been able to read and also from the concerns expressed by many people over these particular activities that are going to be designed to overcome the energy problems of our near neighbour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe our population at the top end of Australia is closer to Indonesia and will suffer <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1441"> more effects if something were to happen than either Sydney or Melbourne or perhaps Western Australia. The very top end of our nation needs to be protected, as does all of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the grievance debate today probably having the most significant grievance of them all&mdash;the fact that the Northern Territory has waited some 85 years for the north&hyphen;south railway to be constructed. It has been 85 years since a promise was made by the then government that a rail link would be constructed. It is only now with the Howard coalition that the railway looks like being a possibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many years ago Darwin was always considered to be the gateway from Europe into Australia. Today I believe that the Territory is Australia's gateway to Asia. The Northern Territory is spearheading Australia's link with new growth areas of Asia and it offers companies in the rest of Australia the opportunity to use Darwin as a point from which to foray into the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a product of both its history and location, the Territory is strongly focused on the region. The Territory has representative offices in Jakarta, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing and Shanghai to assist exporters and identify business opportunities. The Territory Minister for Asian Relations, Trade and Industry, Eric Poole, regularly leads delegations of Territory and interstate businesses to Asia where the government endorsement gives added credence to exporters and enables greater access to business and government leaders. The Territory also regularly participates in trade related expositions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major trade exposition the Territory supports is NT Expo, which will be held in Darwin next month from 25 to 30 June. NT Expo has grown to be one of the premier national and international trade initiatives of Australia. More than 700 international delegates from countries, including China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines, Macau, Papua New Guinea, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Singapore, Pakistan and New Zealand, are expected this year, as well as business people from throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Key drawcards include a series of conferences in mining, construction, agribusiness, tourism and transport links. There will also be business matching sessions and a range of seminars which will be held in conjunction with the Expo. The first meeting of Australia's trade ministers under the new coalition government will also be held in Darwin during NT Expo 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">NT Expo has grown to be one of the largest business gatherings in Australia and South&hyphen;East Asia out of which millions of dollars worth of business is written. It is also a vivid illustration of the successful blend of western and Asian business practices for which the Territory has become well known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1990s, the Territory has concentrated on forming strong alliances in business, trade, government, culture and sport with our northern neighbours. We have focused on the regions closest to us both in proximity and in its relatively youthful stage of development. The new growth areas in Asia are BIMP and EAGA. For those who do not know, BIMP and EAGA incorporate the country of Brunei, some of the eastern provinces of Indonesia, east Malaysia including Labuan, and the southern Philippines. EAGA stands for east ASEAN growth area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with the Territory, the region is one of enormous potential. It has a market base of some 40 million customers of growing prosperity, relatively cheap and abundant land covering almost 700,000 square kilometres, major mineral, petroleum and natural gas deposits, rich marine resources and enormous tourism potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first formal mark of recognition of the Territory's efforts in this area came in 1992 when the Territory government signed a memorandum of understanding with Indonesia. It was the first and only time that a government of Indonesia had signed such a memorandum with a state or territory in preference to a national government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to advise that I was at the signing of that MOU. The MOU calls for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1442"> involvement between the Northern Territory and the 10 eastern provinces of Indonesia to develop manufacturing and processing industries, trade and infrastructure. It also calls for the joint development of a range of other areas including professional services, transport, technology transfer, tourism and primary industries. A joint policy committee with representatives from both countries was set up to cut red tape and to facilitate business ventures and cross&hyphen;investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While business and trade with the region have steadily grown, the Territory has continued to forge relationships with EAGA. In November 1994, while a Territory delegation attended the first Asian business convention in Mindanao, the Territory was invited to participate in BIMP and EAGA. There are now in place formal agreements with almost all members of EAGA, building on the 1991 MOU with Indonesia. Pacts have been signed with the governments of the Philippines and Brunei. Agreements relating to Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan are expected to be signed this year. The Territory's Minister for Asian Relations, the Hon. Eric Poole, will sign a memorandum of intent with Labuan tomorrow, Tuesday, 28 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These agreements have put a high degree of certainty into commerce between our countries and are being used for a variety of Territory and national companies. In the five-year period since the Territory began focusing its efforts into EAGA, the value of two-way trade, excluding mineral fuels, has increased from $30 million to more than $130 million. In fact, trade with the BIMP countries is already $122.8 million for the financial year to March, compared with the $120.5 million for the whole of the last financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This spectacular growth seems set to continue. In fact, the Territory's exports to the BIMP countries are likely to top $170 million. Overall, this is a $50 million or 40 per cent increase in exports. Indonesia is at the top of the export list, now worth $65.2 million, followed by the Philippines at $42.5 million, Malaysia at $9.8 million and Brunei at $5.3 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main export continues to be live cattle, with a value last year of $101.8 million <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compared to $113.5 million for the whole of 1994-95 and $69.3 million for 1993-94. The other significant export area is transport equipment, with $9.1 million exported principally to Indonesia in the year to March, compared to $2.7 million for all of 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imports from the BIMP region are also on the rise, which further emphasises the Territory's success in trading with the region. It reflects the growing commerce and the effective transport links between the BIMP countries and the Territory. I can give an illustration of the growth in transport and telecommunications access to South-East Asia that has occurred in recent years in order to meet the growing demands of business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1990, the Territory had one shipping company operating an international shipping service to Singapore and some ports in Indonesia without any regular connections to the eastern seaboard of Australia. In November 1992, the government  introduced a subsidy which saw Darwin based Perkins Shipping introduce a regular shipping service to Ujung Pandang, which proved to be a vital stimulant to the development of regular shipping links into the region. Today the subsidy has been dropped and services run on purely commercial lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996, 12 regular shipping services operated throughout the Territory providing Australia's most comprehensive shipping services to Indonesia. They also provided regular connections between the Territory and Singapore and Christmas Island; Port Moresby and Lae in Papua New Guinea; Port Kelang, Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan in Malaysia; General Santos City and Cagayan De Oro in the Philippines; Yokahama and Kobe in Japan; Rotterdam, Hamburg and Hull in Europe; and a number of other ports on the eastern and western coasts of Australia, as well as on-inducement services throughout Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An additional shipping service running between Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Bali, Jakarta and Singapore begins operating in August this year. This luxury cruise liner will have the capacity to carry up to 300 passengers as well as 220 containers, including 96 refrigerated containers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1443">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to booming demand, international air services have also been expanded. In 1994-95, Darwin airport recorded the highest growth in international and domestic passenger traffic of all FAC airports in Australia. During the same period, visitor numbers to the Territory topped one million for the first time, up almost 200,000 since 1990-91. Compared to 1990, when nine international outbound air services operated each week, in 1996 there are 20 outbound and 21 inbound flights each week. These directly connect the Territory with Brunei, Ambon, Denpasar, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Kupang and Japan. More direct air links are being introduced and Qantas has recently announced an additional service to Singapore from July this year. A direct air service between Darwin and Davao City, on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao in the EAGA, is also likely to be introduced in the next 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Supporting these far reaching transport services are advanced infrastructure and telecommunications facilities. Darwin's new international airport opened in December 1991. The airport has 24-hour operation with no restriction on aircraft movement. Darwin's new $75 million port will be  operational in 1997. The port will be equipped with world-class technology and will be largely automated. It will be able to handle live cattle, bulk and general cargo and will complement the existing container centre at Stokes Hill. Ultimately, the new deep water port will be capable of other commercial uses such as oil rig tendering, ship repair and extended bulk loading. Not far from the port in the trade development zone, the Territory government has spent some $800,000&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve for the future of one of a number of successful labour market programs that have operated in both the Blacktown local government area and the electorate of Greenway over the last three years. The particular program I refer to is the Blacktown regional economic and employment development task force, the BREED Task Force, funded under the Office of Labour Market Adjustment during the term of the previous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor government. I believe the benefit of this task force to the local community has been the successful completion of a number of projects that will help to make the region of western Sydney a better place to invest and work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this brief address I would like to quickly report on a number of these projects that were mentioned in the 1995 annual report of BREED. The first project I would like to refer to is the adult literacy and numeracy coordinator. The need to introduce an adult literacy and numeracy program to improve the employment skills of workers at risk was identified in an earlier BREED project. This is an area in which Minister Kemp has attempted to portray the previous Labor government as having done nothing&mdash;a claim that is totally and absolutely false. I am sure many groups such as BREED would be greatly offended by the comments of Minister Kemp, which were not only false but gratuitous and unhelpful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A coordinator was employed for a period of 12 months to, among other things, develop a range of strategies for raising awareness of literacy and numeracy such as developing networks of literacy and numeracy and employment skilled programs using established programs where possible and organising and coordinating consultative forums consisting of providers, employers and peak bodies in the field of literacy, numeracy and employment skills to provide an ongoing dissemination and sharing of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the outcomes of this project was the production of a monthly newsletter which covers all areas relating to literacy and numeracy. This newsletter and the coordinator have acted as a catalyst for the various groups delivering literacy and numeracy services in our area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another program I would like to refer to is the training needs analysis. The aim of this project was to identify the training needs of major industries within the region and to evaluate these needs and to assess the availability of training infrastructure. The report highlighted that a major impediment to economic growth in this region was the inability of the local work force to share in the benefits of development because of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1444"> skill gap that existed between the growing demands of industry and the skills of the local work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of critical trends were identified which would make it more difficult for less skilled workers and managers to get access to and maintain good jobs. These trends included the need for a higher level of education and training and to continually upgrade skills to adapt to new technology and product requirements, greater emphasis on team work and communication skills to enable individuals and teams to focus on improving enterprise productivity and meeting customer demands, and efforts by firms to support and reward their core work force by providing them with some career paths and  financial incentives to stay with the firm to reduce turnover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final report, which contained 21 recommendations, was launched by the very respected and prominent businessman Mr Bill McNamara OAM, Chairman of the Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board, at the University of Western Sydney, Nirimba campus. The launch consisted of a summary of the findings by the consultants and a detailed workshop consisting of representatives from 50 industries and training organisations. The final report refers to the critical training needs of local industry as being in the areas of quality related training, computer software, team work, safety, sales and marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also recommended that there is a need to more closely study the training needs of major firms in the region, to assess the skill base in the region and education and training infrastructure, and to identify ways to more closely link industries with local education and training institutions such as high schools, TAFE colleges and the University of Western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another project that I would like to refer to is the small business incubator. A feasibility study has been carried out to ascertain the commercial viability of a small business incubator to assist small business to become economically viable. It is apparent that there is a high demand for a small business incubator in our region.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to report that, at this period, negotiations are being carried out for the refurbishment of two buildings in the Nirimba College of TAFE for this purpose. I would encourage the current government to ensure that appropriate funds are available to enable the establishment of this small business incentive for Greenway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another project I will refer to is the economic development strategy. This project has produced an excellent document, particularly for new investors in the area, as it gives a detailed background of the population mix, skills of the work force, industries already established in the region, training and education facilities available and regional rail and road links. Details were also provided on major industry groupings in the Blacktown local government area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report also shows that Blacktown industrial estates are strategically located along major transport corridors, east-west and north&hyphen;south. It also shows that rail passes near to the Seven Hills, Kings Park and Riverstone industrial estates. Reference is also made in the report that Blacktown has a large diverse economic base across manufacturing industries, agriculture and tourism. Its industrial base contains some of the largest manufacturing and distribution corporations in Australia marketing their products nationally and internationally. These include Sharp, Sony, Pepsi, BHP, Transfield, Westbus, United Distillers, P&amp;O Cold Storage, Atlas Copco, Lidco, Trane and Davis Holdings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another project that I will mention briefly was the West Jobs campaign. The BREED coordinator, Steve Frost, took part in the very successful West Jobs campaign. This campaign was run by the Outer Western Sydney and Central Western Area Consultative Committee. Its aim was to find 4,000 positions in a period of three months. It was overwhelmingly successful due to the support of small business and, in fact, 7,500 positions were created during that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is always difficult to measure the success of labour market programs, but I believe the calibre of the people on the task force, the number of ongoing BREED projects, and the networking between task force members and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1445"> other regional bodies, both state and federal, will contribute to increased employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The BREED Task Force has always been able to attract high quality people, and I seek leave to table a list of members who have served on the task force over the past three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MK6">Mr MOSSFIELD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would particularly like to refer to the support that the task force has received from small business and through the contributions of John Allen, the first Project Coordinator of BREED and also the current President of the Blacktown City Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Acting Chairperson of BREED, Miss Beverly Norton, who is the Executive Director of the Blacktown City Chamber of Commerce. The outstanding input that they have been able to make on behalf of small business has been vital in developing projects that will increase employment growth in small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should mention that all task force members gave their time freely and that no attendance fees or out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses were paid to task force members. As a former chairman of BREED, I thank the task force members and their employers for their generous contribution to the work of the BREED task force. I urge the government not to add this type of important community based group to their forthcoming budgetary slash and burn proposals.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening in the grievance debate I bring to the attention of the House a couple of unrelated but very important issues affecting my electorate of Lyne. The first issue concerns the inadequate number of nursing home beds available in my electorate. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would no doubt agree that there is an inadequate number of nursing home beds in your electorate, just as there is right up and down the New South Wales coast. In the last two years a strange anomaly occurred in the distribution of the allocated nursing home <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> beds in New South Wales. On 1 July 1994 the chairman of the board of directors of the Lower North Coast Area Health Service wrote to me on behalf of his organisation and the broader community generally. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Board of Directors are concerned with the shortfall of nursing home and hostel beds in our local District when compared to the Commonwealth Department of Health formula.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attached table will show that at this stage we are 45 nursing beds short, according to the Commonwealth formula, and 164 hostel beds short. It should be noted that in relation to this last figure, account has not been taken of the proposed 60 bed hostel at Forster.</PARA>
<PARA>That 60&hyphen;bed hostel was subsequently built by Baptist Community Services. In July 1994, the Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health advertised that recurrent funding was available for the provision of new and additional hostel, nursing home and community care services. Target areas published included a nursing home priority for the Great Lakes area. The advertisement indicated that there was a need for an allocation of 30 nursing home beds in the Great Lakes area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two organisations that had established infrastructure in the Great Lakes area in my electorate applied to provide the 30 nursing home beds. The first was the Great Lakes Aged and Invalid Care Association Ltd, a community based organisation. That organisation runs Glacier House, predominantly a hostel, which has been established for a number of years. I think it was first established in 1981. In 1983 it was granted 40 hostel beds and since then it has grown, with the addition of a 10&hyphen;bed dementia care wing. That organisation had secured land adjacent to its establishment for the accommodation of the additional nursing home beds if granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other organisation in the Great Lakes area that had established infrastructure was the Baptist Community Services Organisation. It has a brand new hostel called Kularoo Gardens, which is bigger than Glaica, and which also had the facilities and infrastructure to accommodate the nursing home beds that the Commonwealth Department of Health advertised for. The closing date for applications came and went. I supported both applications <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1446"> because, if the department had been of a mind to allocate the nursing home beds to either of those organisations, it would have been a welcome addition to the services provided in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the surprise of the entire community, 20 beds only were allocated to a company based in Inverell which had no infrastructure in the Great Lakes area. That seemed extremely strange to us. We had great problems in trying to find out what decision making process took place. We subsequently found out that the Inverell company tried to relocate those nursing home beds to Coffs Harbour. I note that that is in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker. When approval for that reallocation was not forthcoming from the department, I understand that the 20 nursing home beds went back into the pool in the department. It has been almost two years since the advertisement for 30 nursing home beds in the Great Lakes area first appeared. Not one brick has been laid towards the implementation and establishment of the 30 nursing home beds in Forster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wrote to the former minister for health and received no response. I have now written to the current Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to try to ascertain what went on within the department, what possessed the department to allocate those beds to a company based in Inverell that had no infrastructure in the region in which those beds were to be allocated. The beds have gone back into the system and the people in the Great Lakes area, where we are desperately short of nursing home beds, have completely missed out. This is a matter of grave concern in an area where we have a high retired population and an increasing need for nursing home beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue I wanted to raise in the grievance debate this evening is that of petrol prices. My electorate of Lyne on the mid&hyphen; north coast of New South Wales is between 300 and 400 kilometres north of Sydney, which is the main distribution point for motor spirit. The majority of motor spirit is transported into the area by road freight, not by rail. Unfortunately, the minister responsible, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> McGauran), who was in the chamber five or 10 minutes ago, is no longer here. I have raised the issue with him. I know that an ACCC inquiry is being undertaken at the moment. I want to highlight this evening some of the inequities that exist in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, I got from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which I presume is the follow&hyphen;on from the Prices Surveillance Authority, an interesting paper on the intervention pricing system and how they establish that intervention price. I went through that paper and found that during the month of May, with some minor variations, the intervention price has been running at 66.62c per litre for motor spirit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is all well and good. Those intervention prices are across all the majors&mdash;Ampol, BP, Caltex, Mobil and Shell. Ampol and Shell were both supposedly running maximum wholesale prices of 66.62c per litre. I spoke to a couple of resellers in Port Macquarie, where we have seen the retail price of unleaded fuel running at about 80c a litre. I asked them what their wholesale price has been during the month of May. After you deduct the freight differential, which is established by the former Prices Surveillance Authority, we found that during the month of May the wholesale prices that they were paying for motor spirit into Port Macquarie ranged from between 71.77c per litre to 72.31c per litre. That is a fair bit higher than the established intervention price set by the Prices Surveillance Authority of 66.62c per litre. So there was a strange anomaly there during that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prices Surveillance Authority is supposed to be setting a maximum wholesale price, to which is added the freight differential, which we know is much greater in country areas than it is in the city. In the city it is zero. Into Port Macquarie it is 3.8c per litre. Anybody who runs a transport business that could get hold of that sort of freight component would be smiling with glee. If you work it out over a 40,000&hyphen;litre load of fuel, it takes a lot of money to drag a semitrailer load of fuel from Sydney to Port Macquarie. That is one of the areas which, hopefully, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1447"> government will address in trying to create a bit of transparency in the petroleum industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the ACCC is running an inquiry into the disparity between country and city prices of fuel at the moment. I urge the minister responsible to suggest to the ACCC that it should also look at LPG prices. At the end of last week a constituent of mine contacted me regarding LPG prices across New South Wales. There is a larger disparity between city and country prices. Mr McGee rang me. He had just bought a new vehicle that will run on LPG. He indicated that across New South Wales last week the Sydney price for LPG was 23.9c per litre, the Taree price was 36.9c per litre, the Coopernook price was 36.9c per litre, while between Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour it was 42.9c per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that it is not the reseller who is creaming the system. When I went back to the motor spirit price and highlighted to the House the difference in wholesale price, the reseller was paying 72.31c per litre on 6 May while the intervention price set by the PSA was 66.62c per litre.</PARA>

<PARA>I point out to the House that this taxation legislation is red hot. It is a red hot breach of a coalition election commitment. It is a breach of faith to the 800,000 small businesses and investors in Australia paying provisional tax. What this government is trying to do with this legislation is to say to those 800,000 Australians that its election promise to reduce the uplift factor for provisional tax was for 1996-97 alone. They are trying to say through this legislation that it was a promise with a sunset. As the sun sets on 30 June 1997, all bets will be off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is proposing to do with this legislation is to introduce an uplift factor of six per cent for 1996-97 alone. When you look at the fine print of the legislation, the fine print that the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) would not mention in his second reading speech, the rate goes back up to 10 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is up to 10 per cent for 1997-98 and they are after a permanent rate of 10 per cent. When the sun sets on 30 June 1997, all bets are off. As the member for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1448"> Corio has correctly pointed out, this is a tax fiddle, a tax diddle by the Howard government and a tax con by the Treasurer, Peter Costello. The legislation provides for a six per cent rate for 1996-97, but then the 10 per cent permanent rate comes into law for 1997-98, 1998-99 and on it goes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is from a government which day in and day out complains to this House and complains to the media and complains all over the nation that they do not have control of the Senate. This government which complains that they do not have control of the Senate had the opportunity with this legislation to keep their election promise chapter and verse. They promised the 800,000 small businesses and investors around the nation that the six per cent uplift factor meant six per cent for now and six per cent for the following financial year&mdash;a six per cent permanent rate. If they do not support the amendment that the Australian Labor Party moves in this House, without their control of the Senate, they are going to entrench in law on the statute books of this nation a 10 per cent permanent rate. That is in clear breach of their very clear election promise on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a massive breach of faith. This is a massive con job on small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees throughout the nation. When John Howard put his hand on his chest and said that there would be a six per cent uplift factor, they all thought that that promise meant a six per cent permanent rate&mdash;not a promise with the sunset, not a promise that changes on 30 June 1997, not a promise that was for one year only, but a promise that was forever. When the Prime Minister put his hand on his chest and got near his heart after a while, they thought that he was talking about six per cent for now and six per cent forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is another Costello con. This is another fistful of dollars, one of the specials of the member for Bennelong, the most experienced member in this House. This is the fistful of dollars offered for the 1996 election campaign to be snatched back on 30 June 1997. It is the fistful of dollars that was offered as a $180 million benefit to small businesses and self-funded retirees which is snatched back for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fiscal year 1997-98 and becomes a $360 million penalty on those people. It is a $180 million benefit up front&mdash;the bribe, the fistful of dollars&mdash;to be snatched back thereafter to become a $360 million penalty for 1997-98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, even Richard Evans could do the mathematics on these things. You do not need to be all that clever. You do not even need to plagiarise anyone on these sorts of issues to work out the mathematics. The mathematics indicate that there would be a $180 million benefit in the first year of this parliamentary term; a $360 million penalty for the second fiscal year, and a $360 million penalty for small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees in the third year. This means a net pain for small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees over the three years of this parliamentary term of $540 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a half billion dollar tax fraud, a tax con and penalty for any of those 800,000 small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees who believe in the fistful of dollars, mark two. For all those people who thought that it was an uplift factor of six per cent for evermore, they now see it snatched back and a tax penalty of over half a billion dollars applying throughout the life of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that this was a promise made only to be broken. This was a promise by the Prime Minister and the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), now the Treasurer, which was made only to be broken. It was a promise used for a very cynical, narrow, short&hyphen;term electoral reason: to get support through bribing 800,000 small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees, knowing the government would snatch it back thereafter and leave those businesses substantially out of pocket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1449"> In fact, when you do the calculation per electorate, small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees in the electorates of Werriwa, Corio, Tangney, Stirling and Isaacs are all going to be on average per electorate $3.7 million worse off over the term of the Howard government because they have not legislated on their election promise. They have legislated for a six per cent uplift factor for 1996&hyphen;97 alone. They know full well as they explain day in day out that they do not control the Senate that they are trying to leave the perma nent rate at 10 per cent. This permanent rate could well remain on the statute books of this parliament for the full three years of the parliamentary term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is a tax bribe snatched back. It is a promise made only to be broken. It is a penalty of $3.7 million per electorate for small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees, the groups that they said they would support. What does that mean for small businesses? The shock and horror of finding a permanent rate of uplift factor on provisional tax of 10 per cent for the out years will damage their cash flow and their investment prospects. It will damage the jobs that the Prime Minister said he would create out of the small business sector. There will be no job creation. There will be no investment or reasonable cash flow for those small businesses in the out years of this first Howard&hyphen;Costello budget when they face an uplift factor on provisional tax of 10 per cent. That 10 per cent permanent rate is shameful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to the Attorney&hyphen;General, the member for Tangney (Mr Williams), representing the government in the chamber now, that if they meant a six per cent permanent rate in the campaign, they should support the amendment that will be moved by the Labor Party in this chamber to say that the promise meant six per cent for now and forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be moving an amendment in this debate to entrench the promise of a six per cent permanent rate in order to keep these people honest. Only the Labor Party is trying to keep honest these people who brought you the charter of airport dishonesty, and who have broken election promises hand over fist. We will do that in this House of Representatives and, hopefully, with the support of the minor parties, we will keep them honest in the Senate, too. If they defeat that amendment, it means that they did not want a permanent rate of six per cent, that they really mean 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when John Howard put his hand on his chest and tried to find his heart and swore on the Bible to all those small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees throughout the nation that he was going to bring the uplift factor to six per cent, they will know that he was not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> telling the truth. They will know that it is nothing more than a con; another fistful of dollars and a tax fraud on the people of Australia by this Howard&hyphen;Fischer government. It is nothing more than plain greed, an outright breach of faith, a tax lie from the last election campaign that we are nailing in this parliament tonight. We are nailing these people down to the true nature of their election commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the wording, chapter and verse, of that particular election commitment. When John Howard and Mr Costello and all those Liberal and National Party candidates throughout the country had their hands on their hearts, these are the things that were on the public and the parliamentary record prior to the last election. It started when the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), then the shadow minister for small business, was on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> program on 24 September 1995. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will improve the provisional uplift factor. In fact, we put an amendment to the House just recently to reduce it to six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>There was no sunset clause and no one&hyphen;year qualification. It was six per cent, full stop. There was no talk about the 10 per cent permanent rate for the out years when Mrs Moylan spoke to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>  program in September of last year. Then with the election campaign approaching, the Prime Minister, then&mdash;and still, of course&mdash;the member for Bennelong, appeared on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS>  program on 28 January and he said to Laurie Oakes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition I am going to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor which affects small business.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that the current rate was eight per cent. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are going to reduce it to a more realistic figure. We have in mind a figure of about six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>That was not six per cent for one year only with a sunset clause but six per cent, full stop. That was the member for Bennelong's solemn promise to the Australian people. That was his promise to the 800,000 small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees in this country who are paying provisional tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then of course as we progressed further into the election campaign&mdash;indeed, the very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1450"> next day&mdash;the shadow Treasurer, the member for Higgins, appeared on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program speaking to Fran Kelly. He pointed out that the uplift factor needed to be reduced. He said that he would set a proper rate, stating that it would be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A proper rate at some kind of average that you would expect incomes to go up, bearing in mind economic growth and the CPI.</PARA>
<PARA>So his commitment was not to mention the six per cent but to say that they had a policy structure for guiding the uplift factor. It would be linked to the rate of inflation and the rate of growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is the Treasurer now saying in this legislation that he is expecting a permanent rate of inflation in Australia of 10 per cent? That is the way he has set the uplift factor. On 2 March the policy structure and policy approach goes out the window; he sits down with the Treasury officials and tries to work out a way in which they can convert this promise into a tax bribe snatched back from the hands of small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees. They have been nailed down, not least of all in their own document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A new deal for small business policy</EMPHASIS> released on 18 February, on the day of the member for Bennelong's policy speech. What the coalition said very clearly in black and white in that small business policy circulated across the nation was, `Reduce the provisional uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent.' Not six per cent for one year only, not six per cent as a one&hyphen;off, but six per cent&mdash;full stop. In the detail of their election policy they had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under a Liberal&hyphen;National coalition government the provisional tax uplift factor will be reduced by 2 per cent to 6 per cent which is more in line with nominal growth in the economy. This measure will have a one&hyphen;off cost of $180 million.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, six per cent&mdash;full stop. Not six per cent with a qualification, not six per cent with a get&hyphen;out clause to say that it is for one year only and a permanent rate. You cannot find a 10 per cent figure in these documents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a diddle. It is a regular con job on the people of this country who pay provisional tax. People now know <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it was nothing more than a bribe, nothing more than an enticement that the coalition would snatch back once the election had been cleared, and of course that is exactly what this government is trying to do in this piece of legislation. The truth is, quite shamefully, in the substance of the debate on these tax bills that the coalition does not want the Australian people to know about the permanent rate of 10 per cent. The government does not want small businesses and self-funded retirees throughout the country to know about its tax swindle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can judge that from the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, the member for Braddon (Mr Miles). He gave a two&hyphen;minute speech. He had 30 minutes at his disposal and he did not mention the 10 per cent permanent rate which is in this legislation. Quite appropriately for the member for Braddon, he was praying no-one would notice. He might even have listed the item for the Lyons Forum, praying at breakfast that nobody would notice that the 10 per cent permanent rate is in the fine print of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in the second reading speech of the parliamentary secretary&mdash;a 30&hyphen;minute opportunity to explain to the people of Australia all the provisions of this legislation&mdash;he gives a two&hyphen;minute speech and does not mention the most important and lasting impact of this legislation: a 10 per cent permanent rate on uplift factor for the assessment of provisional tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gets worse because the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, in another place, issued a press release on 8 May, and again he did not mention the 10 per cent permanent rate. It is not in the second reading speech in this place and it is not in the minister's press release. It reminds me of an episode of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fawlty Towers</EMPHASIS> where they said, `Don't mention the war!' For the coalition it is, `Don't mention the permanent rate in your press release. Don't mention the permanent rate in debate in this place. Let's hope that nobody noticed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The good news for small business and for self&hyphen;funded retirees throughout the country is that the Labor Party has noticed and we are going to keep these people honest. We are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1451"> going to keep them, chapter and verse, to their election promise, that is, six per cent rate&mdash;full stop. That will be the effect of our amendment at the consideration in detail stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my second reading amendment I have made a few points about the impact of this government's policy for small business&mdash;not just the tax con, not just the broken promise and not just the tax fraud that is implicit in this legislation but across the board. Led by the member for Bennelong, this party said that it would do everything for small business. If you listened closely to John Howard's rhetoric throughout the campaign, by now, almost three months after the election, every small business in Australia should be a medium sized business, such was the extent to which the coalition built up expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been the truth, the substance, of this government's record for small business? On the fiscal side, the demand side of the economy, it is withdrawing two per cent of GDP from the income expenditure stream. Their fiscal position is to say to every electorate in the country and to every small business that there will be two per cent GDP withdrawn from the income expenditure stream, which will contract the Australian economy. For all those businesses which rely on spending power in Main Street Australia, particularly businesses in the regions&mdash;Geelong, the north of Queensland, the west of Sydney&mdash;that rely on spending power, this government is winding it back. This government will make it much harder for small business to turn a dollar, reducing their cash flow by the permanent rate in this legislation&mdash;10 per cent on the uplift factor&mdash;and reducing spending power in Main Street Australia by two per cent GDP as a result of their ill&hyphen;timed and ill&hyphen;thought&hyphen;out budgetary policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, my second reading amendment makes the very valid point that since the election this government has wound back its growth forecast. Shortly after the election the Treasurer said that the 1996&hyphen;97 growth forecast was down from 3.75 per cent to 3.25 per cent. The government have revised their growth forecast downwards and believe the uplift factor should be related to the growth <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> forecast. Shouldn't the number tonight be lower than six per cent for 1996&hyphen;97?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they are saying that the economy is slowing faster than anticipated and if revenue flowing through small business is going to be smaller than anticipated at the time of the election campaign, they should be winding down the uplift factor by an equivalent amount. If the growth forecast is down half a per cent&mdash;we know how much weight they put on growth forecasts&mdash;then surely they should have been adjusting that election promise downwards as an act of good faith for the small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees around the country. The government are not doing that. They are showing bad faith and bad judgment according to the context of their election promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further broken promises&mdash;winding back small business support programs such as the export market development grants scheme, the AusIndustry programs, NIES and Innovate Australia programs&mdash;are all hurting small businesses which rely on a critical mass of capital and on government business programs to give them access to information, export markets and new business opportunities. If government does not play that role, small business is strangled away in the economy by bigger business interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no surprise&mdash;in another act of bad faith and bad judgment&mdash;that this government, as we hear day in and day out from the Prime Minister at question time, is failing to support amendments to the Trade Practices Act which strengthen the provisions concerning harsh, repressive conduct in circumstances where a small business is vulnerable and economically captive to another enterprise. The former government had before the Senate, at the time of the parliament's dissolution, a very useful amendment to the Trade Practices Act to protect the interests of small business.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Tangney acknowledges that. If he thinks it is such a good amendment to the Trade Practices Act, why does he not, as Attorney-General, try to convince his Prime Minister that it needs to be resurrected in this parliament? It should be supported in the Senate. It should be a safety <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1452"> valve, a safety net, for small business to ward off the anti-competitive practices of much bigger business interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government were interested in good policy structure, in fair policy structure, for small business, it would amend the Trade Practices Act&mdash;as the member for Tangney has acknowledged. It would support the small business support programs that I have mentioned; it would lower its uplift factor, given that the economy on the forecast of the Treasurer has slowed; and it would not be creating the harm and damage caused by withdrawing two per cent GDP from the income expenditure stream in the forthcoming budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only has the government created pain and no gain for small business but also the government has made the fundamental mistake of abolishing wages policy. Without security on wage outcomes, the monetary authorities&mdash;the Reserve Bank of Australia&mdash;with their forward-looking monetary policy, need to take out insurance against what they do not know on wage movements. That insurance is earlier and higher interest rate movements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there had been a wages policy in place, Australia would by now have had an interest rate cut of at least half a per cent. That has been acknowledged by the commentators and the independent forecasters in the market. If the monetary authorities&mdash;the Reserve Bank of Australia&mdash;had security on their forward-looking monetary policy measured against wage outcomes, if they had an accord mechanism in place, they would have had the security to lower interest rates at the bottom end of the business cycle, to the lasting benefit of home buyers, small businesses and, indeed, all parts of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has abolished wages policy. They have torn away the Reserve Bank's security blanket. They have torn away the prospect of forward-looking monetary policy being measured against security on wages policy. They have denied every single small business in this country an interest rate cut. That is what they have done by ripping up wages policy on 2 March. It is a shameful thing.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could not imagine a government that was serious about helping all those small enterprises throughout the nation doing things which are more contrary to the interests of those enterprises. On this legislation, wages policy, interest rates, amendments to the Trade Practices Act, the abolition of small business programs and the impact of its budget, this Howard-Fischer government has created the situation of all pain and no gain for small business. It is a terrible thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the uplift factor provisions of the legislation, the member for Higgins tried very hard to put in place, when in opposition, a policy structure. Why is he not in the chamber tonight defending that policy structure, trying to help small business and trying to do the decent thing on this legislation?  Let me quote from a speech he made in this place on 8 June 1995. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition believes that the uplift factor should be set at a realistic level which is more consistent with expected rates of income growth and inflation. Headline inflation for the year to March is 3.9 per cent. Why then assume that an average income for a provisional taxpayer will rise by eight per cent?</PARA>
<PARA>It is not a bad question. We are asking it tonight: if the inflation forecast for 1996-97 is around three per cent, then why is the uplift factor set at six per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the out years, on the permanent uplift factor rate, it gets much worse. Can we judge, from the comments of the member for Higgins, that he is expecting an inflation rate of 10 per cent two years from now and that that is how he has decided on the rate of the permanent uplift factor that stands in this legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer is not known for his deep contributions to the economic debate in Australia. I cannot think of a single issue relating to these considerations to which he has added value. My mother always told me that you can judge someone by their friends. I notice that his good friend Michael Kroger had to defend him in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> by saying that he would be good at Treasury because he won the tax prize at Monash University. If we put all our university prizes on the table, he would not get anywhere near the Treasurer's job in this country. I hazard a guess that it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1453"> was a tax prize for tax fraud, a prize for tax con, that he won at Monash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence of his first piece of tax legislation before this parliament suggests that it is all a con. It is all fraud, a tax grab, a piece of fiscal greed, a genuine con job on all those small businesses and self-funded retirees around the nation. He had the policy structure in place. I do not know who writes the speeches of the member for Higgins, I do not know who puts the material before him, but he had the policy structure in place&mdash;you set the uplift factor according to the headline inflation forecast. I can call on no less of an authority than Access Economics in respect of this area. They are well known to the coalition. What did they say in their recent five-year business forecast?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They said that the projected increase in CPI for 1997-98 is 3.3 per cent. Why, then, have a permanent uplift factor of 10 per cent? For 1998-99, it said 4.6 per cent. Again, the permanent rate is at 10 per cent, more than twice the forecast of Access Economics. For 1999&hyphen;2000, it said 3.9 per cent. Again, the permanent rate that Peter Costello has put in this parliament is at 10 per cent&mdash;well over double the amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is totally different from what the Treasurer told the people of Australia before 2 March. Take the Access Economics forecast for nominal GDP, which is perhaps a more accurate measure&mdash;I will wear that as an opposition policy structure at this time. You take the nominal GDP, which is the real GDP plus the inflation rate, and use that as your projected most suitable uplift factor rate in legislation such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does it say for 1997-98? It says 7.1 per cent; for the following year, 8.3 per cent; for the year after that, 6.8 per cent. It is not within cooee of the 10 per cent that sits in this legislation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You should be supporting our amendment in the consideration in detail stage to legislate a six per cent permanent rate. There is nothing wrong with that because no less an authority than the member for Higgins said, `That's your policy structure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some very interesting figures from Treasury that I will be citing to the House in the consideration in detail stage. I say to the member for Higgins, who is probably hiding away in his office right now listening to this debate and trying to work out how six per cent became 10 per cent, trying to work out how he can wiggle his way out of this tax fraud on the Australian people, `Come to the House and explain in the consideration in detail stage how six per cent became 10 per cent on the permanent rate.'

I will only be a couple of minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is wonderful to have campaigned advocating a set of policies and to now see them being implemented. One of the disappointing aspects of the 1993 election was to have advocated a policy package while the then government had no idea as to what they would have done if they won and then to see the then government win the election and run government on an ad hoc basis while we had a plan ready and waiting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a refreshing change, therefore, to speak on a piece of legislation which is delivering on an election promise. In the three years I have been in this place it was common for the then government to put up legislation which completely repudiated what they had promised at the election previously. The coalition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will not take the Australian people for granted as Labor did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. This was a policy announced by the coalition during the last election, and this legislation enacts that commitment. It is also a policy that was lambasted by the Labor Party at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition attempted during the last term of the parliament to reduce the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent only to have the Labor Party oppose it. The Labor Party were being greedy. There are around 800,000 small businesses and investors who will benefit from this legislation. The change shows the coalition's recognition that the uplift factor should be set at a realistic level which is more consistent with expected rates of income growth and inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisional tax uplift factor is essentially a method of bringing forward anticipated tax receipts. It will not save businesses money but it will affect when tax will be paid. This legislation provides an $800 million cash flow advantage to small businesses and investors&mdash;that is, $180 million that can be spent on more jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Economics References Committee tabled a report last year entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A question of balance: the tax treatment of small business</EMPHASIS>, which looked at, among other things, the provisional tax uplift factor. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Almost all submissions and evidence received from the private sector, as well as one of the three submissions received from the public sector, opposed the current level of the provisional tax uplift factor, the most frequently stated reason being that the provisional tax uplift factor was far in excess of inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition has listened to the concerns of the business community&mdash;the engine room of our economy&mdash;and reduced the uplift factor. This is delivering on another election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am nevertheless concerned that we do not have a mandate for this legislation. Just like the promise on the partial privatisation of Telstra, we promised to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor well before the last election. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1455"> However, despite announcing it before the election, the Labor Party, Democrats and Greens allege we do not have a mandate to sell one-third of Telstra. Is this an argument they will use with every piece of legislation that comes before this House?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party have opposed the reduction of the uplift factor before. Will they oppose it again or will they only be obstructionist, jealous bullies when it suits them, irrespective of the mandate the coalition has, the harm they are inflicting on Australia's environment and the disrespect they bring to our institution of democracy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also amends the gift provision of the income tax law to allow deductions for gifts of $2 or more to various funds. I would like to take the opportunity to make an appeal on behalf of an organisation called Kidsafe WA, the Child Accident Prevention Foundation of Australia, to have membership fees paid to it to be made tax deductible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 78(9) of the Income Tax Assessment Act allows a deduction to non-corporate taxpayers for contributions of money or property, subject to certain conditions, paid or given to registered political parties. The Commissioner of Taxation in determination TD 92/114 confirmed that the word `contributions' includes membership subscriptions paid to registered political parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 78(4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which this bill amends to include certain funds, provides a deduction for gifts to certain health, education, research and similar organisations. The act, however, does not define the word `gift', although the dictionary would suggest that a gift would not include membership fees. Therefore, notwithstanding the budget constraints caused by Beazley's $8 billion black hole, I would appeal to the government to include membership fees to such organisations as Kidsafe to be made tax deductible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Presently the act discriminates against charities by denying its members a tax deduction for membership fees, but it allows a tax deduction for members of registered political parties for the same payment. It could be suggested that we have a conflict of interest in allowing tax deductions for membership <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fees to political parties but not charities. I hope this anomaly can be rectified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allowing membership fees to these charities to be tax deductible will assist them in attracting new members and allow the organisation to make a greater contribution to society. While it can be argued that membership fees to political parties is a legitimate deduction, charities deserve equal treatment from the taxation system for the vital and often thankless tasks they perform for the good of the society in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kidsafe is involved in child accident prevention. By giving them more recognition, more incentive to attract members, they will be able to do more work on preventing child tragedies and save the community in other associated costs. I conclude by reminding the House that 10 June is the beginning of Kidsafe Week, and it would be a perfect opportunity to announce that membership fees to it and similar charities would be made tax deductible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill consists of three parts. The first part deals with the provisional tax uplift factor, and I will speak on that in a little more detail shortly. The second part of the bill reintroduces a measure proposed by the previous Labor government to remove a loophole affecting the taxation of buyback share arrangements. The third part of the bill is another component of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill of 1995, proposed by the Labor government last year, to extend the deductibility for taxation purposes of donations to certain worthy charities. I say at the outset that the opposition wholeheartedly supports each of the measures proposed in part 2 and part 3 of the bill, and I shall return to speak further on them in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will return to the first part of the bill, which deals with the change to the provisional tax uplift factor. I will refer to the coalition's policy statement released on 18 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1456"> February of this year. Page 21 of that fairly dubious document sets out the coalition's policies and approach to small business. Dressed up in the rhetoric of restoring the small business sector were a number of proposals for changes to the tax system to ease the burden of capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax on small business. Also included was this promise:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from 8 per cent to 6 per cent at a oneoff cost of $180 million.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition made a great play of this promise to change the tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. They said what a boon this would be for provisional taxpayers such as independent retirees and, in particular, the small business sector. Both the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stated that it was essential and a core part of the coalition's package to revitalise small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the launch of that policy document, the Prime Minister, at a doorstop in Oakleigh in Victoria, spelt out clearly and explicitly the coalition's policy platform in this area. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today I want to confirm that we will be legislating to vary the provisional tax uplift factor to bring it more into line with reality somewhere in the order of 6 per cent as opposed to the present 8 per cent and that is at a revenue cost of $180 million.</PARA>
<PARA>What is clearly implicit in both the Prime Minister's words as well as the coalition's policy document, and supported by other public comment by coalition members in the lead&hyphen;up to the last federal election, is that the reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor from eight to six per cent was to be a permanent&mdash;and I stress the word `permanent'&mdash;measure. Nowhere was there any mention of this occurring only in the 1996-97 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's position, as far as the perception it keenly fostered for itself among small business goes, was clear and unequivocal. It would be changing the provisional tax uplift factor permanently. Now we have this bill which alters the uplift factor for the 1996-97 year but makes no mention of changes to the same uplift factor in future years. Nor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> does it reset the default rate at a lower figure than is presently the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's attempts to fudge its position and back away from its promise are obvious from the words of the member for Braddon (Mr Miles). In his second reading speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will give effect to the coalition's election commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor for the 1996-97 income year to six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>This change of position must come as a great shock and a great disappointment to many small business owners and self-funded retirees who were looking forward to the government keeping one of its much touted promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have now is an attempt by the government to have it both ways on this particular promise. On the one hand, it is claiming that it has honoured its promise to provisional taxpayers to reduce the uplift factor and, on the other hand, it has found a convenient way to weasel out of its commitment by legislating the change for one year only. It then has the temerity and the cheek and the audacity to claim that this was its policy all along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has come to the attention of the opposition, the media and the Australian public that the coalition government is having a great deal of trouble in keeping and delivering on its election promises.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was submitting to the House that the coalition was having a problem delivering on its election promises, that these were promises that were made to be broken and that it had undertaken a massive breach of faith with the Australian people. Whether through its failure to honour its commitments to ensure that the number of university places would be maintained, its commitments to maintain the refugee program and assistance to refugees, or its commitments to expand the export market development program and grants, particularly to small business, this government has made a mockery of the Prime Minister's much repeated <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1457"> claims that none of its promises would be broken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a mark of this government's priorities that it trumpets its Telstra dissolution bill and workplace relations bill as two examples of keeping its promises. Both of these policies are destructive and are far from being in Australia's best interests. Yet issues of fundamental importance such as maintaining the availability of quality education are the areas where the government seems to have no qualms at all about going back on its word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisional tax uplift factor looks to be the latest in a litany, a long line, of promises that the government will fail to keep, so we in the opposition have taken it upon ourselves, in a spirit of conciliation, of good government and in the interests of Australia's small business community and self&hyphen;funded retirees, to make it easier to keep this promise by proposing an amendment to set the default uplift factor at six per cent in perpetuity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the bill before the House this evening seeks to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act as foreshadowed in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget introduced by the then Labor government in respect of share buybacks. Share buybacks occur, for example, when companies seek to reduce the number of their shares on issue by buying them and perhaps cancelling them thereafter. This activity is permissible under the current arrangements and, if proceeded with, certain tax arrangements and circumstances follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments contained in the bill ensure that the full purchase price of a share in an off&hyphen;market share buyback is treated as what is known as disposal consideration for capital gain income tax purposes. Clearly, it is the intent of the bill to prevent exploitation of some three loopholes in regard to share buyback arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the first of these loopholes occurs when shares are bought perhaps at less than market value&mdash;where, for example, company A purchases shares at $100 per share in company B and shortly thereafter company B buys shares back at $1 each. An allowable paper loss of $99 per share is incurred by company B. The amendment basically outlaws this practice. For capital <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gains tax purposes, company B is deemed under the proposed arrangements to pay $100 per share realising effectively no capital loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second loophole occurs when, for example, shares are purchased at $1 a share, are bought back by the seller at $3 a share, yielding a net gain of $2 a share for the shareholder. The amendments to these buyback provisions ensure that the $2 is treated as a capital gain, and a further $2 is treated as dividend. The amount that is treated as capital gain is reduced by the amount treated as dividend, effectively preventing double taxation. The third loophole which would be closed by the proposed amendments was designed to prevent rebatable dividends arising from an off&hyphen;market share buyback creating or increasing tax losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final component of this bill deals with amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act to permit tax deductibility for income tax purposes of gifts of $2 or more to a range of charities. It also extends the period of tax deductibility for certain charitable organisations which are currently tax deductible and enjoy tax deductible status. These charities include the Polly Farmer Federation, a federation dear to the heart of my colleague the member for Corio, who is in the chamber.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say a few words about the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne, particularly its restoration and development trust fund to which this bill grants an extension of time for the purposes of tax deductibility. The Shrine Trust was established in 1992 to raise funds for the restoration of Melbourne's beloved Shrine of Remembrance. It was realised some years back that the waterproofing membrane under the terraces beneath the shrine had eroded allowing water to seep into the undercroft area. The beams and supporting terraces <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1458"> had become damaged by water and were at risk of collapse if restoration was not undertaken immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trust fund was set up and has since received overwhelming support from the Victorian government and the people of Victoria. The plight of the shrine was brought to the attention of Victorians by the considerable media coverage that this rather serious problem had attracted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trust raised approximately $2.7 million, half of which came from public donations, the other half from matching funds contributed by the state government. Clearly, it was a matter that touched the hearts of many Victorians. The shrine, standing in Melbourne's magnificent botanical gardens and seen from Melbourne's premier boulevard, St Kilda Road, has been for many years not only one of Melbourne's most prominent landmarks but also a fitting tribute and proud memorial to all those who gave so much for our country in the many theatres of war in which Australia has been engaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The money raised by the trust has been used to finance the necessary restoration work, which involved installing waterproofing and drainage under the terraces, as well as treating the damaged beams in the undercroft. Toilets and a lift were installed to improve the quality of the amenities afforded the many visitors to the shrine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the work of the Shrine Trust is not yet done. Another $10 million needs to be raised to fund plans already on the drawing board to develop the cavernous undercroft area and turn it into a gallery of remembrance that will serve to educate our young people about the great sacrifices and hardships endured by our military forces over the last century. It would be a vivid reminder of the sheer horror of war and I am sure that the people of Victoria will again generously support this most worthy cause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate all those associated with the shrine on their efforts to date with the restoration program and wish them well in their future endeavours. I commend the bill, with the suggested amendment, to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Taxation Laws Amendment (No. 1) Bill and the amendments that are proposed by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I commend him on the excellent speech he gave to the parliament earlier this evening. While the bill before the House does specifically refer to matters such as provisional tax uplift factors for small business and the rules relating to share buybacks for companies, this legislation also extends tax deductibility to organisations nominated in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seek the indulgence of the House to make some comments on one of the organisations nominated for tax deductibility in this legislation; namely, the Polly Farmer Foundation. It is appropriate that I make these comments in view of the fact that Polly Farmer played for and coached that great Australian football team in my electorate, and I refer to Geelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the convener of the parliamentary Aussie Rules group in the parliament, I am sure in making these comments I reflect the sentiments of those members of the group who have an intimate knowledge and love of the game and of Polly Farmer's contribution to it. These remarks are also timely because as I speak the ball has bounced at the Geelong&hyphen;Collingwood match at the MCG this evening. If you are not doing anything after the show, slip down to the theatrette because it is on the big screen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those members who do not know the history of Australian rules very well, Graham `Polly' Farmer rose from humble beginnings to become a legend in his own time. Indeed, the honourable member for Werriwa, after his contribution tonight, is fast assuming that sort of status here on the field of the House. Polly Farmer is one of the greats of the greatest football code of them all&mdash;Aussie Rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1459"> Separated from his mother at nine and leaving school at 14 to become a motor mechanic, Graham Farmer began his senior playing career with the East Perth Royals. As a ruckman, Polly Farmer developed his own unique style of play. When he came to Geelong in 1962 he brought with him a reputation that saw over 10,000 people turn up to his first training run with the Cats. That informa tion was supplied by another Cats legend, Nipper Trezise. Farmer played over 101 games with Geelong with the club reaching the finals each year that he played. He spearheaded the club to its premiership win over Hawthorn in 1963.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very few players in this code achieve legend status in their own day. Very few players, regardless of their skill, can lay claim to achieving a paradigm shift in thinking about the way the game is played. Polly Farmer did it in the 1960s with a unique style of ruck play and handball. Farmer was more than just a tap ruckman with above average around the ground skills. He crafted a style which involves the clever use of the body to catch the ball at boundary throw&hyphen;ins and centre bounces and to feed the ball off to skilful small running players with precision handball at short and long range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farmer virtually revolutionised ruck play and the game with the purity of his skill. The Farmer&hyphen;Goggin combination became one of the most feared ruck and rover combinations in the old VFL. He was a drawcard in his own right like Whitten, Baldock and Barassi. He was the architect of that free flowing running style of football for which Geelong has become famous over the past three decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farmer returned to Western Australia in 1968 to coach East Perth, which won the premiership in the WAFL in 1969 and 1971. He finally hung up the boots, as we say in football parlance, at the tender age of 36.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, Farmer launched the Polly Farmer Foundation with the aim of assisting Aboriginal people in developing their skills in the field of sport and education. It is this foundation which has been mentioned in this legislation here tonight. The foundation intends to assist Aboriginals through scholarships to university and sporting institutes for talented Aboriginals and through advanced coaching for sportspersons with exceptional skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple guiding principle of the foundation is that which motivated Polly Farmer in his own illustrious football career&mdash;the pursuit of excellence. The foundation has the strong support of the AFL, the Western Australian Football Commission, the East and West <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Perth Football Clubs and the Geelong Football Club. Graham `Polly' Farmer was a great Aboriginal footballer. In football parlance he was an ornament to the game. The foundation that now carries his name is worthy of the support of the provisions of this act and any support provided by the parliament and the public of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said about the other provisions of this legislation. I support the words of the honourable member for Werriwa in his most eloquent speech to the parliament earlier on this evening. He has drawn attention to the fact that this is a government hell-bent on saying one thing to small business and doing another. When you read the fine print in this legislation, you see that the reduction in the uplift factor applies for only one year. I am referring specifically to that provision of the legislation. What John Howard did not say&mdash;good old honest John&mdash;in the context of the election campaign was, `Once 1996-97 is through, we are going to ratchet up the uplift factor to around 10 per cent.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That measure will affect small businesses in not only my electorate but also certainly the electorates of Werriwa and Batman and all the other electorates throughout the length and breadth of Victoria. Those small businesses have already been hit by the announcements that have been made by this particular government in winding back the industry assistance measures and in the contractions that they are proposing to fiscal policy in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not seem to have dawned on the members opposite that when the government makes an expenditure decision, invariably that decision is carried out by the private sector. One example of that is the building better cities program, which was sponsored by the former Minister for Housing and Regional Development, Brian Howe, in the previous Labor government. That program sponsored some $10 million worth of expenditures on the Deakin wool stores project, which was opened recently in Geelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What people do not understand is that that particular expenditure has called forth production from around Geelong. The Deakin wool stores project was designed by Geelong <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1460"> architects, who received payment for that. The major contractor on that was a Geelong building firm, which employed through the agency of this program some 150 people on that project alone. Over the road at the Geelong transport interchange, there was some $2 million worth of expenditure and more labour employed&mdash;more Geelong small businesses receiving the benefits of those expenditures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make that point because when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) talk about fiscal responsibility in this country and about cutting back on government expenditures, they need to be aware that out in the regions the people who carry these expenditures through are invariably small and medium sized firms in the private sector. They are the ones that are going to be starved by the fiscal policies of this particular government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had dinner tonight with some business people from here in the ACT. Boy, are they disappointed with this government. These are people who do not run large businesses, but the cutbacks are really of great concern to them. They see falls in their business, contractions in their revenue, contractions in their turnover and inevitably, at the end of the day, a contraction in staffing levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you combine what is happening in the private sector with what this government is proposing in the public sector, you have a double whammy&mdash;a double hit on small and medium businesses all around this country. This was alluded to by the honourable member for Werriwa in his speech. This piece of legislation is but one of a whole range of measures designed to smack small and medium businesses right in the neck. It can have only one inevitable consequence&mdash;reduced employment levels, reduced levels of economic activity, a contraction in the Australian economy and, of course, repercussions for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need no more from King Con the Treasurer; the man who says one thing one day and then implements another thing another day. I have a few choice words for the Prime Minister which I am sure you would rule out of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The uplift factor measure that the Prime Minister <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is introducing in this legislation, ratcheting it back up to 10 per cent in the out years, will come back to haunt him. He will be known forever as Dishonest John, the Prime Minister who drove the boot into small business in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend to other members in this House the amendment that has been proposed by the honourable member for Werriwa. He eloquently stated that the fiscal policies of this government will have a damaging effect on small business. He also referred to the trade practices legislation, which is going to affect small business, and to the way in which this legislation is going to penalise small business. He made a very eloquent appeal to this House, which I reinforce here tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am often intrigued by government ministers who waddle up to the dispatch box to support the Prime Minister's concept of the black hole in the budget. I have one simple question to put to those ministers: if they regard a $4 billion deficit in 1996 as an economic disaster and they lambast the former finance minister and now the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) for that, how do they view an $8 billion deficit caused by the then Treasurer, John Howard, in 1983? You can come to only one conclusion: that particular deficit was foisted on the Australian economy by an economic imbecile. It was accompanied by double digit inflation, double digit unemployment, an economy in reverse, job shedding, and industrial disputation at an all&hyphen;time high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) waddles up to the dispatch box and has a crack at the Leader of the Opposition for a purported deficit, but what would he say about a deficit in current terms of $24 billion and the Treasurer who incurred it? I leave you with that particular question tonight. I support the amendment that has been proposed by the honourable member for Werriwa in this debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 is an important bill for the new government because it contains the change of rate to the provisional uplift factor, an important election promise to unincorporated small business and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1461"> smaller investors, and gives some inkling as to the future development of coalition taxation policy. I, along with the rest of the community and this House, I am sure, will be observing these developments very closely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having been a critic&mdash;trenchant at times&mdash;of the previous government's abysmal record in the area of taxation, I will certainly be doing what I can to hold the new government to account by those very same standards. In fact, the coalition has got a lot more to live up to. The rhetoric of oppositions has always been tempered by the move to the treasury bench, but it is hardly an excuse for backtracking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet on many grounds, the coalition has a great deal to heed in the areas of tax simplification, reducing the cost of compliance, restricting the revenue hungry spread of the fringe benefits tax, applying commonsense to the provisional tax uplift factor, providing capital gains tax rollover relief, and so the list goes on. The coalition has promised much. The coalition has raised the expectations of many businesses that it will pursue with some vigour the matters to which I have just referred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill deals with three matters, namely: share buybacks, deductions for gifts, and the reduction of the provisional uplift factor. The share buybacks and gift measures were introduced into the parliament late last year in the previous government's Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1995. This bill will give effect to the 1995-96 budget announcement by the Labor government that the full buyback price of a share in an off&hyphen;market share buyback is treated as consideration for ordinary income and capital gain purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Relief from double taxation is provided by reducing the amount of the ordinary income gain, or capital gain, by the amount of the dividend included in assessable income or paid out of profits. If the dividend is rebatable, it will not create or increase a capital loss or an allowable deduction. A market value rule is also to apply to off&hyphen;market share buybacks. Any excess over the market value of a share, that is, a dividend, will not be frankable under these provisions. The amendments will apply to share buybacks <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that take place after 7.30 p.m. AEST on 9 May, unless they occur under certain transitional arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims the amendments have the potential to prevent a future loss to its revenue. However, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) should not lose sight of the fact that a harmonised tax policy should not necessarily equate to a protection of the government's revenue base. The Keating government, as you probably remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, became expert at milking the small business community for every cent it could. Let that be a lesson for the new coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely the very reason for the existing rate of the provisional tax uplift factor needs to be revisited. Interest rates and inflationary expectations have fallen considerably since the eight per cent figure was envisaged by Labor and applied in a completely indiscriminate way then. It assumes that a provisional taxpayer's income will increase by the percentage stipulated, when in fact that income could rise or fall by an amount well outside the range of six per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The historical reason for having an uplift factor, which is for the purpose of assessing provisional tax obligations, has been overlooked or well and truly superseded in the rationales of successive governments. An uplift factor to provisional tax assessments once allowed the Taxation Office merely to keep pace with inflation. In the immediate past, this parliament legislated under Labor to give the government the discretion to increase the uplift factor to as much as 12 per cent. The coalition now proposes to give it the option of increasing it to up to 10 per cent. I argued against it when Labor introduced the measure, and I remain consistent in my opposition to the government having a discretionary tax at its disposal. I will get back to that later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1462"> Eight per cent, six per cent or any figure in excess of the forecast rate of inflation this year amounts to nothing more than an unreasonable tax grab. The history of and logic for an uplift factor has been totally ignored. It simply becomes another way of wringing a little more out of our taxpayers in the private business sector and, in particular, the propri etors of unincorporated small businesses and small investors, including self-funded retirees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know, small business is the sector of our community which probably plays the most important role in creating real wealth and employment in this country. It might be arguable, but it is certainly up there in the top four. By employing 47 per cent of Australia's total work force and creating 30 per cent of the nation's wealth, small business has already demonstrated that it is the engine room for jobs growth in this country. If every small business could afford to employ just one extra person, our pool of unemployed would disappear. How many times have we heard that during the election campaign?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of mitigating the effect of the uplift factor, the only available means to the taxpayer is by applying for a provisional tax variation from the Australian Taxation Office. That fails to rectify the situation because it greatly increases the exposure of taxpayers to penalties and back taxes if they should misjudge their likely income for the financial year ahead. At 15 per cent&mdash;the variation now allowed since 1992 without penalties&mdash;it is more than a bit tight. Such penalties can easily wipe out the benefits of a possible provisional tax variation. So many people are trapped into paying provisional tax and will have to recoup any overpaid tax at the end of the financial year. The ATO gets it both ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any provisional tax uplift factor will inevitably be an arbitrary imposition. The only way in which the arbitrariness can be reduced is if it is kept at the lowest possible rate and if taxpayers are given a fair margin of error in calculating a provisional tax variation. The uplift factor remains a hindrance that the business community could very well do without. Given that we have it, the uplift factor should be linked to the forecast rise in the consumer price index or gross domestic product, but not both. The only problem for the government is that this makes a mockery of its six per cent figure. Average earnings have sometimes been quoted as being relevant, but there is no logical basis for that in this context.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The revised budget estimates released by the Treasurer on 17 April this year show estimated gross domestic product growth of 3.25 per cent in 1995-96 and 3.25 per cent again the following financial year, with the figure never rising above four per cent through to 1998-99. The consumer price index growth for 1995-96 has been forecast upward from four per cent to 4.75 per cent. However, for the next three financial years CPI growth is predicted not to rise above four per cent. Incidentally, increases in average earnings over the next three years will also be around the four per cent mark, according to official forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, an uplift factor of no more than four per cent is warranted by each of the possibly relevant economic measures. If linked to average business growth, or even the CPI, the uplift factor would not be so arbitrary and it might, on the face of it, display some semblance of fairness. Small business is also negatively affected by the uncertainty and complexity of the tax laws passed under previous Labor governments. It is shameful that the private sector, especially unincorporated small business, is now to be slugged with an uplift factor of up to eight per cent before this bill passes the parliament, which was above the then current rate of inflation and exceeded the projected rate of returns on most investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By maintaining such an unrealistic uplift factor, the Keating government caused unnecessary cash flow problems for unincorporated small businesses, and that was that sector's reward for the part it played in creating 30 per cent of the nation's real wealth. Small business, as has been said ad nauseam, is the key to recovery of the Australian economy. It has already proven its capacity to generate jobs growth by employing 40 per cent of the national work force. Small business needs to be encouraged to continue to create wealth and consequential employment by fair and consistent tax legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reducing the provisional uplift factor to six per cent for the 1996&hyphen;97 year of income, the Treasurer is hopefully sending a message to the business community, that message <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1463"> being that the Howard government is committed to a review of the complicated and costly tax laws which hinder business growth. The Treasurer has a lot of ground to cover to restore the faith of the business sector in government, and unfortunately the amendments we are addressing today do not go far enough in doing just that. As I stated in June 1995, I think the Treasurer is being unduly generous to the revenue by insisting that the uplift factor should be at six per cent when we have a headline inflation rate of only four per cent. How did the Treasurer calculate his sums to arrive at the figure of six per cent when real GDP is set to increase at a rate of only 3&frac34; per cent for this year and for the following financial year? What rationale did the Treasurer rely on to decide on an uplift factor of six per cent when average weekly earnings are set to increase by less than four per cent for the next two years? If it has to be anything, the uplift factor should be around four per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the proposed reduction of the uplift factor by two per cent is a token gesture to the unincorporated business community and to investors such as self&hyphen;funded retirees. I say that because the financial gain to business is nominal when one considers not only the scope of the decrease but also that those who stand to gain from it are more likely to be individuals and sole traders and not the total small business community. I would like to use a quote now:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition believes that the uplift factor should be set at a realistic level which is more consistent with expected rates of income growth and inflation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not my words but those of the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the now Treasurer. His view then was in keeping with views voiced by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants and the Economic Review Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore disturbing and confidence sapping to see the stipulation in this bill that after the 1996&hyphen;97 year of income the uplift factor could, at the whim of the government, jump to as much as 10 per cent, unless the parliament provides otherwise in the meantime, and the parliament will only be able to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provide otherwise in the meantime if the measure is brought forward by the government. While the Treasurer has made reference to the parliament's right to increase the uplift factor, we must uphold the principle of no taxation without representation, and that is what this provision breaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my knowledge, the uplift factor as proposed is the only area of taxation which can be increased by the government without prior debate in the parliament about the actual extent of the increase. If the parliament sanctions the right of the executive government to increase any tax without the parliament first having the opportunity to debate it, we will be allowing just another nail in the coffin of our relevance as both individual representatives and as a parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have several other concerns which relate to the bill. If the Treasurer is as confident about his and his government's ability to manage inflation and inflation rates, as he would have us believe, why is there a provision for the uplift factor to increase to 10 per cent after 1997? Is this a warning that the government expects the CPI to escalate to within the vicinity of 10 per cent sometime over the nominal term of this government, or is it merely an ambit claim?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also ask whether the present government is truly committed to long-term growth in small businesses. If it is, why hasn't it proposed that the uplift factor be reduced immediately to a logically arguable four per cent? As has already been pointed out, an uplift of four per cent is, after all, more in line with current projected increases in either the consumer price index or GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), amongst other things, mount his argument for an amendment to maintain the uplift factor at six per cent. I support the amendment that they propose to move at the consideration in detail stage&mdash;but, I say unequivocally, not for the reasons advanced by the honourable member for Werriwa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument from the honourable gentleman went along the lines that they promised six per cent so that is what it should be forever. That is an argument which simply cannot be sustained. There is no tax rate set <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1464"> in this place which cannot be changed subsequently given the conditions of the day. It would be tantamount to taking the top marginal PAYE rate of 49c and saying that we will set it at 49c for a couple of years but that we would like to have the right after that to increase it to 60c if we are so of a mind. That is taxation without representation. It leaves with the executive government the right to set tax rates without first referring them to this chamber and to the parliament as a whole. I know the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said six per cent represents a more realistic figure for the uplift factor.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only tax I know of which increases automatically&mdash;apart from taxes which the revenue benefits from in terms of bracket creep&mdash;is the fuel excise tax, but that is enshrined in law and there is a formula for that to increase once a year in accordance with growth in the CPI. That would be perfectly acceptable if it were applied to this measure. As I have said, average weekly earnings have very little to do with this, but the measure should be either business growth or growth in the CPI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I favour the latter, but I would settle for either. It does not matter as long as it is there and constant. If it is to be six per cent, and left at that, as the opposition proposes to move, that is entirely supportable, but not for the reasons advanced by my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa. If it is set at six per cent, it is then open to the government, as it does with all taxes and all tax rates, to come before this parliament and move to increase it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous government opposed dropping eight per cent down to six per cent last year. The hypocrisy of the whole argument is that, when you go back to 1991 and 1992 and have a look at what the nominal rates were, you find that Labor set the provisional tax uplift factor at 10 per cent when the growth in income subject to provisional tax was negative in both years. It was minus 4.1 per cent in 1990-91 and minus three per cent in 1991-92. What did you do? You put up the figure to 10 per cent. What an outrageous argument you gave to this parliament here tonight!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that, but the member for Werriwa came in here and talked about broken promises. Let us go back to the 1993 election. Labor promised not to put up taxes. What did we find? The total cost of Labor's dishonesty to Australian families was $7.3 billion. They increased company tax. They went to the 1993 election with the company tax rate at 33 per cent; after they were elected it went up to 36 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have a look at fringe benefits tax. I can remember the former Prime Minister bringing that in. He talked about $200 million or $300 million being raised. Now it is $3&half; billion being raised by the fringe benefits tax. They are the sorts of taxes that the previous government brought in for the Australian people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I was rudely interrupted, I was commenting on the extra taxation which the previous government brought in after the 1993 election. There is no doubt that the previous government went to the election in 1993 with a commitment not to put up taxation, yet that is exactly what they did after the election, for example, with sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember one particular illustration which has to do with cars. At that stage we were proposing to bring in a GST at 15 per cent. What did the government of the day then do? They said, `We'll bring back sales tax to 15 per cent on cars.' A few months after the election, what did the tax go to? First of all, it went up to 21 per cent in June, up six per cent, and then in July it went up another one per cent. So it went up to 22 per cent.</PARA>

That is not what you did. You put out a press release trying to confuse the community and obfuscate between the default rate and the provisional uplift factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) is quite right: there needs to be some rationale to the uplift factor. You are saying, `All right, we're going to bring it down to six per cent. It doesn't really matter what the economic circumstances are, we are going to have it at six per cent.'

He says, `Oh, in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1466"> three-year cycle it is going to be $540 million. It is a $540 million con. It is a lie.' The member is trying to get attention in this press release by just upping the figures and making it look grand. In actual fact, it is not on. It is just not working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member is really concerned because he is part of a party which, after the 1993 election, put up taxes. He is just trying to load that off on to the new government by saying that they are going to do the same. Our promise was that we would cut the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent, and we are delivering on that. We are going to have a look at the uplift factor in future years, depending on the circumstances. That will be adjusted as is appropriate.</PARA>

The member for Curtin has also foreshadowed an amendment, proposing to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to four per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 9), omit "6%, substitute "4%".</PARA>
<PARA>As I have already indicated in my speech on the second reading, I propose that a four per cent uplift factor be substituted for the government's proposed six per cent. I will not go over the whole diatribe again but merely summarise by saying there is no logical basis for the six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figure is not, as some innocent bystander might suspect, the equivalent of the expected increase in the consumer price index in the coming year or the equivalent of the expected increase in the gross domestic product in the coming year. It is merely a figure plucked out of the air. There is no basis for it. There is no recognised measure which would sustain an amount of six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, did make an accurate point. He said, `That is what we promised to do during the election, so that is what we are going to do.' I want to make it clear that, in the interests of logic, the figure should be in the vicinity of four per cent. It works out anyway. If you add projected growth of CPI and GDP together over the coming year and divide it by two, the average is around four <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent. The growth of each on its own is four per cent or less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only logic&mdash;this is borne out by the remark of the parliamentary secretary in summing up the second reading debate&mdash;is that it is two per cent less than Labor's figure. That is all it has going for it. Businesses generally, small businesses in particular and unincorporated small businesses that are going to have to meet the impost could reasonably expect that their tax uplift factor for provisional tax purposes would not exceed normal growth. This is a perfectly rational approach and one the government does not seem willing to accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no logic for the six per cent figure proposed by the government, except that that is what it promised to do. Therefore, the only logic left is that the government's figure is less than Labor's figure and that it is the product of a revenue hungry government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment I propose does have a logical basis, as I have explained already. It is approximate but is at least above the estimated percentage of growth in either the consumer price index or gross domestic product over the coming year. It is consistent also with past practice. The fuel excise impost, which is adjusted once a year by a percentage equivalent to the growth in the CPI for that year, is a precedent. It is logical and it is acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is acceptable because, even though it promotes an increase in tax which does not have to be referred back to this parliament, it is set at an agreed and legislated rate by this parliament, and it is there until it is changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everything I propose is consistent and logical and would be acceptable, I am sure, to the unincorporated small business sector and to those investors such as self-funded retirees, who are going to have to meet the six per cent impost despite estimated growth in the CPI being in the vicinity of four per cent.</PARA>

<PARA>This is an amendment to keep the government honest. This is an amendment to test how seriously they take their own election promises. Earlier on we heard the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), saying that the Australian people should have known that this promise for an uplift factor of six per cent was for one year only. He is expecting the Australian people to be mind&hyphen;readers. He is expecting the Australian people to have been flies on the wall when the coalition determined the true nature of their election promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard today how the government was expecting the people of south-west Sydney to be mind&hyphen;readers, to have been flies on the wall when they worked out their airports policy for Sydney. They are now expecting small businesses and self-funded retirees throughout the country to be mind-readers. I have to point out something to the parliamentary secretary. I have highlighted&mdash;I have been doing so much highlighting today&mdash;a section of your own small business policy. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy will reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from 8% to 6%.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no qualification. There is no footnote. There is nothing in brackets which says `for one year only'. It says six per cent&mdash;full stop. At the last election you sought a mandate for three years. You made promises that the Australian people reasonably could have expected to last for three years. The expectation of 800,000 small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees is that when you said six per cent it would last for three years. You did not say it with a sunset clause that ends on 30 June 1997; you said it would last for three years. That is in black and white before the parliament in your own policy document. Not only that, but the Treasurer (Mr Costello), then just the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in the House in June last year said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition believes that the uplift factor should be set at a realistic level which is more consistent with expected rates of income growth <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and inflation. Headline inflation for the year to March is 3.9 per cent. Why then assume that an average income for a provisional taxpayer will rise by eight per cent?</PARA>
<PARA>Why then assume for the out years that provisional tax assessment rates will rise by 10 per cent? That is what the government is legislating on. I have figures here from Treasury&mdash;the same figures the Treasurer has in his briefing document; the same figures he has on his desk in parliament right now&mdash;which show that for the out years, for years beyond 1996-97, the Treasury forecast of the uplift factor is much closer to six per cent than 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The forecast is there for the out years and you have been advised by your Treasury&mdash;we know how much store the Treasurer places on those forecasts&mdash;to set a rate much closer to six per cent than 10 per cent. Why, then, have you defied that advice? You made an open&hyphen;ended policy, a three-year policy, of six per cent&mdash;full stop. You came into government and received the advice from Treasury which said, `You are talking about a permanent rate. You are introducing legislation into the parliament for a permanent rate on the uplift factor. Here is our best advice.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the best advice. The best advice from the Treasury on income subject to provisional tax for 1997-98 was 7.1 per cent. That is not within cooee of 10 per cent; it is much closer to six per cent. For 1998&hyphen;99 the forecast rate is 6.5 per cent. That is not within cooee of 10 per cent; it is much closer to six per cent. For 1999-2000 the forecast is 6.5 per cent. That is not within cooee of 10 per cent; it is much closer to six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every single small business and self-funded retiree paying their provisional tax, looking at the out years, looking at the permanent rate, would know that they are victims of a Costello con, that they are victims of another John Howard fistful of dollars, snatched back after the election for the sole purpose of deceiving the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the subject of further Treasury forecasts, the figures that the Treasurer has in his briefing folder&mdash;if he was willing to debate the matter he would have them right there on the desk&mdash;the nominal GDP forecasts for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1469"> out years from Treasury in 1997&hyphen;98 are 6&half; per cent; 1998&hyphen;99, 6&half; per cent; and 1999&hyphen;2000, 6&half; per cent. The parliamentary secretary has to ask himself&mdash;he will not need the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) to help him with this&mdash;is 6&half; per cent, on Treasury advice, closer to six or 10? You should be able to work out that it is closer to six.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis, you should be supporting the ALP amendment. Not to do so is to leave the possibility hanging over this parliament, small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees of this nation that the rate will stay at 10. You, your leader and your ministerial colleagues wax long and lyrical about the fact that you do not control the Senate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), as I indicated earlier, but not for some of the reasons he gave earlier. Perhaps I am in sympathy with the reasons he gave when moving the amendment here today. My reason for supporting the amendment goes along this line: I would not trust any government with the right to increase a rate of tax by four per cent at its discretion. I simply would not do it. I argued against it when the Labor Party legislated for the first time in that way and set the uplift factor at something like 12 per cent. I remain consistent in my views and opposition to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the executive government, by executive fiat, to be able to increase the uplift factor and therefore the tax payable by unincorporated small businesses and certain investors in this country who rely on their investment income is totally unacceptable, and it should be unacceptable to any fair&hyphen;minded person in this House. No other tax on the books can be increased in this way at the sole discretion of the executive, and it would not be allowed. I gave an example earlier. Take the top marginal PAYE tax rate of around 49c. Would this parliament give the government of the day the right to increase that to 60c at its discretion some time in the future? I do not think even coalition backbenchers would accept that. It is wrong in principle. It is taxation without representation because we simply do not get the opportunity to debate it in this place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave it at six per cent as is proposed by this amendment if you must. If you have to change it because of circumstances, do so by legislation&mdash;by coming into this parliament, by paying homage to the parliament, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicated on so many occasions prior to the last election campaign. Honour the parliament and give it a chance to influence executive government, to put it on some sort of parity. God knows we are nowhere near it at the moment. It is for that basic line of reasoning that I will support this amendment. It has nothing to do with the fact that in the run&hyphen;up to the election the coalition said that they are going to reduce the uplift factor to six per cent and therefore it should remain at six per cent for the full term of this government. It does not work that way.</PARA>

<PARA>That is what the coalition promised. It was not a qualified promise. They sought a three&hyphen;year mandate&mdash;they made a three-year promise&mdash;and we are doing nothing more than trying to keep them to that promise, to keep these people honest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition tell us about their Senate problem. My colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham) was generous enough to suggest that the Senate should be abolished, and he is happy to second the motion of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The amendment I am moving tonight is just as good, because it solves the government's Senate problem on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1470"> the uplift factor for provisional tax for the next two years. This is a government that does not control the Senate. This is a government that cannot give a guarantee to small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees that the 10 per cent permanent rate will be reduced in the out years, for 1997-98 and 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government cannot provide that guarantee to small business and self&hyphen;funded retirees, why not support the Labor Party amendment? Why not support the amendment that solves its Senate problem? It does not need to go to the extreme of abolishing the Senate. We are providing, through this amendment, the opportunity for the government to solve its Senate problem on the uplift factor for provisional tax. To do nothing leaves the rate for the out years at 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has made a series of very good points. I think he has alluded to the fact that what the coalition plans is a bit of a swindle in the out years. What they will say to small business and self&hyphen;funded retirees 12 months from now is, `We had the permanent rate at 10. We are going to bring it down to eight. Aren't you lucky?' I submit to the member for Curtin and to every other member in this House that that is contrary to the intent and the faith that they expressed in their election promise. Small business would be dudded by that act if, 12 months from now, they came in here and said, `We've had the permanent rate of 10; that's in the legislation. We're now suggesting eight because the Treasury has given us some different advice.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition says to the government is: set it at six&mdash;six for now, six for next year and six for the year after. They are the medium term projections you have received from your own Treasury department. That is the best advice that is currently available to the Treasurer (Mr Costello). I am the first to concede that if the legitimate forecast for nominal GDP growth in the out years goes up, and it is around eight per cent, then we will support an eight per cent amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Curtin has pointed out, the prospect of increased <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> growth under this government is as likely as pigs flying. He has pointed that out because they are adopting a contractionary high interest rate policy. It is very unlikely that growth will go up, that nominal GDP forecasts out of the Treasury will go up to eight per cent. But, if they do, there is no problem. I commit all my colleagues in the Labor Party to supporting an amendment 12 months from now to put it at eight per cent if this is the best advice on the forecast. But the fair and reasonable and decent thing to do&mdash;based on the advice that the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) has and on the advice that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has from his department&mdash;is to set it at six per cent. Set it at six per cent in accordance with your policy and then, if it needs to be varied later on, we will do so. Set it at six just in case you decide to do nothing&mdash;and that is always available to the government. If they decide to do nothing on this option, then it stays at 10. If your Senate problems continue and you cannot carry similar legislation through the Senate in 12 or 24 months from now, you have solved the problem. You have got it at six. That is an act of good faith and decency to the 800,000 provisional taxpayers in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is an opportunity for the government to show what it meant and what it intended when it made that promise to the people of Australia. They are on to the government, because tonight I have revealed the Treasury forecasts on this matter. The medium year out year forecasts are so much closer to six than 10. It is so much more reasonable to set the permanent rate at six. I repeat to the parliamentary secretary: if you decide to do nothing, 12 or 24 months from now, it stays at 10. That, you must confess, is a clear breach of faith and intent on your election promise. If you cannot pass the legislation through the Senate 12 or 24 months from now, it stays at 10. Again, that is an act of bad faith. Support this amendment. It is the decent thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (9.29 p.m.)&mdash;It is very interesting that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), in his opportunity to comment, did not make the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1471"> point that the default rate has been 10 per cent since 1991, under Labor. He had three opportunities to do that. He did not make one comment that it has been 10 per cent since 1991, and in 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995. Now he comes into the House and wants us to change it. It does stretch the imagination a little bit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa's argument is that the default rate was a permanent rate. He was really arguing from silence and extrapolating just to suit his own political ends. There is no other reason or basis for it. At least the contribution by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has been consistent through the years on this matter. There is no consistency in the debate which has been put to us by the opposition today. There is no consistency at all in what they were doing in government. At least we said at the election that we would reduce the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent, and that is exactly what we are doing here tonight. Under Labor the uplift factor was set at unrealistically high levels. This was merely a grab for revenue, which put extra strain on the cash flow position of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make the point again that under Labor the provisional tax uplift factor exceeded actual growth in income subject to provisional tax in each and every year between 1991 and 1994-95. The Labor government set the uplift factor at eight per cent for the last four years, including 1995-96. When the coalition moved an amendment to reduce the uplift factor to six per cent in 1995-96, what did the Labor Party do? It did not accept it. Instead it retained the eight per cent. You have come in here and changed your whole argument around, all in a matter of a few months. At that stage it penalised provisional taxpayers, small businesses and self-funded retirees. It was an absolute tax grab at that stage. We are not allowing that to happen. We are cutting it from eight per cent down to six per cent. The government will ensure that the provisional tax uplift factor in each area is set more in line with the nominal income growth to prevent the tax grab that was present under the Labor government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will be setting the provisional tax uplift factor for each year when the most accurate information is available. For 1997-98 and future income years that assessment will be made at a later date. There is a clear difference in this area. We went to the election and we made a promise that we would reduce it from eight per cent down to six per cent and we are delivering on that promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1993 election the Labor Party went to the people and said they would not increase taxation. What did they do? They went and put up taxes. We promised that we would reduce it from eight per cent down to six per cent. That is what we promised and we are delivering to the small businesses and independent retirees in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total hypocrisy of the member for Werriwa and the opposition to come and argue here about a reduction from 10 per cent down to six per cent is just to confuse. We are delivering on the promise of what we went to the Australian people with. We are cutting the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. That is more than you did in the five or six years in which this piece of legislation has been around. It was your party that was in power at that time. You have just done a total U-turn. We made a promise and we are delivering on that promise. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am opposed to what is being proposed by the opposition.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point in speaking on the Supply Bill, I want to address a number of matters in the environment portfolio. Recently, I had a visit from the North Central Catchment and Land Protection Board, which operates in part of my electorate. That part of the electorate takes in both the Loddon and Campaspe rivers and many other streams which flow in a northerly direction into the great River Murray and into the Murray&hyphen;Darling system. Ultimately, the water which emanates from the Great Dividing Range in central Victoria and flows northward through this north central region contributes to the quality of water which ultimately ends up in South Australia and provides drinking water and irrigation water to a huge area of South Australia as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The North Central Catchment and Land Protection Board has established both a vision and a mission to work towards. I met with the chairman of the board, Ted Gretgrix, who is from Bagshot just out of Bendigo, as well as a number of members of his board and also the executive officer, Shawn Butters. They informed me that the vision they have for the catchment and land protection board in the north central region is an informed and responsible community using integrated and sustainable natural resource management to enhance the economic and social development of the north central region while protecting and improving our environment. Their mission is to provide strategic leadership, advice and coordination to achieve integrated natural resource management in the north central region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very important area in many respects. I compliment the board for their fine work in this area because, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, care and protection of the environment and the quality of water supply in north central Victoria and in the Murray region is vitally important to the residents, industry and also primary industry in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also received a document from the Loddon catchment water quality strategy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under the national landcare program. This particular body is interested in water quality, another very important water issue. It takes in the care and protection of the Loddon River, which flows right through to the Murray. The important aspect of it is the way it ensures the water quality is improved, the land surrounding all of this catchment area is managed and the landcare groups and salinity management groups are linked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Salinity is a very major issue for anyone farming in that north central region of Victoria. The salinity management groups work in extremely well with every level of government&mdash;that is, local government, state government and federal government. They are reliant upon those three levels of government for funding at various levels to assist them in the fine work they do undertake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that caused great concern in that area over the last few years was the blue-green algae which was appearing in many of the streams. It has become a major problem. There have been spectacular explosions of algal blooms in some of those streams. Some of the blooms are potentially toxic species and, in many instances, affect the water quality to such an extent that even withdrawing the water from a stream and boiling it still does not remove the toxins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This algae is of great concern to the small communities within the catchment area and within the usage area of that stream as they have to ensure the quality of water is not detrimental to the residents of that area. The Loddon catchment area strategy addresses that problem. It is endeavouring, with assistance from the three levels of government, to ensure that the water quality of that area is protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also another problem; that is, the levels of nutrients which are going into those streams as well. Many of those nutrient levels contain nitrogen and phosphorus. There is always a certain amount of this occurring naturally in the area, but the levels are becoming particularly high and are causing quite a bit of concern. Some of it comes from domestic waste water, urban stormwater areas and industrial waste water, and some of it comes from the intensive animal industries. So it is a problem which has brought a lot of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1474"> attention to it because of the high toxic level of some of those algal blooms which are occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A strong effort is being made by all of the authorities to try to reduce the discharge from waste water treatment plants into the waterways in an effort to try to improve the quality of the water. The tertiary effluent treatment of sewage has also been introduced, but there are still many small townships without any form of sewerage. In many instances, they are reliant upon septic tanks. They do at times spill and seep into some of the water streams, and that adds to some of the difficulties that do occur in the quality of the water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been addressed under the federal government country towns water management improvement program, which has a rather cute acronym&mdash;COWMIP. It has been a project which has done some excellent work in many of the small country townships throughout Australia, producing small sewerage systems that are generally not able to be effected by the local community. But, with state government assistance, a bit of local government assistance and federal government contribution, a sewerage system can be introduced to replace what has been an old septic system. Of course, an effort has been made to improve the quality of the water. But none of these things can be done without the necessary dollars, and there are many of these environment programs that will need to be attended to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is necessary to improve the river flow management as there is a lot of watercourse bank erosion, which is often caused by excessive flows of water. The inroads it makes into the banks and the lack of attention it may receive can erode significant areas and change the whole course of a waterway. That erosion can take away valuable soil from the farming pursuits on either side of the watercourse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important, from an environmental point of view, to have adequate flows of water to the wetlands areas. Some of those wetlands areas are very important ecologically to sustain life. They are very important to the processes of the flows into the Murray River and they improve the ecology of that river as well. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also has a significant impact on fishing. Throughout those Victorian streams we have the major problem of the European carp infestation, which does untold damage to many of those streams because of its peculiar feeding habits. It feeds on the bottom of a river and continually churns up the base of the river. It eats all of the feed on the bottom of the river and then turns it into mud. It can pollute the water streams and, of course, cause extreme difficulties for all of the native fish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was with this in view that the Australian Recreational and Sport Fishing Confederation Inc. came to see me just a week ago. It is one thing that is very important to the recreational fishing people. I understand that there are over 4&half; million recreational fishers in Australia, so it is one of the biggest sports and certainly one of the biggest recreations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They would like to see a system of adequate funding for recreational fishing administration, representation and management, and for fish habitat, resource conservation and management; an immediate allocation of funding to implement the goals and principles of the national recreational fishing policy; a commitment to fund a survey of recreational and sport fishing in Australia every five years; a restriction of foreign longlining in Australia's exclusive economic zone; and no commercial taking of billfish in the Australian fishing zone. The Minister for Administrative Services, the member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who is at the table, probably understands more about the billfish than us southerners. Certainly, he would understand that very clearly and would believe that it should be declared a recreational species only. I want to commend this organisation to members of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recreational fishing is a big industry. As well as having a number of devotees, the sport is a big industry when you think of all the equipment that is involved&mdash;the fishing gear, the boats and the recreational items that are required when you go fishing. It is a sport for all of the family. I can only commend it to the members of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to talk about a particular stream in my electorate, the Bendigo Creek. There has been extensive publicity about this creek <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1475"> because of the question mark which hangs over it and its ability to dispose of chemical and toxic waste. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bendigo Advertiser</EMPHASIS> recently ran a very big feature on this and headed up some of the problems that were involved and the need for the Environment Protection Authority of the Victorian state government and the federal government to take an active interest in this, along with the landcare groups and all of the local government bodies that border that creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a stream that emanates from Bendigo in the catchment area and finds its way right through Kow Swamp to Kerang, ultimately finding its way into the Murray River. This is a real problem that needs attention. I am delighted that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bendigo Advertiser</EMPHASIS> sought to look at reasons why this creek was polluting so many areas, tried to look at the reasons behind it and tried to find a strategy in conjunction with all of the groups&mdash;including the Loddon catchment area body and also with state government and federal government&mdash;to address that question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the problem of liquid waste. Some of it can be discharged to that creek and can be handled okay, but a lot of it needs to be handled by private firms who would remove some of that waste water and treat those toxic chemicals in the manner in which they should be treated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these issues concerning the environment are extremely important for all of north central Victoria because of the impact that they have on so many farms, the contribution to salinity, the impact that it has on the Murray&hyphen;Darling system and the salt load that goes in there. But there is another issue that I would briefly like to touch on, and it is what is known as the Northern Mallee pipeline project, which is to the north of my electorate. Some of the streams in my area, and some of the water that ultimately finds its way into the northern area of my electorate, are associated with this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Mallee pipeline program project is an infrastructure project with diverse and enduring benefits which are very much broader than just water supply improvement. The dramatic water savings from both the total project and the individual stages <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> directly translate to a number of major improvements in the area. They assist in the establishment of minor and major industrial and commercial developments. I might add that this scheme, when completed, will save 65,000 megalitres of water each year. That is probably enough water to keep the whole city of Bendigo and its 85,000 residents in water for a year. So you can see the incredible savings that could be achieved by piping what was once an open channel right through the Northern Mallee area. Because it was an open channel, and much of it still is, there has been a tremendous amount of wastage through evaporation, drainage and spoilage of the quality of the water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a saving of 65,000 megalitres of water per annum, it would be a major breakthrough if the final stages of this Northern Mallee pipeline project were to be completed. It would mitigate the economic loss to existing farm and industrial enterprises through better drought preparedness, which is a very important topic. In 1995 that region was subjected to the second worst drought in Australian history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The project would improve on&hyphen;farm management practices and productivity. It would assist important new rural agricultural and value added enterprises. It would also provide major environmental benefits throughout the Wimmera and Mallee, extending to the Glenelg and Murray river basins, with the rehabilitation of significant lands presently lost to production because of salinity. One of the areas most seriously affected is the Kerang area. It is therefore very important that this project proceed so that land there is rehabilitated and put back into full&hyphen;scale production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This project is well worthy of federal and state government support. Back in 1992 and 1993 the federal and state governments provided $4.2 million in funds for the construction of the first of eight stages of this project. Stage two was completed in December of 1995 following a further allocation in 1994&hyphen;95 from both federal and state governments totalling $5.1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About 40 per cent of this project has been funded but there is still much to be done. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1476"> These are the sorts of programs that need to be continued because they result in tremendous savings in water and have very strong environmental impacts that include protecting land from desalinisation and putting it back into full&hyphen;scale production. But, regrettably, many of these projects cannot be funded under our existing budget. That is why our environment package is so important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment package needs to pass through the Senate to ensure that additional funds are available for projects relating to these rivers and streams. Many groups in my electorate are hoping to receive funds because of it. The North Central Catchment and Land Protection Board certainly is, and both the Northern Mallee pipeline project and Bendigo Creek could do with some more money. Without that package we will not have sufficient funds to implement a lot of these major projects in the electorate. I am sure every Australian would know of similar important projects. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Batman)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.08 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise this evening to speak about the importance of continued funding for what I regard as the most innovative labour market program put together in the history of this country. I refer specifically to Working Nation, which was first announced in 1994. I also make note of the importance of that scheme to regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the employment front, I must say that I was surprised this evening that the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) did not raise the matter of the closure of the Family Court in Bendigo and the potential loss of jobs. I mention it because one of the objectives of Working Nation was to assist those who were displaced, as a result of the restructuring of the Australian economy, to ensure that they were given meaningful employment and training opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the innovative nature of Working Nation, historically up until the late 1980s the approach to unemployment in Australia was to basically adopt the view that a person who was unemployed would be unemployed for a short duration and was therefore entitled to a system of relief. In the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> late 1980s, it became clear to the Australian government and, for that matter, to industry at large that there were particular groups in the Australian labour force that required specialist attention. That therefore resulted in the development of JET&mdash;jobs, education and training&mdash;which was, in many instances, for single parents who had been out of the work force for varying periods, often unfortunately lengthy in nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also put together the first program aimed at trying to assist the long-term unemployed, namely, newstart. I am pleased to say that in 1994 the Australian community adopted the view that in relation to many of the long-term unemployed, in association with other groups of the Australian community who had lost jobs as a result of the restructuring of the economy with respect to the railway, the maritime industry, the manufacturing industry or whatever, there was an obligation on the government of the day to ensure that there was sufficient allocation of resources to create meaningful training opportunities as a stepping stone to gainful employment for those people. It also meant that we put in place a fairly important cornerstone. That went to a new principle&mdash;a reciprocal obligation on the basis of which every person was guaranteed a reasonable offer of employment and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other side of the coin that related to the question of reciprocal obligation represented a package of some significance. The key elements of that package, as embodied in Working Nation, included the following issues: firstly, a commitment to enhanced skills development; secondly, greater labour market program opportunities; thirdly, early intervention assistance for at&hyphen;risk short&hyphen;term unemployed; fourthly, a youth training initiative to ensure that unemployed youth under 18 years of age do not become long-term unemployed; and, fifthly and finally, a guaranteed job or suitable employment offer for those in the job context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised this issue this evening because I am exceptionally concerned about the potential loss of many of the initiatives that have had a major impact in assisting people not just in metropolitan Australia but also in regional <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1477"> Australia as a result of the Working Nation initiatives. I say in passing that in recent weeks I have had contact from a number of regional centres around Australia expressing concern about the attitude of the current government to the Working Nation programs and in doing so highlighting their successes and perhaps, more importantly, their worries about the future of those programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said in my first speech to parliament that one of the major issues confronting the Australian community at the moment was a requirement by government, in association with the community at large, to try to put some security back into people's lives. I would argue that Working Nation was about trying to put some security back into people's lives. I say that because, for whatever reason, the Australian community decided that we had to restructure the Australian economy. That effectively meant that many people, be it in the textile, clothing and footwear industry, the railway industry or a variety of other industries, lost jobs that they would have expected to hold for the rest of their working lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis, I refer to contact recently made to my office in Batman in the northern suburbs of Melbourne by people such as Jim, Vahida and Tracey. I have also received faxes and letters from Fiona, Julia, Tahtali, Theresa, Garry and Yeh. I will tell you why all of them are making contact. They are exceptionally worried about what will happen to their job opportunities if the current government, led by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), shuts down the labour market programs that have had so much success in recent months. I have also received calls from Perth, from the Hunter region and from Cairns&mdash;from people hoping that I can help them get back into training, get into a labour market program, which will get them meaningful long-term job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They want my help because they have been told by the local CES office, on the instruction of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), that the labour market skills training tap is being slowly turned off. They are effectively being told that nothing more is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> available. They are being told that it is drying up so quickly, under instructions from Senator Vanstone and Dr Kemp, that after Friday&mdash;if nothing new is heard&mdash;Skillshare groups around Australia expect to start handing out redundancy and termination notices to their 10,000 employees on the advice of the National Skillshare Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is these types of decisions that I believe had a serious impact on the recent elections in the state of New South Wales. I think of the poor performance by the National Party in the seat of Clarence and the seat of Orange. I know that because in the northern suburbs of Melbourne and Northcote, for example, in my electorate of Batman, employers who have employed young apprentices and trainees under federal government programs are upset. They are seriously upset and angry with the coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, for example, more than 70 businesses in my electorate who have done the decent thing and taken on young people using the national training wage allowance that this government is now refusing to pay them. This government ought to hang its head in shame, turning its back yet again on small businesses. The Northcote CES office is having to tell employers that, even though they have been good local corporate citizens and taken on young people as trainees and apprentices, the new government will not let them pay the promised subsidies which were supported by this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One small business employer in my electorate has rung my office and said that he cannot believe what has happened to him in recent days. He has&mdash;I think he is to be congratulated and supported&mdash;doubled his work force by taking on five young trainees under the national training wage allowance. But now the CES, under the instructions of Senator Vanstone, the minister responsible, will not even pay him for his decision to try to do something constructive with respect to the all&hyphen; important issue, especially in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, of creating training and job opportunities for young unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To his credit, this employer has been ringing the CES almost daily, asking when he <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1478"> would be paid. But they cannot give him an answer because they have been given instructions to say that the money has run out. He was told, `Wait a month.' Then maybe they can pay him. This has in turn affected his cash flow, which is always tight for small business. Unfortunately, he has had to lay off two trainees in their 20s and told a third trainee that he may soon have to tell him that there is no more work because of the decision of this government. Unfortunately, this situation is being replicated all over the country with thousands of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer in passing to the fact that one of our successes under Working Nation was the creation of jobs in the small business sector of the Australian economy. In fact, over 70 per cent of jobs created under Working Nation were created in the small business sector of the Australian economy. In that context I refer to the fact that the previous government banked $140 million to ensure that there would be enough money to pay all employers and their employees if, as has happened, the demand for labour market programs outstripped the original budget for this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of using this money, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is now unfortunately playing cheap politics, telling people that there is no money available. I suggest that it is a con&mdash;the Costello con, a nasty game unfortunately hurting small businesses and their employees, some of the most disadvantaged people in the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to Bathurst in New South Wales. I refer to a program which has had a successful track record in training young unemployed for the retail industry, one of the growth areas of employment at this particular point in Australian history. The retail trainers were given less than 24 hours in Bathurst to tell its trainees that the next retail training program had been shut down by this government, even though that program had plenty of applicants lining up for the opportunity to get the skills to get a job and to gain long-term employment in the retail industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I turn to the question of reconciliation. I note that this week is National Reconciliation Week. This is a fairly sensitive issue. I be lieve there is a commitment in the Australian economy at the moment, out in the Australian community, to do something practical to assist our indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a truly sensitive move last Friday, four days before the beginning of reconciliation week, the Njernda Aboriginal Cooperative near Echuca in north&hyphen;west Victoria was rung by the local CES representative and told that there was no money for the nine trainees employed by the local co&hyphen;op. The co&hyphen;op was then told that the money for the trainees, all in the special labour market programs, may never come through. That is the government's commitment not only to the labour market but also to the question of reconciliation and trying to do something practical about indigenous people who have the highest level of unemployment in Australia at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That co&hyphen;op had taken on these trainees in good faith. One of the trainees had in fact moved from Cairns in Queensland to get training in Victoria so as to ensure that, as is the normal practice by Senator Vanstone at the moment, the finger could not be pointed at that trainee and the suggestion made that the trainee was a dole bludger. Now the CES will probably have to say, `Sorry, no money, no training, no work,' as a result of the decisions of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about Carole Artery, a pensioner. Carol is to be congratulated because she is a pensioner trying to support herself and her daughter. She tells me that at the age of 46 her only opportunity of getting the skills to get a job and get off the pension, which is her desire, has been the local Skillshare organisation. I know that many members of this House support the local Skillshare organisation and they are as worried as I am about the future of those Skillshare organisations because of the attitude of the current government. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Skillshare has given me the support and confidence. I know of other people who have done this course and now have very good jobs. If Skillshare closes, I would have a long wait to get into another course at TAFE. At my age&mdash;46&mdash;I may not get in at all.</PARA>
<PARA>Georgina Galea is also trying to get off the pension and get a job. I know it hurts the government for me to raise these issues this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1479"> evening, because I am talking about ordinary men and women out there who want to pursue practical training opportunities so as to ensure they get on the ladder to gain a proper job and avoid being called a dole bludger by Senator Vanstone and Dr Kemp. What did she have to say? She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be a shame if we have to close the centre because the government wants to save money by making us suffer.</PARA>
<PARA>Then there is the migrant woman trying to get a job and to take part in Australian society. She says if her Skillshare is closed down:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that there will not be any hope for me to work. I will try to diminish all my hopes and sit back and be content with the social security benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the coalition would have that migrant woman do. She then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope you will reconsider your decision and God helps you.</PARA>
<PARA>I only hope this evening that Senator Vanstone and Dr Kemp, the member for Goldstein, are listening. I also hope that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, is listening because I want to raise the circumstance of a 32&hyphen;year&hyphen;old chef from rural Queensland. His name is Martin. I am pleased to say he has worked for a period of 15 years as a chef but now, because of a rare disease, he cannot continue working in the kitchen and needs new skills and retraining. I thought Working Nation was about giving those people an opportunity to transfer from one industry to another if they found, because of their personal circumstances, that they were no longer able to continue in those gainful employment opportunities. Martin said to me that his only hope to get anywhere in life was to get new skills through a literacy group run by the local TAFE and paid for by CES. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is 1996 and I cannot believe that anybody does not understand how hard it is to survive without the skills so many people take for granted.</PARA>
<PARA>He has also asked my office for assistance. With respect to his other workmates who want to pursue such literacy programs, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please help us in our plight as we only have six weeks before our classes are cancelled and we are forgotten about by the coalition government. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, let me talk about Tracey. In her effort to get a job, she is doing a skillshare typing course in the day and, to her credit, a different TAFE course in the evening, to try to make sure that she is ready to pursue employment opportunities. This is what Tracey had to say to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's a pain knowing what the government and a lot of other people are saying about us: `All those unemployed people just sit at home all day, and those who don't have the experience needed don't even get out and try to get the experience needed to get a particular job.'</PARA>
<PARA>Tracey asked me, `How can we get the experience needed if you all decide to stop the funding?' Tracey also said&mdash;and I hope Senator Vanstone, Dr Kemp and Mr Costello are listening&mdash;that she did not like to be called a dole bludger. I hope you are all listening, because these are the types of men and women all around Australia&mdash;urban and regional Australia&mdash;who want to pursue practical training opportunities under Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the short break before parliament resumed, I took the opportunity to meet with those people. I met, for example, with the people at 15 Skillshare centres in Sydney. They are all sitting and wondering at the moment whether there will be continued funding to ensure that those Skillshare centres continue to make a major contribution to training and gainful employment opportunities around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People hope to get jobs. They also know that the stepping stone to decent job opportunities is practical training programs, delivered as a result of Working Nation. Working Nation was a success because we took it out of Canberra and gave it to local groups to ensure that they involved the local communities and developed programs specific to the needs of industries in their local regions. I would only hope that the current government, in seeking to pull apart the Working Nation initiatives, does not walk away from those successes and the opportunities we gave to many different people around Australia to make a significant contribution to the development of programs that met the skill requirements of industry development in the local regions. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1480">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the Australian community to listen to the stories that I have relayed to the parliament this evening. I urge members on the other side of the House to talk to some of the graduates of these programs who are now off the dole, off the pension, and who are earning good money and have self-respect. Working Nation is a success for that very reason. We put self-respect back into the Australian community because we developed programs that suit the needs and circumstances of individual people, their families and industry at large. The government is to be condemned for its activities, its short-sighted approach, its attacks on Working Nation and its failure to commit adequate resources to the ongoing implementation of the targeted Working Nation initiatives.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of people from the electorate of Lowe complained to me over the weekend that the government broke its promise to them. We heard the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) say on a number of occasions during the election campaign that there would be no planes flying over the electorate of Lowe if the people of Lowe voted for the coalition. That promise has been absolutely broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that on the weekend a number of planes flew over Enfield, Strathfield and that bottom part of the Lowe electorate. That is an absolute contravention of what the government said would happen. There has also been a substantial number of flights all over the south&hyphen;western and inner part of Sydney. Parts of Sydney that were never subjected to aircraft noise before are now being subjected to aircraft noise. There are heavy jets taking off and peeling off the flight path long before they reach the Iron Cove Bridge, which was where the Minister for Transport said the government would have those planes going to before they turned east or west. Any of the maps that Airservices Australia can provide will show that we have these spaghetti trails all over the Sydney metropolitan area now, affected by the changes that the government has made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the government was driven by ideology and sheer electoral fraud in wanting to look after themselves and hurt other people by the promises that they made during the election campaign about Sydney airport. In their manic desire to implement those policies, they have brought a lot of noise and difficulty to hundreds of thousands of people who live in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen the government in its meanderings propose an EIS on Holsworthy. The effect of that will be that the government will find itself trying to make a choice about Holsworthy or Badgerys Creek, putting off the decision to build a second airport for Sydney. The reality of that will be&mdash;as we have already seen in the newspapers in recent days with the tourism task force&mdash;demands to turn Sydney airport into a 24&hyphen;hour operation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1481"> airport and demands that we do great damage to the most beautiful city in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government wants to do something sensible about Sydney airport, it ought to look at doing something to take aircraft traffic away from that airport and move it to another airport that can service Sydney. All this stupidity about whether we will have an EIS on Holsworthy or whether or not we will go ahead with Badgerys Creek just puts off the day. As we come to the Olympic Games in the year 2000, we will find that there has been no airport built and that there are demands to do away with the curfew. Once that curfew is lost, the people of Sydney will be damned to a 24-hour operation airport for the rest of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will just become too simple for the government. I see the minister at the table, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), nodding when I say that. He is in on the plot with these people. He knows precisely what they are up to. That will not wash. He comes from a city which has the greatest white elephant ever built by the Liberal Party in civil aviation years&mdash;the Launceston airport. They are trying to cause the same ridiculous situation to happen in Sydney, but in reverse. You have an airport that no-one goes to at Launceston and an airport that too many want to come to in Sydney. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<ELECTORATE> (Moreton)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.35 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to speak about the Coopers Plains level crossing in my electorate. This is a very dangerous level crossing and an overpass should have been built there some 25 years ago. Lack of an overpass contributes to the problems which cause one of Brisbane's most congested intersections, the intersection of Boundary, Orange Grove and Beenleigh Roads at Coopers Plains. Lack of an overpass has caused small business to decline in the general Coopers Plains area and it has also, unfortunately, caused several fatalities, the most recent just a few weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This level crossing crosses the Brisbane suburban line, which has now been extended <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the Gold Coast, so it is the Brisbane&hyphen;Gold Coast railway line which is affected. Since the line has been open there have been several accidents that have caused some delays to the progress of the Gold Coast train, which, of course, goes to the heart of the viability of the entire service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I campaigned on this issue in the Coopers Plains area at the recent federal election and large numbers of people in the area supported my stand, and I note that recently the Brisbane City Council have come up with a number of band&hyphen;aid solutions&mdash;traffic light coordination and line marking for pedestrians&mdash;to try and make it safer. I am especially glad, though, that my recent campaign efforts have woken up the local Labor councillors in the area. These particular people want to be seen as doing something, but what they have come up with is certainly not the answer. Those are not my words alone. The Coopers Plains Concerned Citizens Group, including the Reverend John Case, shares my view that the ideas put forward by the Brisbane City Council are simply band&hyphen;aid solutions to a major problem and that the real response that is needed, and wanted, by the citizens in the area is an overpass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would be disturbed to know, Mr Speaker, that a coronial inquiry a few years ago into a fatality at the level crossing recommended an overpass, but the then state Labor government simply ignored the coroner's recommendations. I have written to the new coalition government in Queensland and so far, unfortunately, have been ignored by them also. It seems to me and to many residents in and around Coopers Plains that this is simply because this area is a traditionally safe Labor area. Locals thought, back in 1989 when a state Labor government was elected, that the problem would be remedied; after all, then Premier Goss had also once been the local member. But no, Labor ignored their needs. They took their votes for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, my side of politics seems to have also written off the area as one in which they cannot get a vote. The state coalition government will get plenty of votes in the Coopers Plains area if they break the never ending cycle of fobbing&hyphen;off and actually fix the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1482"> problem. I am particularly astounded that 10 weeks have passed since I wrote to the state transport minister in Queensland about this issue. Since I first wrote, another fatality has occurred at the crossing. I wrote to the minister at that time seeking a meeting on the issue, and last week I wrote to him again warning him that I would, regrettably, have to criticise him publicly for his silence on this issue. The only comment that I can find which comes close to having actually come from his own mouth was a statement to one of the local papers in my area last week by a spokesman for the minister who said it would cost $20 million to build an overpass at Coopers Plains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one in my area needs any more excuses or delays. The crossing should have been built 25 years ago when a similar crossing was built on the interstate line up the road. It was not, and the failure of successive state governments to act on this issue since then must now come to an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reject the approach of putting off this issue yet again. Today I have written to the Queensland Premier, Rob Borbidge, the leader of the Liberal Party in Queensland, Joan Sheldon, the Labor leader, Peter Beattie, the local Labor state member for Archerfield, Len Ardill, and the Labor councillor for the Acacia Ridge ward, Kevin Bianchi, and asked them to join with me to put partisan politics aside and to work together to get the sensible solution to this problem which is needed. I have asked both the Premier and the opposition leader to make the overpass for Coopers Plains party policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both sides must commit to action. We cannot afford a continuation of the long wait for action and both sides of Queensland state politics have to put aside partisan point scoring and get on with the job. As the federal member for the area, I will work with all interested people to achieve the best for my constituents, putting people ahead of politics. In simple terms: I want an end to the impasse which for decades has prevented an overpass being built.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to raise an issue that I raised earlier today: the deception of the proposed airport at Holsworthy. This afternoon, when I had a bit of time on my hands, I obtained the first preference voting in the Hughes by-election at the recent general election. I was particularly interested in the Wattle Grove area because that is where the Defence Housing Authority has put in a magnificent housing estate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to read that the Liberal candidate, who is now a member of this House, the honourable member for Hughes (Mrs Vale), received 1,228 first preference votes and the runner-up, the ALP candidate Robert Tickner, received 1,063 votes. I suggest that, if that election was repeated this coming Saturday, the 1,228 votes would not go to the Liberal candidate because people do not like the prospect of jets coming or taking off a few hundred feet above their houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, as you would know, it is important&mdash;in a former life you were a member of the Public Works Committee&mdash;that, of all the defence housing projects all around Australia, Wattle Grove is a showplace. There is absolutely no question about that. It is a magnificent estate and has been very successful. Many people have purchased houses in Wattle Grove, not just defence houses. The defence department takes only about 20 per cent of the housing. There is a mix of people. Up until last week most of those houses have been selling between $280,000 and $520,000&mdash;a considerable amount of money. Overnight, the prices of these houses have halved. People obviously do not want to live under the flight path, and Wattle Grove is right on the edge of the proposed airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot in this place about honesty in politics, how we have all got to lift our game and how standards have to be lifted. If I were a voter in the federal electorate of Hughes, especially if I had just paid $520,000 for a house in the Wattle Grove estate, I would want to know why I was not informed prior to the election of the possibility of Holsworthy becoming an airport. We in the Public Works Committee did inspect and have a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1483"> public hearing at Badgerys Creek. We also made certain recommendations concerning the infrastructure at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have had your chance. If you want to have a say, jump up when you get the call. I have always taken the view that it is pointless putting in an airport anywhere unless you have the proper infrastructure for it and that means a railroad and various other services. I was personally very concerned that that came about with Badgerys Creek.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now going into the business of deciding whether the airport is going to be at Holsworthy or Badgerys Creek. The Public Works Committee has not yet had a look at Holsworthy. I have had a look at the terrain and did my national service there&mdash;more years ago than I care to remember&mdash;and I know what it is like. Living just south of that area, I know what it is like. Also, having been somewhat involved over the last couple of years in various clean&hyphen;ups of unexploded ordnance, I know how expensive that will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going ahead with an airport at Holsworthy would be a very expensive business but not nearly as expensive for the people who have been deceived. They bought their houses in good faith in places like Wattle Grove believing that they could raise their families there. Their homes, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, have been devalued overnight.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the issue of the Internet. In days gone by, parents would often worry that their children were playing on the roads. These days the information superhighway has become that road and parents should be just as worried. One of the responsibilities we have as parliamentarians is to design and introduce laws that protect the weak and the vulnerable. There is surely nothing more vulnerable in our society than our children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that one of the most radical changes in the past year relates to the Internet. Frankly, the law in regard to copyright and other issues has not kept up with the changing environment that the Internet provides us with. Access to its information, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whilst exciting, has its ugly side. I am referring, of course, to child pornography on the Internet. Whilst this is disturbing enough, what really worries me is the fact that the Internet in a large proportion of Australian households is being used by children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently read in a magazine about a child telling his father that mowing the lawn was hard but that programming the video recorder was easy. How true. I know from experience. For a long time I have felt that governments have a responsibility to establish guidelines to protect the most vulnerable in our society; that is, as I said, our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that a chip called the V chip has been introduced in the United States. I believe that the United States Congress is looking at legislating that chip to be used in every television set. The chip allows responsible parents to program a code into the television, which means you can watch certain rated shows that have the code set by the parents. This allows parents to then monitor what programs the children are watching.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The V chip does require some technical advancements, such as digital television signals. However, the issue is that it can be done. Essentially, it is possible to have a similar chip for computers, but it is somewhat more difficult as it will require providers to indicate what sort of material they are providing via the signal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some providers are already doing this. America on Line is one that comes to mind, and other countries are considering it. One of the arguments that is presented against the V chip is that it will not be used. But we should surely give parents the choice rather than not have it available at all. Another argument is that it infringes on free speech. However, to cry `Fire!' in a crowded theatre is not freedom of speech; just as publishing child pornography on the Internet for other children to see is not freedom of speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This chip would only control the viewing of the most vulnerable in our society. Should the V chip be used in Australia, we must make sure that overseas countries are doing this by way of international treaties and common agreements. The chip costs under $2 and is relatively easy to install. The next time <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1484"> a constituent calls me with their concern and shows me the sort of graphic material that is available on their computer and how easy it is to log into these programs, I would find it irresponsible and difficult to say that we are not at least investigating the use of a chip that costs less than $2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no place for pornography for children who look to us for leadership and example. I believe it is our duty to provide security and peace of mind for those parents who are unaware that this sort of material is available through the computer network. I stress that I find the Internet fascinating and understand that it will become part of our everyday lives. However, I do object to those with devious intents subjecting our children to this pornography. I will continue to lobby for censorship of the material on the information superhighway, as to me it is the equivalent to children playing on the road.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I rise in the adjournment debate to talk about a local high school, the community of which I believe deserves commendation. Calwell High School in my electorate has decided this year, against enormous odds, to go ahead with its entry into this year's National Rock Eisteddfod Competition. This competition is an annual event in the ACT. High schools particularly and colleges participate in the competition in a very pro&hyphen;active and useful way, and students are encouraged to take part in something which is really very good for their expression. It is also good for anti-drug and anti-alcohol messages. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this year's Rock Eisteddfod, as is unfortunately the problem with many extracurricular activities this year throughout our schools in Canberra, has been caused by an industrial dispute between the local government and the ACT teachers. Unfortunately, and due to the ACT government's stubborn resistance to reaching some pay settlement in this very long and ongoing dispute, many extracurricular activities of our schools in the ACT are having to be curtailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the school community of Calwell High has got behind its student body and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> together they have managed to find the resources to go ahead and lodge their entry. The Rock Eisteddfod, which usually attracts entries from around 25 to 30 schools, this year will have entries of around 12. So Calwell High is not exactly on its own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in tough times in Canberra. People are really withholding their spending. They are, unfortunately, a bit reticent about going too far forward at the moment because they do not quite know what is ahead of them in terms of financial support or in terms of work. At a time like this within any school community the parents in that community have the fortitude to get together, to get behind their kids and support an entry into something like the Rock Eisteddfod.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is something we should commend. I would like to make particular note of the fact that Calwell High's entry this year is based on the theme `The Olympic dream: world peace through sport'. Most of the input into projects such as this comes from the kids themselves. It takes an awful lot of resources, particularly in terms of time for the parents, friends and kids themselves, to get the entry together and to get it to a level which the ACT is now used to seeing. Rock Eisteddfod competitions in the past have reached an incredibly high level. I am assured&mdash;and I feel very confident in saying this&mdash;that the Calwell High School entry will not disappoint us at all but will be of an incredibly high level and standard. As I said a moment ago, Calwell High is not on its own. There are around 10 or 11 other schools doing the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate in Tuggeranong there is very grave and severe concern about finance, employment and financial income for families, and it is our newer suburban area where a lot of young families exist and where a lot of double income families rely on every dollar they can get. Yet this school community has got itself together and is raising money outside its own normal efforts of raising money to exist as a school. It is doing everything it can to get this entry together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put on the record in this place my congratulations and my good wishes to everybody at Calwell High and to everybody in any other school community in the ACT <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1485"> who is doing likewise. At the same time, I implore the ACT government to get off their seats and do everything they can to help resolve what has been an ongoing dispute of far too long which deserves to be solved quickly.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I never sought any personal gain from that particular speech, and I acknowledge that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Government is aware that there has been some concern in the past about the adequacy of local news services following the aggregation of television markets and the affiliation of regional television services with metropolitan networks.

These are not considered to be more stringent than the appointment conditions which apply to ATSIC Commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act also includes provisions for the termination of the appointment of Commissioners (section 40) and the CEO (section 53). There are considerable similarities between the matters for which Commissioners or the CEO may have their appointments terminated. The few differences which do exist between the provisions reflect the different status and roles of Commissioners and the CEO. Of greatest significance is that 17 of the 19 Commissioners are democratically elected to represent the interests of their constituents, whereas the CEO is appointed to manage the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day administration of the Commission, in accordance with any policies determined, and any directions given, by the Commission in writing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When considering the provisions for termination of Commissioners, it is important to note that, under subsection 40(6) of the Act, if an elected Commissioner ceases to be a member of a Regional Council, otherwise than by resigning from the Regional Council, their appointment as a Commissioner may be terminated by the Minister. Sections 121, 122 and 122A of the Act include provisions by which people may cease to be members of Regional Councils by means other than resignation.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
