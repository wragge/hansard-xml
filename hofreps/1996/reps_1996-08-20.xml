<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The disgraceful and totally unjustifiable episode that occurred yesterday afternoon in this Parliament House is one of the most shameful in this nation's history. I am sure I speak for members on both sides of this House when I say that the opportunity for law-abiding citizens to express by peaceful protest, by orderly and non-violent demonstration or by other acceptable means their dissent from decisions made by governments is acknowledged as one of the fundamental privileges in a free and democratic society. However, it is the responsibility of all of us to ensure it is a privilege that is not abused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened in this place yesterday should never have happened. Those responsible for transforming what was meant to be a well&hyphen;organised demonstration into the ugly and violent display that ultimately eventuated deserve the strongest condemnation. Members should be aware that every endeavour had been made to ensure that this pre-budget <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> protest activity would proceed in an acceptable and reasonable manner. There were a number of meetings between Parliament House security authorities, the police and representatives of the demonstrators prior to yesterday's rally and it had been hoped that these discussions would assist in promoting peaceful protest action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly, by way of background, on 4 July the ACT Trades and Labour Council wrote to the President and me about a rally to be staged at Parliament House on Monday, 19 August and requested permission to conduct a march around the building. We responded to that request on 24 July. We approved the protest and the march around the building subject to the following conditions: that the march not start earlier than 1.35 p.m. and be completed by 2.25 p.m.; that marshals be appointed and clearly identified to cooperate with the police in managing the march to ensure minimal disruption to traffic flows and access to the building for emergency and other vehicles; that all efforts be made by participants in cooperation with marshals and the police to ensure that roadways leading from Parliament Drive to the building and entrances to the underground car parks remain unobstructed so as not to prevent the free movement of vehicles and people in and out of Parliament House; and that the march be contained to Parliament Drive.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were subsequent discussions with representatives of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and the Aboriginal community. All concerned were advised of the approved march and agreed to contain their activities to the authorised event. Most regrettably, this agreement was broken and the conditions were not adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The protest rally remained peaceful until about 12.20 p.m. when a separate group of marchers entered the parliamentary precincts. This group refused to accept police direction, forced a breach in the police lines and ran towards the main entrance of Parliament House. Unfortunately, it was apparent that some of these demonstrators were affected by alcohol. This group was supported by participants from the more general demonstration who were incited to join those involved in riotous behaviour by a speaker from the official platform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Police formed a protective line along the perimeter of the Great Verandah, which was subsequently forced back to the main doors. The police line was withdrawn from this area due to the level of violence being experienced by officers and then redeployed to an area inside the front doors in support of parliamentary security personnel. This deployment stabilised the situation for a short period. However, demonstrators using increasing force broke through the first line of doors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once inside this area, demonstrators used weapons including a large hammer, wheel brace, steel trolley and stanchion torn from the external doors to break open the internal doors. Simultaneously, a second group of demonstrators used other weapons to break into the Parliament House shop but were held at the internal doors. The shop was ransacked by demonstrators and major damage was caused by persons who subsequently occupied the area. After some two hours, the demonstrators were finally repelled from Parliament House and driven back onto the forecourt area and, shortly afterwards, dispersed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the events which took place at the front entrance to the building, incidents also occurred on the Members Terrace, the roof of the Great Verandah and the Queens Terrace. There were 197 Australian Federal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3222"> Police on duty at the start of the demonstration in addition to the Australian Protective Service officers and parliamentary security personnel. A further 60 Australian Federal Police reinforcements were called out under established contingency plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outrageous events which took place yesterday resulted in not only financial but, more importantly and lamentably, human costs. So far about 90 personnel have reported injuries including lacerations, sprains and head and eye injuries and I understand one person remains in hospital. An initial indicative estimate of the damage to the forecourt and the foyer is upwards of $75,000. Emergency repairs have already been completed. The full extent of the looting and criminal damage which resulted from the occupation of the Parliament House shop has yet to be determined. Nine persons were arrested and have been charged with a variety of offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to commend the Parliament House security staff, Australian Protective Service officers and Australian Federal Police officers for ensuring that the building essentially remained secure. I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of several other members of staff who were called upon unexpectedly to provide assistance in the initial stages of the disturbance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I want to pay tribute to the Parliament House nurses. They performed in a most commendable and professional manner, treating approximately 40 injured personnel on the floor of the foyer. I also want to mention that the nurses were assisted in their efforts by our colleague Trish Worth and by an anonymous woman, presumably with nursing experience, who had been showing some American visitors around the Great Hall when the violence erupted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The President and I have asked parliamentary security officials to undertake an urgent and detailed review of the management of similar demonstrations in the future. We expect to receive this report shortly. I am aware that there has been some comment about reductions in parliamentary security staffing. These reductions essentially involved the closure of security points, and I do not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believe that they affected in any way the situation yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a more positive note, I want to advise members that the Parliament House shop will reopen on Wednesday, 21 August as originally planned. I hope Bill Podmore and his staff will receive the support they deserve. They were stoic under enormous pressure yesterday, but they are already up and running with plans in hand for what will hopefully be a once only and never to be repeated giant sale of damaged stock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to take this opportunity to remind members of their obligations in regard to visitors. Members are responsible for the conduct of any visitors they sign into Parliament House and this responsibility is not one that should be taken lightly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to apologise most sincerely to the Australian people and those from overseas who were visiting Parliament House and were unfortunately involved, inconvenienced, frightened or shocked in any way by this deplorable incident. To them I say: what you witnessed here yesterday is not typical of Australia or Australians, and I believe I speak for all my colleagues when I say we hope and pray it never will be.</PARA></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT>

On behalf of the government, I want to endorse everything you have said about what happened yesterday. It was very unpleasant, very unhappy and, for the people involved&mdash;the Australian Federal Police and Parliament House staff whose responsibility it was to deal with this incident&mdash;a very frightening experience and not an experience I would want any of them to go through again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already personally thanked on behalf of the government&mdash;and I now do so on behalf of the people of Australia&mdash;all of the police officers and Parliament House staff. I had the opportunity of speaking to an assembly of them with you yesterday. It is appropriate on an occasion like this to remark again, and very forcefully, that although the police services of this country come in for a lot of criticism, and although in some areas that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3223"> criticism on occasions may be justified, they do have, on occasions when they are needed, an unenviable job. Nobody should ever diminish in any way the unpleasant character of police work. On occasions like this, when we all owe them something, we ought to remark on how much in debt the Australian community is to its police services.</PARA><!-- <ERROR>Class: 1

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The policies that we were elected to implement will be implemented. I will never argue against the lawful right of Australian citizens to assemble and to voice their views in a strong and lawful manner against anything that is done by any Australian government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is utterly disingenuous of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to pretend that it can <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accept no responsibility at all for what happened yesterday.

The pathetic attempts by the President and the Secretary of that movement to evade that responsibility do not wash with the Australian people.</PARA>

I do not think anybody can for a moment pretend that those who organised yesterday's rally, those who used inflammatory language, those who exceeded reasonable political criticism, can completely escape responsibility for what occurred.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On indulgence, Mr Speaker, I am very happy indeed to speak in disassociation as suggested by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) because I did it yesterday. I did it repeatedly yesterday. There is absolutely no way any member of parliament or anybody of any decency or goodwill in the community can, under any circumstances at any time, condone, support or give comfort to violence in relation to any form of political activity in a democracy&mdash;none. We made that point absolutely clear yesterday when invited <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3224"> to do so&mdash;indeed, prior to being invited to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also appreciate the Prime Minister's remarks supporting a robust democracy which invites the public to express themselves not simply at the ballot box but also in an appropriate, peaceful, lawful political fashion in public discussion; minimising, via that process, disruption to the activities of this parliament and, of course, ensuring by that process that nobody suffers from any act of violence and ensuring the obligation to contain any act of violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with you, Mr Speaker, in your words of praise to the Federal Police, the attendants and the nurses. I was not aware that we also owe a debt to Trish Worth, but I join you in praising the efforts that she obviously made to assist people who had been injured in the melee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, too, rang the deputy police commissioner yesterday to inquire as to the fate of the police officer who was lamentably placed in hospital as a result of ruthless acts. I was comforted to hear that she is doing well, as the Prime Minister noted today from his visit to her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am afraid, however, that, whilst this action was unique in its violence, it was not unique in its disruption. I have been in this parliament for 15 years now and I am afraid I have seen too frequent occasions such as this. When I was first elected to parliament we had the situation where demonstrators broke in as far as Kings Hall in Old Parliament House. We were sitting in question time, I recollect, and could hear the chanting from there. We have had more recent examples of that. Last year we had, of course, a blockade of the parliament which prevented services coming into the place. That affected the capacity of the parliament to perform its tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recollect that at that time additional guidelines were delivered, based on that particular experience. Those guidelines, I understand, went towards creating exclusive arrangements to prevent people getting at the front doors of parliament. I would ask you to review those guidelines to see whether, in your judgment, in circumstances where a very large demonstration was likely to occur, all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had been done to prevent people getting into a position where they could run at that front door.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask you to review those guidelines. If those guidelines are inadequate, then I would ask you to seek changes to them on the basis of consultation with others in the parliament&mdash;and, of course, the President&mdash;to ensure that this situation could not occur again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also ask you to review the security arrangements associated with parliament to see whether or not there is an adequate security staff in the parliament. We have to understand that, and we ought to have understood it for many years now because our experience has been such that these things do occur basically once every two or three years, and demonstrations out the front now are frequent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe there is a requirement for a review of the security arrangements, including the strength of particular doors and approaches to the parliament. Other parliaments are, I believe, more realistic than we are as far as these matters are concerned. I refer to the security arrangements for the protection of the building, the adequacy of the forces to protect it and the guidelines that apply when any demonstrations occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the tragedy caused by the lunatics who attacked the parliament, apart from the absolutely unacceptable consequences in terms of personal damage and damage to property, is that they drew attention away from what was, around the country, a peaceful and lawful demonstration by decent citizens asserting their rights democratically to express their concerns about the direction of government policy, about broken undertakings in relation to the budget and about broken undertakings in relation to industrial relations. Those are precisely the concerns of a large number of mainstream Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were effectively two demonstrations yesterday. One occurred peacefully, which was attended by a very large number of our fellow citizens from decent ordinary mainstream Australian backgrounds&mdash;some 20,000 of them. Then there were about 500 to 1,000 louts who went off and attacked the front of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3225"> parliament. I notice that the ACTU has disassociated itself from their activity.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament of Australia, however, needs to be prepared in case that situation emerges. It is not as though, as I said, this has not happened before. The parliament has been broken into. From time to time people have effectively heckled events in this chamber from the gallery. Mr Speaker, I do believe it is essential at this point of time that this matter does not pass, that this matter is looked into closely by you and any changes that need to be made get made.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall the coalition's promise before the last election to `at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities in terms of operating grants'? The Prime Minister will be aware of the announcement by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs on 9 August 1996 to, among other things, massively cut operating grants to universities. Is the Prime Minister also aware that the Vice Chancellor of Deakin University, Professor Geoff Wilson, described those decisions affecting universities as `the worst news the university system in this country has ever had'?  Will the Prime Minister now admit that his government has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> betrayed its promise by its decision to cut university funding by some $2 billion?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I don't admit that my government has betrayed anything in relation to universities. The opposition leader has had a very bad couple of days. He has had a very, very bad presentation and, much to his disappointment, he's going to have a very bad budget tonight because the budget tonight will deliver, in a strong but fair manner, on our overriding commitments to the Australian people. It will deliver on our promise to get the economy right. It will deliver on our promise to mainstream Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say how absolutely fascinating it is that the Leader of the Opposition has grabbed hold of this word `mainstream'. They used to talk about the middle ground. It seems as though his market researchers have said, `You better start saying mainstream a bit more often, Kim.' He peppered his little indulgence speech with a reference to mainstream Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to the university package, I think the balance struck between increases in higher education charges and changes to the operating grants were very much fairer and more balanced than many people in the university sector had expected, and many people in the university sector, if they are publicly candid as they have been privately candid, will acknowledge that overall it is an extremely fair and balanced package and it ought to get the support of the Australian  people.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lindsay&mdash;and long may you continue to represent the electorate of Lindsay&mdash;can inform her constituents that tonight's budget will go very much to the needs and concerns of the mainstream families of western Sydney because tonight's budget will deliver in full on the $4 billion family tax package over a period of four years. It will deliver on the private health insurance commitment. It will deliver far more effective and targeted programs to tackle the problem of youth unemployment. Most importantly, through the fiscal restoration that the budget will achieve, it will lay the foundation in the medium term for further reductions in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You ought to say to the people of Lindsay that since the coalition government has been in office average housing loan interest rates have declined by $80 a month. The opposition may laugh, but the fact is that since we have been in power they have declined by $80 a month. If you want to add up the benefits of the decline in housing interest rates, the benefits of the family tax package and the benefits of the health insurance rebate, you will find that there are enormous family benefits for the people of Lindsay.

As I watched television last night I was struck by the comments of a number of people who were at the rally, expressing their views about the workplace relations bill. What struck me were some of the comments that related to some of the details of the bill. The reason I respond in this way to the honourable member is that, whilst what we saw yesterday was an ACTU sponsored rally that got out of control, what has not been out of control is the way in which the ACTU has run a systematic campaign of misinformation and propaganda about our legislation. For example, I heard a person on television last night say that we would force workers onto individual contracts.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And he has just repeated the line; he has just endorsed that. The fact of the matter is that the government's legislation is not anti&hyphen;worker and it is not anti&hyphen;union. As much as they may scoff, if you look at the provisions of our legislation, we support the right of people to be in a union and to be active in their union. Furthermore, we have lifted the penalties on those employers who wish to deny the right of employees to be in a union. Our point of disagreement with the ACTU is not whether people should have the right to be in a union but whether you should have the right not to be in a union. We, of course, back that 100 per cent by what we are doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As evidence of this campaign of misinformation which has been run by the ACTU and its affiliated unions and labour councils, I have here a document with a misnomer&mdash;`Fact Sheet One'&mdash;put out by the Victorian Trades Hall Council. This, unfortunately, is typical of the propaganda that you are putting out and which you as a political party have been endorsing in the last few days. For example, this one is telling workers in capital letters `You lose' and that taken away will be your `rates of pay'. That is a blatant and absolute lie. It is an absolute lie and our legislation is proof of that. This is extreme stuff, typical again, as I say, of what these people are putting out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, it says, `You lose basic human rights.' That is a basic lie. That is an absolute lie. The fact is that we have legislated to protect people's basic human rights and their entitlements. It goes on to say, `You're no longer safe at work.' That is an outrageous and irresponsible statement to make. In fact, under the heading `Occupational health and safety'&mdash;occupation health and safety is basically a state matter anyway&mdash;in terms of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our federal law, we again support the importance of having workplaces which are safe and where the entitlements and rights of employees are protected by law; and we do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one other example, this document says, `You just lost control of your savings, unless you can bargain with the boss.' Again, just another lie&mdash;another blatant lie&mdash;which you people have been propagating in the lead&hyphen;up to this rally. The fact is that, in respect of superannuation, people's basic entitlements are protected by federal law, and that will continue to be case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By all means, there is a genuine debate about the government's workplace relations bill&mdash;of course there is&mdash;and we have been prepared&mdash;in fact, we have bent over backwards&mdash;to speak with the trade union leadership, with the rank and file, with the employers and with any members of the community who wanted to express a point of view. But, ultimately, we have a particular and higher duty, and that is an obligation to fulfil the promises that we made at the last election. In the workplace relations bill, we have before the parliament a legislative proposal which encapsulates the very promises we made to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, whilst the details of yesterday will be the subject of a lot of discussion, the reality is that, in the lead&hyphen;up to yesterday's rally, the Labor Party and the ACTU have been running a systematic campaign of propaganda and misinformation about what we are doing. If we are to have a sensible debate in this country, there is plenty enough to argue about without you fabricating the basic elements of what we are proposing.</PARA>

It follows the last answer given by the Minister for Industrial Relations. Given that yesterday's rally arose from concern by working Australians about cuts to their wages, do you recall telling them in this place on 18 June that under your wage plan `Employers will pay the same amount for apprentices and trainees as they are paying at the moment'?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me state the facts, Mr Speaker, for the member for Hotham. He is the man who reduced apprenticeships and traineeships in this community, as a proportion of the work force, to the lowest number for three decades in 1995. He is the man who put young Australians on a merry-go-round of short-term training programs which, as the Working Nation evaluation shows, brought them right back again to the back of the unemployment queues. This is the man who told us all the way through last year that he was going to put $400 million into the new work opportunities program, which was going to be the best thing ever for getting young people into jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the evaluation of new work opportunities, and that $400 million program was the most ineffective labour market program of the lot. Eight out of 10 were still unemployed at the end of their experience in your short-term training programs. Again and again, you misled people. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Today</EMPHASIS> on 8 June last year, you were quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As for the assertion that we're putting people through short-term training programs and then they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> come off the long-term unemployed list, I totally reject that.</PARA>
<PARA>What did the evaluation of Working Nation say? It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relatively low outcome levels of NWO participants, however, means that the large majority of NWO participants will return to unemployment allowances. This leaves the Job Compact open to charges of `recycling' clients from long-term to short-term unemployment, rather than substantially improving their labour market prospects.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the evaluation. Let me just give you a few simple facts which completely show your lack of grasp in this area. The first is that there is no change whatever to the wage payments for existing apprentices and trainees under the government's policy. That was what I said earlier.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. I might point out that the two gold medallists, Michael Diamond and Russell Mark, who got the gold medals, and also Deserie Huddleston, who got a bronze medal in shooting, have certainly brought attention to the great performance at Atlanta that took place in a range of sports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To answer the minister's question specifically, in the last financial period running up to the Atlanta games, the government provided $950,000 to shooting sports. This was split in several different ways. Two&hyphen;thirds of that&mdash;about $590,000&mdash;was provided under the Olympic athlete program for the preparation of Australian shooters for the Atlanta and Sydney Olympic Games. The OAP funding allows Australia's leading shooters to have the opportunity to take part in high level training and also international competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also point out that the proposal for funding for the next period will be dealt with by the Australian Sports Commission. What generally happens after each Olympic Games is that the Australian Sports Commission will review all of the performances of all the different teams and individuals, including Michael Diamond, Russell Mark and Deserie Huddleston. We will then make a judgment about which sports we believe will be in the best position to perform well in the 2000 Olympics. This is what happened after Barcelona.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The actual amount that may well be provided to shooting as we prepare for the 2000 games has not yet been determined but will be shortly. The board meets again in early September. Given the performance that they achieved in Atlanta, I would imagine that the level of support would be equivalent at least to the $950,000&hyphen;odd that was provided for the preparation up to the Atlanta games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also take the opportunity, in case there are no other questions, to make a comment about the Atlanta games. Can I point out that the first medal awards in the Olympic <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3231"> Games went to our shooters, but the total number of medals won was 41&mdash;nine gold, nine silver and 23 bronze&mdash;which saw Australia finish fifth in the overall medal tally. If we were to calculate it on a per capita basis against the United States, for example, they would have needed to win 589 medals when compared with the performance that Australia put in. They only won 101 medals. China would have had to have won some 2,263 medals. So Australia did very well indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that needs to be made is that we finished well in advance of the medal tally we achieved in the Barcelona Olympics. We also saw 14 sports achieve medal wins compared with only nine in Barcelona. The very fundamental point that members should note is that there was a 33 per cent increase in the number of athletes who made it through to the finals or semi&hyphen;finals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we prepare for the 2000 Olympics, we can go forward with some confidence. Details of the budget announcements will be made tonight, but I was certainly pleased when the team returned home to Sydney to be welcomed by the Prime Minister by his indication of ongoing strong government support for the preparation of the Olympic team for the 2000 games. I am sure, like the Prime Minister and me, all members of the government&mdash;and indeed I hope all members on the other side of the House&mdash;would want us to extend on behalf of the parliament congratulations for a job well done and for the great pride that they brought to Australia. I might also indicate that during the time that I spent in Atlanta the Australian athletes were great ambassadors for Australia.

In other words, if the new arrangement you enter into has the same mix as the existing arrangements under the award, you get the same money.</PARA></TALK.START>

With your announcement last week on road funding for the Pacific Highway, could you detail the benefits for the people of Paterson, and indeed all motorists, who travel the Pacific Highway?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. He quite rightly points out in the concluding remarks in his question that 13 years of a Labor government saw no improvement to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Pacific Highway under a Labor government initiative to upgrade that road, one of Australia's busiest and most dangerous, to a proper standard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the first few months of a coalition government being elected we have been pleased to be able to announce, in concert with the Queensland and New South Wales governments, a major upgrading of that road which will see $3.1 billion being spent over the next 10 years. Indeed, that allocation of funds will bring the Pacific Highway up to a reasonable standard and lead to a significant reduction in the loss of lives and in injuries such as have occurred over the last 10 years. I remind the House that in the past 10 years some 600 people have lost their lives on the Pacific Highway, in many cases due to the poor standard of that road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Paterson points out, a detailed program was announced jointly by me and the New South Wales Minister for Roads last week. It includes a number of key projects, one of which is in the honourable member for Paterson's own electorate. He said to me as we campaigned prior to the last election, `If there is one thing we must do, it is to upgrade the Raymond Terrace road to bring it up to dual carriageway standard.' Because of that initiative that he brought forward and because of his persistent lobbying, I was pleased to be able to announce that the Raymond Terrace part of the Pacific Highway will be upgraded to dual carriageway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, many other members from this side of the House have been campaigning to upgrade the Pacific Highway. Most of all, I draw to the attention of members of this House the efforts of the member for Cowper, who in his 12 years here has relentlessly campaigned to upgrade the Pacific Highway. He has been joined in more recent years by the honourable member for Lyne, who has done a lot of work to ensure that this program comes to fruition, and by the recently elected honourable member for Page, who has campaigned also for a long time, both as a state member and as federal member, to upgrade the Pacific Highway.</PARA>

So we have universities growing in regional Australia, and they will continue to grow and be able to admit more students under the government's decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is correcting a significant inequity in the previous government's funding arrangements because, throughout the tenure of the previous government, there was a huge unmet demand and there was no incentive given to universities to increase the number of HECS funded places. If a university failed to meet its target quota, it was penalised. If it created additional places through efficiencies, through meeting the demands of niche markets, there was no additional reward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new decisions of this government, universities will be able to create additional HECS funded places over and above the agreed targets. If regional universities have staff, facilities and places which can be occupied, the government will provide additional HECS payments to the universities to enable funding for those places. The government has allowed for funding for those additional places in the budget.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3236">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major strategic aims of the government's higher education statement was to give the universities the flexibility to plan for the future, which they did not have under the previous government. Amongst the advantages of this flexibility will be the fact that they will not only be able to offer additional HECS places but also, when they have filled their HECS quota, be able to offer additional fee&hyphen;paying places to Australian students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That government had a concept of equity under which it was fair that Australian students should not have equal rights with overseas students to access Australian universities. This government will provide Australian students with that right. The consequence of that&mdash;this is something that the other side should listen to very carefully, and I want them all to hear this&mdash;is that, if universities offer just one per cent of their undergraduate load at the medium HECS rate as a fee, they will gain some additional $17 million in income next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of that, if they were to offer places next year at the rate being offered to overseas students at the average rate of about $11,000, Australian universities would gain an additional income of over $40 million next year with one per cent of fee paying students. They are allowed up to 25 per cent of fee&hyphen;paying students once they have filled their Commonwealth funded quota.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on Tuesday, 23 July 1996, of the Honourable Frederick (Fred) Meares Osborne, CMG, DSC and Bar, VRD, Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Evans, New South Wales, from 1949 to 1961; Minister for Customs and Excise in 1956; Minister for Air from 1956 to 1960; and Minister for Repatriation from 1960 to 1961; places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service; and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>Fred Osborne was elected to the federal parliament in 1949. He served as a minister for 12 years in the Menzies government and lost his seat in the very significant swing against the Menzies government in the election of 1961.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After leaving parliament, Fred Osborne resumed his career as a lawyer in Sydney. He became a partner in the firm, first of all, of Ebsworth and Ebsworth; in fact he had remained a dormant partner in that firm during the time he was in federal parliament. He subsequently joined the firm of Dudley, Westgarth and Co. He went on to build a very impressive commercial career. He became a director and/or chairman of a large number of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3239"> public companies and, in every way after his parliamentary career, became a very reputable and respected member of the business community in Sydney and, in a broader sense, throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also continued his commitment to the Liberal Party of Australia after losing his seat. It was in the context of Fred Osborne's involvement in the Liberal Party organisation in New South Wales that I got to know him very well. Until the early 1960s Fred Osborne was just a name to me, but when I joined the New South Wales executive of the Liberal Party in 1963 he was the Treasurer of the New South Wales division. He went on in 1967 to succeed Jock Pagan as the President of the New South Wales Liberal Party, a position he held until 1970.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fred Osborne's best known contribution to politics was the time that he served in the federal parliament and served as a minister between 1949 and 1961. However, a little known but nonetheless very significant contribution that Fred Osborne played in reshaping the non-Labor parties, and in particular the attitude of the Liberal Party, to an important social and political issue of the 1960s was the role he played in the internal debate within the Liberal Party on the very sensitive issue of state aid for independent schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable members will know, in the early 1960s the Labor Party was almost overwhelmingly opposed to state aid for private schools, particularly the dominant forces in the Labor Party at that time, despite the attempts of Gough Whitlam on various occasions to do something about it. It really was not until the 1972 election that the Labor Party finally embraced aid to independent schools. The Menzies government, as you will recall, in 1963 offered direct government assistance to the construction of science blocks in schools irrespective of whether they were government or independent schools. In the 1965 state election, the pro state aid policy of Robert Askin played a significant part in the defeat of the Labor government that had been in charge of affairs in New South Wales from 1941 when Sir William McKell was elected Premier under the defeat of the Renshaw government in 1965.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fred Osborne, from my own personal knowledge, played a decisive role in bringing about a change of attitude within the Liberal Party towards that aid and, in the process, brought about over time a very significant change in the composition of the Liberal Party. It was in those days an overwhelmingly protestant party, and because of the way in which the debate changed in the 1960s the character and composition and the breadth and the diversity of the Liberal Party changed very significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fred Osborne played an enduring role in that internal debate. He made a very courageous contribution at a time when something we now take for granted and regard almost as a relic of our immediate postwar history sparked a very significant difference of view. It did in the Labor Party and it certainly did in the Liberal Party. It is to the credit of people like Fred Osborne and John Carrick from New South Wales in particular that the Liberal Party managed to embrace the change and to solve the problem a little earlier than our political opponents. I have no doubt that, if you review the politics of the 1960s, the earlier and astute embrace of those changes by Menzies and others in the early 1960s was a very important political event which played a very important role in shaping what happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fred Osborne was a courteous man. He served the Crown, his country and the cause of liberty with great courage and distinction in World War II. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1940 for `bravery and devotion to duty' while assisting the evacuation of British and French forces from the coast of Norway. In 1945, while in command of the destroyer HMS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vanquisher</EMPHASIS>, he was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Service Cross for the sinking of a German U&hyphen;boat in the Atlantic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was respected and liked by all in the business community who knew him. He contributed much to charitable causes in the Sydney area. The political tradition of his family has been carried on. His son Michael is a very active member of the executive of the Liberal Party in New South Wales. He chaired a committee that led to a major <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3240"> change in the preselection system in New South Wales. I look around me and I see a number of my colleagues from New South Wales who remember those changes with enormous gratitude. I am sure they played no mean part in the election to parliament of Joseph Benedict Hockey, John Joseph Fahey, Anthony Abbott, Joanna Gash, Gary Nairn, and so the list goes on. His daughter Imogen has been a president and very active member of a branch at Longueville, which has been part of my electorate for most of the time that I have been in this place. So the family tradition is carried on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want, on behalf of his many friends, to record my appreciation and theirs for Fred's contribution to Australian politics and for the fine example of family life and ethical business practices which was his exemplar and to record our sadness at his loss but our thanks for a very long and distinguished life of service to his country in both war and peace.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to associate the opposition with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). As the Prime Minister has said, the Hon. Fred Osborne MP had a distinguished parliamentary career representing the New South Wales seat of Evans from 1949 until he lost the seat in the 1961 election&mdash;an election in which, I recall, the distinguished former member Sir James Killen benefited from the preferences of the Communist Party, much to the relief of the then Prime Minister, Mr Menzies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Osborne held a number of portfolios as a minister in the Menzies government, including Customs and Excise, Air and Navy. Clearly he was well suited to positions in portfolios related to the defence portfolio, given his distinguished service with the Royal Australian Navy and as an officer seconded to the Royal Navy during the Second World War. In fact, he served on three royal naval vessels&mdash;HMS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gentian</EMPHASIS>, HMS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Peacock</EMPHASIS> and HMS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vanquisher</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that he said that, under air and U&hyphen;boat attack, he escorted convoys in the battle of the Atlantic and that he crossed the Atlantic on some 22 occasions without ever landing in either Canada or the United States. That he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> survived convoy roles in that battle was an amazing feat, given the horrendous losses of shipping to U&hyphen;boat attack in particular. He was awarded, as the Prime Minister said, two Distinguished Service Crosses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note from his first speech in parliament on 28 February 1950 that he had very strong views on the need to ensure the wellbeing of migrants, of whom he said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I would like to join in this condolence motion and express my deep regret at the death of Fred Osborne. Fred Osborne was a very distinguished Australian.

His sister, Nancy, was the first person to win the Sydney University Medal for English and later became a senior officer in the Women's Royal Naval Service. His brother John became a doctor who practised in London. Fred, of course, we are commemorating today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister has noted, the spirit of service still lives in the Osborne family, most particularly in his son Michael, who is the metropolitan vice-president of the New South Wales Liberal Party. In his memoirs, Fred Osborne closed the account by saying:</PARA>

After his discharge from the RAAF he resumed  his studies and became a minister of the Presbyterian Church. He entered federal politics in 1952 when he won the New South Wales seat of Lyne. In his maiden speech to parliament Phil spoke of the economic difficulties facing Australia at that time&mdash;in particular, the need to contain inflation. It is funny how some things do not change a lot. He also reflected on the pressures borne by the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phil's long parliamentary career saw him embrace many issues of public concern. In the days before his retirement in 1980, he commented on a wide range of issues, including the Western economic system, the level of state borrowings, the role of the backbencher and the role of the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly got to know Phil well when I entered parliament in 1974. He was welcoming and friendly to new members. He was instructive to them about the practices of the House. He was one of those people from whom you could always get advice. He would give you a nice, long, interesting story as he gave you the advice, but it was nonetheless very enjoyable. He had a very resonant voice and he sometimes gave long rulings from the chair, but they were always inordinately courteous and they were usually impeccable so far as their technical accuracy was concerned. He was a very active member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. He was regarded with affection and respect by so many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the last time I saw Phil Lucock was at the Sydney Town Hall towards the end of 1994 when he attended an oration delivered by Malcolm Fraser to mark the 50th anniversary of the formation of the Liberal Party <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in 1944. It was obvious then that he had begun to enjoy rather indifferent health, but it was a great delight to see him. I know that he will be missed very greatly by people who served in the parliament with him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was, of course, all of his life, a passionate member of the old Country Party, then the National Country Party, now the National Party. I know that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and some other National Party colleagues can speak more directly than I can, but on behalf of the government parties I extend to Phil's family, and most particularly to his children, Robert, Ian, Patricia and Alison, our very deep sympathy in the loss of a very fine father and a well loved former member of this House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to pay tribute to Philip Lucock, a former distinguished member of the House of Representatives. He is a person who lives in my own memory. I remember coming into the place as only a very small boy and watching him in the chair. Of course, as he was frequently in the chair you could not miss him, even if you were of relatively junior status in the place. He was obvious and stood out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He represented the electorate of Lyne for the National Party from 1952 to 1980, a period of some 28 years. He was a Presbyterian minister who practised his religious ministry throughout his parliamentary career. Gough Whitlam sent me this note, which I thought I might read in full, related to him. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the parliament meets tomorrow you may be expected to pay a tribute to Phil Lucock, who retired from the House before the elections at which you were elected to it. Remembering the difficulty of saying something fresh on such occasions, I thought you might find it interesting that he was the first person to be elected to the House after the death of George VI and therefore  the first MHR to swear allegiance to our present (but last?) monarch. The Queen ascended the throne on 6 February 1952 and Lucock was elected at a by-election on 22 March 1952. Joe Cook, WA, had already been appointed to the Senate on 7 February and sworn in on 26 February. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3243">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a subsequent conversation with Gough&mdash;I thought that having sent me that missive I ought to pry further&mdash;he pointed out that Phil Lucock was the first member of parliament to swear allegiance to a Queen since the initial members of parliament. There were then subsequently two Georges and two Edwards. It is something of note, anyway, in the course of these remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gough also had another thing to say about Phil which was very interesting too. He said that his view of him when he was in the chair was that he was by far and a long way the most effective chairman in the processes, and the opposition tended to take his rulings on matters as rulings which had some authority. They were not infrequently at variance with the Speakers of the day. This is not a situation that applies now or that we anticipate applying now. But that was, as far as the former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was concerned, the situation that applied when he was in opposition for a substantial period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that Phil Lucock said that he had no regrets about being in parliament. In fact, he said that the parliament gave him an opportunity to serve many more people than he ever could have served in a parish. Along with my father, Mr Lucock had an abiding concern for the unemployed and believed that workers and management should seek to resolve their problems responsibly through cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note, too, that Mr Lucock was involved in an interesting ballot for the deputy speakership in 1978. Seventeen government members voted for the then opposition in support of his candidacy. Unfortunately for him, he was unsuccessful. In fact another former distinguished member Clarrie Millar won the ballot by 62 votes to 52.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He crossed the floor to vote with the opposition on one occasion, during the vote on the Primary Industry Bank Amendment Bill. That is something no members do very lightly. Apropos what the Prime Minister said a moment or two ago, he saw service in the RAAF as an aircraftsman during World War II. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are dealing here with a person who had the characteristic that a number of members have shared over the years, that of a man who was an excellent parliamentarian in all true senses of the word&mdash;a person who understood the parliamentary process, ruled on it effectively and gained the respect of all members of the House for his capacity to understand the processes that he was engaged in. On behalf of the opposition, I extend our sympathy to the Lucock family.</PARA></SPEECH>

A period of 28 years of service to parliament, to state and to the nation deserves our commendation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phil Lucock was born in 1916 in Kent in the United Kingdom. He was a minister of the Presbyterian Church. He served in the Royal Australian Air Force in Australia and overseas, most notably in Rhodesia training as part of the Empire Training School, but indifferent health and medical circumstance from the rigours of being in an aircrew were such that he was discharged later on in World War II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He joins that unusual grouping of members of this parliament who were ministers of religion over the years, including people like Gil Duthie from Tasmania for the Labor Party, who was a minister of religion of the Methodist Church. Phil Lucock was a minister of the Presbyterian Church. He was never short in coming forward in that regard and gave a very good sermon, I understand&mdash;as did people like Evan Adermann&mdash;a former member for Fairfax a few years back, who is still living, and is very well, in southern Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his maiden speech Phil Lucock did one other thing of particular note. He decided to quote in the context of what was a very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3244"> robust maiden speech, given the convention relating to maiden speeches from Sir Arthur Fadden, the then Treasurer of Australia, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem is still with us in a formidable degree. The government believes its policy is fundamentally the right one and is determined to follow through with it. We take for ourselves and offer to the community the encouragement of gains that have been made, but with that must go a realisation that a difficult road still lies ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>Amen to that in the context of all that awaits on this very important day but also amen to the contribution and work of Phil Lucock, who I, as the then state member for Sturt and state member for Murray in the New South Wales parliament throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, had the privilege of knowing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I always found Phil genial, in a sense a genial giant, and committed to his family, to the community, to the state and to the nation. He also had one other particular capacity, which I must say that I borrowed off him over the years&mdash;his ability to remember names of people whom he was meeting in a delegation or at a council meeting and so forth. He could go right around the room, having met them all, and nominate their first names in a very accurate way. It is an art form. It is one which Phil Lucock injected a lot of energy into as a matter of the regard and respect he had for fellow human beings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I extend deep sympathy to Robert, Ian, Patricia, Alison and all members of the Lucock family. It was a great privilege to know Phil Lucock. He set a high benchmark in personal standards and character and a high benchmark in terms of the parliamentary service he gave to the electorate of Lyne, in that area of the north coast of New South Wales, and to this great parliament of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add a few remarks to this condolence motion. In so doing, I want also to pay my respects and condolences to the family of the late Fred Osborne. Both Fred and Phil Lucock represented a generation who post World War II developed this country in a way that is too often forgotten. Fred served with very considerable distinction in the Royal Australian Navy and Phil, as the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has identified, as a member of the Empire flying training scheme trained in what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phil was a very significant parliamentarian. He saw the problem in the development of our society in trying to maintain a balance between the executive and the legislature. On quite a number of occasions he raised concerns about what he saw as the problems as the nature of government expanded and the responsibilities of those who are ministers gradually meant their divorce from the day-to-day concerns that affect the average member of the legislature. I think he waged a very effective campaign to ensure the recognition by those who are ministers of their membership continually of the House and their responsibilities to this place as well as to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phil Lucock was a very good Deputy Speaker for the duration of his service and there has already been sufficient said about the way in which he performed. In relation to his role as Deputy Speaker there is only one thing I would add to the comments of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) when he referred to the fact that so often it was his rulings that were preferred to those of the Speaker. There was one particular occasion, I recall, when he was apparently finally pestered to the point of feeling that the then honourable member for Bass, Gil Duthie, should be expelled from the services of the House, he named him. On that occasion Arthur Calwell, who was then Leader of the Opposition and, of course, a papal knight, rose to defend Gil Duthie. It seemed rather paradoxical that there should be a papal knight&mdash;a distinguished member of the Catholic church&mdash;rising to support a Methodist against a Presbyterian. I might add that, in those circumstances, his advocacy actually prevailed. It shows you that there can be unanimity in the ecumenical way in this place&mdash;even dispensed from the chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phil Lucock was a notable contributor to the parliament and he was a very good member for Lyne. I have a very fond regard for his memory, in part because when I first stood as a candidate I really knew no other <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3245"> members in this place other than casually. I had certainly not met the then leader of my party, Mr John McEwen, nor of course had I met Mr Robert Menzies. Phil, as the only person I really knew in the area, came to support me when I stood. I remember that we addressed a meeting in the streets of Walcha, which is a small country town in my area. Phil and I stood on the street corner trying hard to win support for my cause and the local bikies had been primed by my opposition to ride up and down just where we were standing. Phil, Presbyterian minister though he was, suggested we adjourn to the local hotel. As soon as we did so and had bought a drink for the bikies we were able to conduct our meeting in peace.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the current member for  Lyne I feel a duty to participate in this condolence motion and I certainly express my condolences and those of my family to the family of the late Phil Lucock. Phil and I both came from the same small country town of Wingham. As I grew up and conducted a business there Phil Lucock had a profound impact on the way I conducted that business, the way I entered <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> politics and, I suppose, by and large, the side of politics and the section of the conservative side of politics I entered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phil used to thoroughly enjoy political discussion at a very local level. Whether or not it was in a business or on the street, you could hear Phil discussing the politics of the day from one end of the main street of Wingham to the other. It was interesting to note the analogy that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) had passed on to him by former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam about Phil Lucock being sworn in: the first member of this place to have sworn allegiance to the Queen. Phil is well remembered around the township of Wingham for the fact that, when he was in the electorate and driving around the town or other towns, he would wave to everybody. He would not miss a soul. It would not matter who it was&mdash;as he drove past he always had this royal wave. Phil Lucock was well known for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He used to conduct a radio program on Sunday nights on 2RE: not just talking about religious matters, but talking about matters that were of great importance in the federal parliament of the day. This was back in the days when television was not quite as prevalent and when people listened to the radio a lot on Sunday nights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phil Lucock was a civic father in the Manning region. For one who was born in England, educated in New Zealand and a representative of the Australian parliament, I think he carried that off extremely well. I certainly am honoured to follow in his footsteps as the representative for the seat of Lyne, although when he was first elected in 1952 the seat of Lyne I think went almost from the Hunter River up to the Hastings River. I only have an electorate about a third of the size of that. The member for Paterson probably has the other two&hyphen;thirds in his electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phil Lucock used to travel far and wide throughout that electorate. He used to thoroughly enjoy those old&hyphen;fashioned street meetings and it would not matter if there was nobody there. In my early days in this party, as a party organisational person, at election time I would be called upon to introduce the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3246"> federal member speaking on the street corner. Phil would manage to get through probably a 30&hyphen; or 45&hyphen;minute speech on all sorts of very important federal issues of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, Phil is well remembered in our area. His funeral was held in Brisbane but there was a large and well attended memorial service last Friday in his home town of Wingham. I delivered the eulogy in the Presbyterian church where Phil used to minister. My opening comment was that Phil's 28 years of service to the people of Australia in the House of Representatives were but a small part of the broader service that he gave to Australia in the Air Force, as a Presbyterian minister and as a very dedicated member of Rotary. Right up until his last days he was a dedicated member of Rotary, serving his community and serving his country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that it is very important that we do honour all that Phil Lucock achieved. He always used to highlight his background. He loved to tell people, `I was born in England, educated in New Zealand and you have got me representing you in the federal parliament of Australia.' I, along with previous speakers, pass on my family's condolences to Robert, Ian, Patricia and Alison.</PARA>

I intended and wanted to represent you at the funeral of Phil Lucock but, regrettably, my aircraft was two hours late and I was not able to get there. We were well represented by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, like other speakers, offer my condolences to Phil's family: Robert, Ian, Patricia, Alison and their children, and other family members. Phil was one of those wonderful, warm <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> human beings. I did not serve in the parliament with him, but I got to know him very well over those years. I certainly will not take the time of the House to speak at great length, but he was a warm human being. He was very witty; capricious. He had a wry smile and a glint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I well remember one occasion after he had retired from the parliament and he went back into the church. I do not think anybody else has mentioned that he then became Moderator of the Presbyterian Church. He did that job particularly well indeed. I can recall one instance in Bowraville, which is a verandah&hyphen;post town in the Nambucca Valley in my electorate. We had a special day for the historical museum, and they had moved a small church from somewhere out in the valley. Phil was conducting the service. My wife and I were there, and at one stage in the sermon Phil broke off to say, `And, Gary Nehl, you can't interject!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very much aware of the wonderful job that he did as the Deputy Speaker of this House. But, Mr Speaker, I hasten to assure you that I do not aspire to emulate what has been referred to today; in other words, that his rulings were regarded as being better than the Speaker's at that time. I certainly do aspire to emulate his skill and the way he conducted himself in the Speaker's chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude, though, by saying that my friend and colleague the present member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) alluded to Phil's capacity for waving to everybody as he went around the electorate. As you all know and have probably all practised, as you are driving around you have your hands on the steering wheel and you raise a little finger here and a little finger there to greet people. Phil had the reputation of having waved to every cow and every tree in the electorate. That was merely a description of how well he served that electorate of Lyne. He was assiduous in doing that. He is a loss to Australia. He was a great Australian.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join in this motion of condolence to the late Phil Lucock. When I came here as a new member I was thrown in at the deep end. There were no briefings and those kinds of extravagances for new members, but I always found him a very courteous man, a man who was of great assistance to me. I respected him for that, and I very much appreciated the support and advice that I gained from him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He came from the school of the old Country Party. When I think of him&mdash;and I listened to some of the earlier comments&mdash;I think also of his successor, Bruce Cowan.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On budget day 1996 Australia is a long way indeed from being relaxed and comfortable. Australia feels distinctly uncomfortable and distinctly insecure. Australians feel misled and betrayed by this Howard-Fischer government. One thing stands alone as to why they have that particular feeling&mdash;that is, Australia has a Prime Minister who could not lie straight in bed. Australia has a Prime Minister who <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conned his way into power. He conned the Australian people into believing that the most conservative politician in Australia's history&mdash;his own words&mdash;had become a born&hyphen;again sensitive new age guy. He had become the sort of political leader where butter would not melt in his mouth. He had become the sort of political leader who helped little old ladies across the road.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the betrayal, throughout the insecurity and throughout the misleading of the Australian people, one broken promise among the scores of broken promises stands out. Among all the people who are feeling betrayed on this budget day 1996, one group stands out. I am talking about higher education in Australia and the students, the parents and the citizens who have as their great Australian dream fair and equal access to a university education. For all the broken promises and for all the betrayal, that is so significant on this budget day 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> For all those Australians who believed that this government would keep its promises, you have let them down. For all those Australians who believed the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he put his hand on his heart throughout the election campaign and said that he was a man of his word, they have been betrayed. For all those Australians who believed the Prime Minister when he said that he would not touch Medicare, and they voted for him on that basis, they have been betrayed. For all those Australians who believed the Treasurer (Mr Costello) when he said that he would not raise taxes, and they voted on that basis, they have been betrayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all those Australians who believed that a single public servant would not be sacked, they have been betrayed. For all those Australians in the work force who believed the promise that no worker would be worse off, they have been betrayed by this Howard government. For all those people in the child-care sector who believed the promises about family day care and the promises about benefits, they have been betrayed on this budget day 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all those people in the community who believed that state grants would not be reduced, that ABC funding would not be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3249"> touched, that labour market and employment programs would not be touched, that immigration would not be reduced, that the research and development tax concessions would remain, that the export market development grants scheme would be boosted instead of abolished, for all those people in regional Australia who believed that regional development programs would not be touched and for all those people in the social services sector who believed that the welfare budget would not be cut, all those Australians have been shamefully betrayed by this Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one thing that hurts above all that&mdash;one broken promise that cuts to the heart of working families in Australia. That is the promise that the Prime Minister made before the election that he would not touch higher education. This is the same John Howard who will talk day and night about families. The truth is that he really does not understand working families and their aspirations. There is one thing that matters to them above all else. That is the idea that their kids can have fair and equal access to a university education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that, when the Prime Minister talks about families and one Australia, he is really talking about one Wollstonecraft or one Kirribilli and the traditional white picket fence family which has the money in their household income to access higher education. That is his vision of families in Australia&mdash;one Wollstonecraft; one Kirribilli. The reality across Australia is very, very different indeed, because above all else those Australian families believe in fair and equal access for their children to a university education. It is interesting that all this rhetoric about families all comes down to the fact that the Liberal Party only believes in two types of families&mdash;the traditional family and the royal family. Even these days among the royals if you are a divorcee, you are apparently off the Prime Minister's dance card.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These family values are becoming narrower and narrower all the time and for working families in Australia&mdash;that is, the lower to middle income families&mdash;this higher education budget is an atrocity. It is a betrayal of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trust and a betrayal of the confidence that they gave this government on 2 March. It is an absolute disgrace which deserves the condemnation of this House as it has been condemned across the university sector in Australia and throughout the Australian community. Those people in the community had the great Australian dream of fair and equal access to university education for their children. It is the great equaliser in our society, that people from a working&hyphen;class background can get a university education. Those dreams and beliefs have been dashed on budget day&mdash;the budget of betrayal in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on the Labor side of the House know these things because we have been to graduation ceremonies in working&hyphen;class electorates. We have seen the tears in the eyes of the parents who watch their children&mdash;the first in their family; the first generation&mdash;take out a university degree. They did not have to buy it because they were rich; they did not have to purchase that degree because they were wealthy. That degree&mdash;the first in their family&mdash;was delivered by the policies of Labor governments. I know these things because I am one of the beneficiaries. If Gough Whitlam had not abolished tertiary fees in 1973 I would not have gone to university at the end of 1978. I see it again in my electorate. In the 1970s in western Sydney you had to travel to Sydney university because the Fraser government would not build a university in our working class region. Now, as a product of the reforms and higher education policy of Labor governments from 1983 to 1996, most of the students participating in tertiary education in my electorate go to the University of Western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) might respond in debate by saying, `Wasn't it the Labor party that introduced the HECS?' That is true, but we did it for a very sound reason, and that was that every single cent raised out of the HECS would go back into the university sector. They were the dollars that built the University of Western Sydney and gave working&hyphen;class kids their chance to get a university education. That was the funding mechanism that almost doubled the number of university places in Australia, from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3250"> 350,000 in 1983 to 630,000 in 1996. This is the government and the minister that will take out a large slab of that funding expansion. Earlier today he was here in question time saying, `These universities should be quite thankful that they will have a dollar term increase in their budget. All we have done is take away their growth funding.' Of course, on the forward estimates every single cent that was going to universities in Queensland, Western Australia and western Sydney was growth funding to keep up with the population growth and the per capita arrangements that the Labor Party set in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Goldstein is saying, `You can have a small dollar increase in your university funding, but we will slash away the growth funding and the per capita funding.' It is like saying to those universities and working&hyphen;class kids and families, `You should be thankful that I stole your car but I did not steal your TV.' It is like the member for Goldstein saying, `You should be thankful we are sucking the blood dry out of the university sector, but we are not driving a stake through your heart.' The truth is that the government cannot have it both ways. It must understand that it is damaging the growth and expansion of the university sector in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that is raising extra revenue out of fees and a separate system of university funding based not on merit but on wealth. If you have the wealth and the disposable family income to buy a university place, you can have it based on wealth alone. In all those contests for university spots below the HSC cut&hyphen;off point, if you have the money in your pocket, if you are from Kirribilli or Wollstonecraft or if you have a wealthy family background, you can buy a university place. They are also placing an active disincentive on working&hyphen;class kids to make the choice for their university future by lowering the HECS threshold from $28,000 to $20,000. That is a difficult choice for those students because they have the problem of forgoing income by undertaking a university education. When you tip the balance, you tip the balance against their active decision and opportunity to undertake a university education.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the irony of this is that every single cent that this government is raising on the revenue side in higher education is being taken away from the universities. The government is taking the money out of the higher education sector to put it into its flawed budget strategy. It has both hands around the throats of Australian universities and working class students. It has one hand collecting more HECS and collecting it earlier and another hand taking away the grants from those universities. It is very interesting indeed to note the response of the minister, Senator Vanstone. She described these particular cuts, the $623 million over four years, as `just a nick'.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, `just a nick'. The truth is that what she was effectively saying to working class families was `nick off'. That is what she was really saying to working class families, because this government is in the business of establishing a higher education sector not on the basis of merit, need, regional location or equity, but on the basis of wealth and privilege. She is saying `nick' all right; `nick off' to working class kids and their families. She is placing an active disincentive in the way of those students who are worried about the possibility of paying HECS back on a threshold of $20,000 per annum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She is also in the business of demanding higher repayments to be a professional&mdash;that is, the best jobs in society go to those who can afford in advance that particular HECS payment. As many academics and university administrators have acknowledged, that is creating a two&hyphen;tier education system in Australia; one for the rich and one for the poor. Not only that, but in the budget tonight we will see it in health; one health system for the rich and one for the poor. These are the standards of this government with its budget of betrayal. Overall, the greatest betrayal is in higher education. There are many families in the suburbs and regional towns of Australia who are feeling worried about this budget. They are feeling worried about the cutbacks and the loss of the active role of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was at a gathering in my electorate recently with a group who had come together to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3251"> protest about cuts to the family day care arrangements. There was one lady who stood up who I thought typified the impact of the Howard government on what the Prime Minister calls the mainstream. She was a genuine battler. She introduced herself to this protest meeting by saying, `I am not all that much of a public speaker and I am quite nervous about it.' She did not have to be a public speaker because she spoke from the heart.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She was a battler. Maybe she had supported John Howard at the last election. You just listen to what she had to say about it. She said, `How could it get any worse under this government? I am a public servant. They are about to take away my job. The opportunity I have to participate in the work force is a product of family day care, which is about to lose its operational subsidy.' Not only that but she lives at Holsworthy and they are about to put jumbo jets over her house. She said, `How can it get any worse?' It can get even worse. The sad reality for that battling family is that when those kids grow up they have to face the prospect of barriers being placed in their way towards a higher education. They have to face the prospect of a two&hyphen;tier higher education system in Australia, of 30,000 growth places being lost out of the sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When their children grow up, they face the prospect of not being able to buy a place because they have not got the wealth, of not being able to get a place because the University of Western Sydney and the universities in Queensland and Western Australia are losing their growth funding, and of being scared away from the higher education sector by these radical and unworthy changes to the HECS scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government of many contradictions. John Howard's slogan on the economy is `sack to employ'. That is the economic strategy he has in place. Sacking public servants is somehow going to have a positive impact on the unemployment rate&mdash;a stark contradiction. Another contradiction is that they never believe in better government, they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believe only in less government&mdash;not understanding the active, positive things that government can do to make our society better and more equal. They have a stunning contradiction these days on regional development: the National Party are saying that they have no constitutional or funding role in regional development. What are they doing here? This is a clearance sale on National Party ideology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all those contradictions, one stands out: the idea that Australia can become a smarter country by making it harder for people to get into university. That is what they are about. It is a stunning contradiction to say, `You can make Australia smarter by making it harder for working people, for low income earners, to get into university.' On 20 August 1996, in this budget of betrayal, we are seeing the birth of the not&hyphen;so&hyphen;clever country; the birth of a two&hyphen;tier higher education system. The government stands condemned for its scores of broken promises dashing the hopes of battlers and working class families.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There will be an increase across the board in university places, there <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3252"> will be an improvement overall in the funding of universities and there will be an enormous improvement in the equity of higher education policy. The government responsible for squeezing the higher education system, for shutting tens of thousands of qualified students out of universities, for discriminating against Australian students and for keeping the number of university places down was none other than the previous Labor Party government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very happy to detail to this House the nature of the inequities that existed in the previous policy, which this government has now redressed. The concept of equity is one which was highly ideological. It did not reflect the views of mainstream Australia. It disadvantaged young working&hyphen;class people who could not get into the Commonwealth funded places under the previous government. The sort of people the member for Werriwa is referring to generally came from schools in disadvantaged areas. They were the ones who tended to have the lowest entry scores and were disproportionately represented amongst the tens of thousands who made up that statistic of unmet demand, against whom the doors of the universities were locked by the ideology of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy involved in the remarks of the member for Werriwa almost beggars belief. His party, after all, introduced the HECS scheme on existing students and went to election after election promising not to increase HECS and increased it relentlessly year after year. In 1989, the thresholds were one, two and three per cent. In 1990, the Labor Party government increased the thresholds for repayment to two, three and four per cent. In 1993, they increased the thresholds to three, four and five per cent. In 1995, they added four new levels of repayment on top of the existing ones&mdash;3.5, 4.5, 5.5 and six per cent&mdash;with the support of their colleagues in the National Union of Students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people are averse to these sorts of charges and fees, if the member for Werriwa's battlers are averse, they would be averse to these sorts of changes. In addition to that, you forbade the universities to provide Australian students with the same opportunities to invest <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in their future which you were very willing to provide to overseas students. Australian students were denied the rights of entry to universities that overseas students were granted. And why? Purely for ideological reasons. When the universities wanted to increase places above their target quotas, when they wanted to offer more places, what did the previous government say to them? `No additional funding for those places. You'll be penalised if you offer additional places.' What was the unmet demand? How many students were shut out? Last year, the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee estimates that between 16,000 and 24,000 qualified students were locked out. Students probably disproportionately from the less advantaged areas of this society were simply locked out of the universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has reviewed this whole issue of equity of access to universities and has taken and announced a number of decisions which will greatly broaden access and the resourcing of Australia's universities. We fully expect that the consequence of these decisions will be that there will be more students in Australia's universities than there are today, that those universities will be better funded, that the research conditions for staff will be greatly improved, that the universities will have the freedom to address the needs of the students in a way that they did not have under the rigid, centralised, bureaucratic profiles processes that the previous government put in place. The decisions that have been announced are ones that this government is proud to stand by and which should have been introduced a long time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the right of Australian students to access universities, we are giving them that right. We are giving them the same right that the previous government was prepared to give overseas students, to invest in their own future and to obtain places in Australian universities. That is fair and equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are adjusting the HECS contributions, not for existing students but for new students, so that they more realistically take into account the costs and the income prospects of students in different courses. The previous <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3253"> government thought it was fair that a student wanting to go into teaching should pay 25 per cent of the cost of their course, whereas a medical student, with a much better prospect of higher income in the future and a much more costly course for the taxpayer to provide, contributed only 13 per cent. What concept of equity was that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that most Australians who reflect on the changes we are making to the structure of HECS to take into account the costs and the income prospects of students will realise the changes we have made are fair and equitable. They are fair and equitable for, and advantageous to, students who, for one reason or another, perhaps unwisely, are avoiding the higher cost courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things we must recognise is that the previous government, in introducing HECS, did introduce a mechanism which enables everyone who wants to access universities the chance to do so in a way which ought not to deter them, regardless of their present income and present financial situation, because they pay back nothing until they are in a financial position to make that repayment. We maintain that system. We supported it at the time, it had bipartisan support, and we continue to support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, we are going a very important step beyond what the previous government was prepared to do. We are getting rid of the ideological restriction imposed on the right of universities to create additional places. Under the policies we have announced, a university which has met its full Commonwealth funded quota of HECS supported places can create additional HECS supported places. We will pay the universities the HECS attributable to those places. That means universities which have unused resources, which have staff available to teach courses, can expand the number of places available and funded through the HECS scheme. The government has fully factored in the cost of that in its calculations for the funding of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> From 1998, universities will be able to offer additional fee paying places to Australian students, who will be allowed for the first time to invest in their higher education. Those additional places will be particularly advanta geous to women, who very often want to re&hyphen;enter the higher education stream to provide themselves with qualifications. The opportunities will be there, if they cannot get into the HECS funded places, to access those additional places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition affects some ideological objection to this. The former Labor government constantly opposed this on ideological grounds. It supported fees at the school level, it supported overseas students being allowed to access these places, but it does not like the thought of Australian students being able to access these places. The fact is that as a result of these decisions the resourcing of the university system will improve significantly over the coming years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the decisions announced by Senator Vanstone on behalf of the government, the operational and research funding&mdash;the total Commonwealth provided funding for Australia's universities&mdash;will increase next year by some $51 million. This gives the lie to the claims made by the opposition that the government is going around slashing funding to universities. The government's efficiency savings are being imposed across the public sector. The opposition, when in government, put in place the Hoare management review of universities, indicating that it had concerns over the efficiency of university management, and now it complains when the government imposes an efficiency dividend on universities&mdash;an efficiency dividend which will not prevent the resourcing of universities improving. In addition to the operational funding that the Commonwealth will provide&mdash;when you take research funding into account, the total Commonwealth contribution to universities will fall in the following year, in 1998, by about $8 million&mdash;they will have access to these additional HECS funded places and the fee paying places that they will be able to create.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the decisions announced by the government, from 1998&mdash;I may have given the impression in an answer earlier that access to those additional fee paying places will be from next year; they will not be from next year, they will be from 1998&mdash;there will be a fall in the total Commonwealth contribution. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3254"> Because we are properly rebalancing the public and the private contributions to universities there is a very strong private benefit, and we are recognising that. That has been embodied in our decisions, and that is fair. It is fair that the private benefit is recognised by shifting the balance between the Commonwealth supported effort in the universities and the privately supported effort. The benefit of that change will flow to Australian families and, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, that will be very evident in the budget tonight. Not only will the universities have for the first time the strategic flexibility that the former government was never prepared to give them; they will also be able to provide additional places over and above those which are currently in the system, and they will have more resources with which to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the decisions of the previous government, only about 55 per cent of total university income in Australia is now provided by the Commonwealth. We are taking decisions which will allow the universities that further flexibility so that they can design their courses and their places to meet the demand which exists out there in the community. These decisions have been taken to reflect a full commitment by the government to a world&hyphen;class university system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The notion that university resources will be slashed is nonsense and the notion that places will be reduced is nonsense. It is time for the opposition to wake up to the fact that it is trying to mislead people. It is trying to distort the situation and create anxiety where there is absolutely no ground for it to exist. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's package for higher education, as this matter of public importance points out, is a crass betrayal of young Australians' aspirations for fair access and participation in higher education. It is a package that involves not only betrayal but deception as well. It is a massive breach of promise to the Australian electorate. It is a package that forgoes equity and access. It rejects inclusiveness and promotes exclusivity. And it is a package that is funded on hypocritical principles. Without doubt, the proposals will do significant harm to Australia's system of higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, Australia's higher education system was internationally regarded as `one of the most accessible systems in the world'. The shadow minister has pointed out the growth in enrolments from around 350,000 in 1983 to 630,000 this year. That is some achievement. Over the four forward estimates years for the current budget to the year 2000, this government intends to achieve net savings of $1.8 billion through a combination of funding cuts and dramatically increased HECS charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, even that $1.8 billion understates the real position as universities will have to absorb the cost of salary increases to the tune of $200 million to $300 million&mdash;we are over $2 billion. The government's higher education package, as I said, is a massive breach of promise on the part of the coalition to the Australian electorate. This is the very same coalition which undertook before the election to `at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants'. This is when the vice-chancellors said, `This is a fair thing.' Even many of the students said, `This is a fair thing.' But the coalition did more than just massively breach of promise: it deceived students, it deceived parents and it abrogated their commitment to HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House&mdash;some of us have been here for a while&mdash;always knew that the coalition's commitment to education <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3255"> would be broken. We have watched their changing frontbench and their attitude and behaviour to education for many years: from a Prime Minister who refused an education portfolio to a frontbench that, almost without exception, responded to any debate on education with derisive yawns and guffaws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many in the Australian electorate believed their promises at the last election. They will know better next time. This is not a government that will acknowledge the needs of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, this is not a government that believes in fairness and equity, and this is not a government that gives Australians in regional Australia a fair go. There is not one member from the National Party in the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increased HECS charges will mean that those from low income backgrounds will need to contemplate a greatly increased level of financial risk before they consider embarking on a university course. Cutting public funding while allowing universities to charge full fees to some students will mean a progressive substitution of HECS paying students with full fee paying students in the more sought after courses which lead to lucrative careers. That will mean opportunities for the rich and the thick. Given that there are currently 630,000 students in Australia, the so-called equity programs announced by the government are nothing short of farcical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) is in the chamber, but I would like to see the other South Australian members here&mdash;including the members for Makin (Mrs Draper), Kingston (Ms Jeanes), Mayo (Mr Downer), Barker (Mr McLachlan), Boothby (Dr Southcott) and Wakefield (Mr Andrew). With the six South Australian senators and the other South Australian members&mdash;the whole 16 of them&mdash;they lay down and rolled over for this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party are going to give 1,000 merit based scholarships, but they will do nothing to counter the negative impact of the changes for the disadvantaged. In South Australia&mdash;and I mention this for the benefit of the member for Sturt&mdash;we are going to get 100 scholarships and, in return, we are going to lose 1,504 places. That is a good deal for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> South Australia! The 16 Liberals&mdash;including Senator Vanstone&mdash;got up and fought for South Australia! They did South Australia in the eye.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about regional institutions? Many of them are new and stand to suffer greatly as funds are cut and fee paying students migrate to more established and prestigious institutions. A number of regional universities, because they are new, are already operating on very tight budgets. They lack the depth of resources of the more established institutions and do not have the wherewithal to survive these cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional young Australians have been deceived by this government. The coalition argument that regional institutions are protected is very, very different to the reality. No matter how you do the numbers and no matter what double speak you use, what we are talking about is reduction and reduced opportunities for young Australians in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's funding package for higher education is nothing but blatant hypocrisy. The universities are being told to take increased student numbers, but they are getting less funding. For example, the government fails to take into account the decision to abolish funding for a range of important programs grouped together as discretionary funds. This amounts to $214 million over the forward estimates years. To be fair, the government actually announced that before the election. But the government also fails to take into account that over 90 per cent of Commonwealth funding for universities is provided in the form of operating grants. These will be cut by $623.6 million compared with the levels of the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3256"> The reality is that funding per student must decline. Staff/student ratios will increase, and educational quality must suffer a consequent loss. The government also fails to provide supplementation for staff salary raises. The effect of this will be to put universities under significant financial stress&mdash;to the tune of $200 million to $300 million annually. What will be the result of this, Minister Kemp? We will have our most schooled people in univer sities getting on the first Qantas flight overseas. We will have the brain drain. They will react, and they will simply go overseas. It will mean larger classes, reduced quality of education and diminished course offerings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are the expert in hypocrisy and double speak. The member for Sturt is going to get up and argue that South Australia is going to benefit by losing. The government argues that the pay increases were funded by productivity agreements, but it hypocritically fails to explain how such productivity improvements might be achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the most blatant and the most ugly hypocrisy is yet to come. Having decided to make the major cuts in higher education, the coalition hypocritically makes students pay for the privilege. Yes, you are raising HECS to $3,300, $4,700 and $5,500. Students are going to pay another $313 million over four years. Then, out of the talented young Australians, you are simply going to take some of their aspirations away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does not stop there. In terms of the threshold, you are going to recover another $817.4 million at the very beginning of young people's careers. A total impost of $1.3 billion will certainly deter many prospective students from filling their aspirations in higher education. Of course, those students will come from working&hyphen;class and disadvantaged areas&mdash;our areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum up, the government's measures are a major blow to quality and equity and will have a devastating effect on the aspirations of young Australians. The government has instituted major changes; yet, extraordinarily, you have announced that you will undertake a major review. How do you like that mind&hyphen;boggling effort? You have announced major changes, and tonight you are going to announce a major review. That is competence of the highest level, I do not think.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 March the Australian people gave the tired Labor government a very simple message&mdash;`Your time is up and we won't need your services for a very long time.' After listening to the contribution to this debate from the member for Port Adelaide, Mr Sawford, it is little wonder that they gave them that message.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His speech was one of the most simplistic assessments of higher education policy in Australia. In fact, it was so bad that I thought his enemies within his own faction had written it for him to embarrass him publicly, knowing the humiliation he would suffer after delivering such a ridiculous assessment. You quoted from Orwell's books but, after listening to your speech, I wonder how they ever came to your attention. I hope that next time you make a contribution it is more erudite than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people rejected the Labor Party after 13 years of government because they were sick of recessions, wildly fluctuating interest rates and years of darkness with all too little economic sunshine. The people had quite simply had enough. They no longer believed in a government that had begun to treat unemployment as a statistical problem to be fudged, rather than a human epidemic to be cured. They no longer believed in a government that spouted access and equity and delivered neither, and nowhere was their failure more evident than in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not yet six months since the people dropped the not too subtle hint that they preferred our vision to the Labor Party's indifference. Now, however, the opposition are presuming to speak for vice-chancellors, academics, students and parents of future students by saying that we have betrayed young Australians. They are now actually seeking to wear the clothes of the advocates and protectors of students after 13 years of abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the facts. It was the Labor government which introduced HECS in the first place. It was the Labor government which ended so&hyphen;called free education by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3257"> Whitlam government. They did so for good and simple reasons: the dream had failed, the demographic profiles of the student body had not changed in 10 years and free education and living allowances had not done a thing except burden the higher education system and reduce its effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, it was the Labor government which increased HECS not once, not twice but three times in one parliament. In doing so, they clearly buried the notion that tertiary education is more a right than a privilege. Higher education is, in the main, financed by the taxpayers of this country. There is little complaint even from those who derive no direct benefit from the system because their investment produces qualified people who benefit Australia during their working years. That benefit is dependent on graduates being able to find a job. For every graduate to become productive, they must be qualified and the work force must be capable of absorbing them. On both counts, the Labor Party stand condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP's shallow commitment to academic excellence was clearly demonstrated by their introducing full fees for students choosing to do postgraduate studies. Rather than rewarding the ambitious, those who would in the long term contribute more to Australia, they penalised them. They now have the hypocrisy to lament their own actions and try to put the blame on this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, while they expanded the tertiary education sector massively, as they pointed out, they reduced per capita funding for students as though the priority were not to truly educate but to reduce the unemployment queues that they were also responsible for. What hypocrisy! The Labor Party are standing here today and trying to wear the new clothes of the advocates for students and academics when in fact on every single count they were responsible for introducing the changes that ended the system&mdash;a cacophony of praise for their own system, for the Whitlam government, which they have dismantled over their period of government. Now they seek to pretend to the students and the NUS, who seem only too ready to accept, that they were in fact their advocates for those 13 years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition believes that the term `the clever country' must mean something very real. The policies announced by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) signal a much needed changed in attitude and direction, a change that will benefit all Australians in the long run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The old adage that `we only get what we pay for' holds true in education. This government is asking students to contribute a little more towards their education, but our aim is to improve the system so the benefits will be greater. I am puzzled that the Labor Party, which claims exclusivity on social justice, fails to see the equity in asking those students taking specialised courses to pay a little more than those who are taking more general studies, especially given that the top 20 per cent of households derive more than five times the benefit from education than the bottom 20 per cent of households. I am amazed, given those statistics, that it would oppose changes to this system. If the Labor Party members were supposed to have learnt the lessons from their crushing defeat on 2 March, they very clearly have not. Their collective backs have been turned, obviously, to their base constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should the taxpayer who has not attended university, or whose children are not attending university, wholly subsidise those students who will go on to a career fast track and ultimately join the ranks of the very high income earners? Among Labor ranks, there used to be many proponents of soaking the rich&mdash;perhaps their new tack is to soak the poor. It should be noted well that the changes to HECS will not affect students already undertaking a university course. This is in sharp contrast, yet again, to those opposite whose approach was to retrospectively increase HECS on existing students no fewer than three times in the last parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some in the Labor Party have made the amazing claim that this government's initiative to allow Australians to purchase a university place will lead to thick young people from rich families receiving preference over any other. It was the previous government which introduced fees for students from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3258"> overseas countries for places over and above the government provided places. They did not, however, allow Australians the same opportunity: `No,' they said, `you're an Australian and you shouldn't have to pay but, as there is no room for you, you can't go to university.' It is pure pretzel logic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new initiative will provide Australians with increased access to university places. Paying students will be able to take their place in a degree course of their choice rather than languish in a less preferred option as long as the university has first filled its HECS places. This will free up a place for someone else who is desirous of the place that they have given up. Certainly they will have to pay their way, but their places will not come at the expense of the HECS paying students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If universities were to attract only a one per cent additional undergraduate student load in 1997 in the form of fee paying undergraduates, this alone would generate an extra $17 million of additional income for an average fee of $4,700. Imagine what the universities would be able to do with that! Of course, no-one supposes that it will be as low as one per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our academic institutions must compete with other universities around the world. Excellence is the key. It is not good enough to say we provide higher education for all. There is duplication. There is a degree of waste. There is not enough excellence. Why should an MBA from Harvard University mean more than one from an Australian university? Why should a law degree from Yale mean more than an LLB from Australia? Why, for example, with all of Australia's mining activity, can we not have the best tertiary training for that type of career? Why should Australians have to venture overseas to attain the best qualifications? As we know, some of them will never return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next three years we will be funding an additional 100 postgraduate awards at a cost of $9.3 million. We will be providing another $30 million for collaborative research grants to foster links between our universities and industry. We will provide $90 million for research and for investment in new equipment for facilities. This is no betrayal. Rather, in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> honouring our commitments, we keep the faith with the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around this time of the year, passions are aroused by the widespread rumours of cuts. The university vice&hyphen;chancellors hit the trail months ago to sell the line that this government would savage the budget for higher education. In fact, Commonwealth funding for higher education operating grants and research will increase by $50 million next year. If that is `savage', I would like to know what `catastrophic' is for universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Universities are being asked to find savings of 1c in every dollar this year. They will have the time to plan and budget so that they can find another 4c in the dollar by 1999. These are hardly draconian measures, especially at a time when many Australians are being asked to make sacrifices for the greater national good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If those whipping up the hysteria in the community about our higher education policy would study the facts, they would find some interesting initiatives. One such plan is the introduction of 4,000 HECS&hyphen;free scholarships that will aid people from rural and remote areas, indigenous students and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>As all here in this House are aware, the tragedy in Port Arthur in April prompted historic decisions in relation to firearms in this country. On l0 May and 17 July the Australasian Police Ministers Council agreed on nationwide gun control measures. I have already set out the details of these measures for the House during debate on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1996 and Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All governments in this country are agreed that possession of firearms is not a right but a conditional privilege. The new measures <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will include effective nationwide registration of all firearms, the need for applicants for firearms licences to establish a genuine reason for owning, possessing or using a firearm and uniform basic licence requirements. Personal protection will not be regarded as a genuine reason for owning, possessing or using a firearm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A significant element of the measures is the amnesty and compensation scheme for owners of self-loading rifles, self-loading shotguns and pump-action shotguns. Such guns are to be the subject of nationwide restrictions. There will be limited access to certain categories of self-loading rifles and shotguns and pump-action shotguns for primary producers and exemptions for military, police and occupational shooters licensed for a specific purpose such as extermination of feral animals. The scheme will require gun owners to hand in firearms falling within the restricted categories during the nationwide amnesty period in return for fair and proper compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth agreed to meet fully the direct cost of the compensation-for-surrender scheme, funds for which have been raised by a one-off increase in the Medicare levy for the income year 1996-97. This increase is already in effect and it remains only to permit the moneys raised to be paid to the states and territories to assist them in achieving the full implementation of the new nationwide gun control measures overwhelmingly supported by the majority of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very large total cost is involved. It is estimated that the increase in the Medicare levy will raise around $500 million. This government has agreed to provide assistance to the states on such a scale to demonstrate national leadership in dealing with the problem of gun control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill allows me to authorise payments by way of financial assistance to the states and territories for the purpose of providing compensation to firearms owners and dealers. It also allows me to authorise payments to the states and territories and by the Commonwealth for purposes directly connected to the compensation scheme and for implementation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3260"> of the new nationwide licensing and registration schemes. The bill appropriates moneys from the consolidated revenue fund for these purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Payments for reimbursement of compensation paid for surrendered firearms are limited to those surrendered during the national amnesty period of 10 May this year to 30 September next year, or such shorter period as I determine if any jurisdiction decides on a shorter amnesty. Gun dealers will also be able to claim for loss of business associated with surrender of stock and the Commonwealth will reimburse the states and territories for compensation paid in relation to such claims if the claim is lodged during the national amnesty period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Swift action is essential if we are to have really effective nationwide firearms laws. The Commonwealth has already demonstrated its commitment by acting quickly to amend the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to complement the resolutions of the Australasian Police Ministers Council and by increasing the Medicare levy. Now it is time to take the next step to support the states and territories in their endeavours to achieve effective controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simple and short though it is, this bill is of major importance in the implementation of the national firearms program. It provides support to the states and territories, will enable the compensation-for-surrender scheme to go ahead and, I hope, encourage owners of banned firearms to come forward and surrender them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, therefore, extremely important that the bill be passed through the parliament as quickly as possible. The government has acknowledged this by introducing it on the first day of sittings. We have had the support of the opposition right from the beginning for the new nationwide firearms laws and it has been invaluable in achieving community consensus. I ask the opposition to continue that support and pass this bill quickly. In this way we will help to encourage the speedy surrender of these firearms and ensure greater protection from violence for the whole Australian community. Let us all act together to make this country a safer place. I commend <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) before the parliament has two primary purposes. One of those could fairly be described as quite routine in that it closes a loophole in the Defence Force Discipline Bill, which is consequent upon some changes in legislation in the ACT. The purpose of that bill has been set out in the explanatory memorandum and in the second reading speech of the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop). Of course, the opposition is happy to support that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal purpose of the bill before the parliament, though, goes to improvements in the subsidised loans available to Defence Force personnel through amending the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act. The improvements involve an increase in the maximum loans available from $40,000 to $80,000 in the case of personnel where there is only one serving member in the family. Where there are two serving members in the family and a joint entitlement, the maximum level is increased from $80,000 to $160,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition supports the bill and particularly welcomes those initiatives to assist Defence Force personnel. Importantly, the bill also provides for a reduction in eligibility for loans from six years to five years and extends the eligibility to include reserves and emergency forces. These measures are welcomed by the opposition. Indeed, those measures were committed to by Labor prior to the last election. I am delighted that the Liberal Party, in the lead-up to the election, endorsed those commitments and extended on them. That is a matter that I will be pursuing when we get to discussion of the bill in detail because I will be giving the government the opportunity <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3261"> to actually implement the full intent of their election promises through the amendment I will be moving at that stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn my attention to the positive aspects of the bill. It is appropriate that people in the defence forces have their conditions of service checked on a regular basis to ensure that they meet the needs of the service and the changing demands the service places upon them and that they also keep pace with wider community variations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Defence personnel are our greatest defence asset. We place a lot of attention and media focus on the various pieces of hardware that go to make up the equipment Defence Force personnel use, but there can be no doubt that the great advantage Australia has in its defence is the dedication, the training, the commitment and the sheer quality of those people who wear the uniforms. That is an assessment which I am sure all members of the House who have had the pleasure of any experience of defence personnel would gladly endorse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate that we do acknowledge that defence personnel are placed under conditions that are not normally to be accepted or confronted by others in the work force. One of those is a very regular requirement to transfer location. Posting rotations of two or three years are not uncommon and requirements to shift not from one town to another but from one corner of the country to another are not uncommon. I am aware that the government is looking at the opportunity to extend the length of postings, as did the previous government. Indeed, a number of comments were made in the Glenn report about the importance of providing some stability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that people have to endure very significant transfers on a regular basis, from one corner of the nation to another, dislocates a whole range of things. It makes life difficult for those who have a spouse and for those who have children. It makes it difficult for them in relation to their children's education as they move from one system to another. It makes it difficult for their spouse to engage in paid employment. The opportunity for a spouse of a Defence Force person to maintain <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a career structure is invariably cut short every three years or so as they are moved from one part of the country to another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also makes life difficult in some of those things that many in what I might describe as normal employment would take for granted: the opportunity to acquire a house, to make it your home, to invest some of your life savings into it and to call one place your family's home. It is partly in recognition of those things that the government has, over time, provided a subsidy to assist defence personnel to acquire accommodation and to purchase their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that, over time, the level of home loan assistance has not kept pace with the rising cost of real estate. It was for that reason that the Labor Party in government committed to an increase identical to the increase that the new Liberal government has now legislated for. We are therefore very happy to support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very pleased to note that the bill picks up on an extension of eligibility to reserves. Increasingly, the part-time defence forces of Australia are going to play an important role in the defence of our nation. If Army 21 ever does get to see the light of day&mdash;as each month goes past there are more and more questions asked about that&mdash;and assuming the minister does finally get around to making a decision about Army 21 and it gets endorsed in anything like the form it was submitted in, then we will see a much greater role for reserves and a recognition that Australia's defence relies upon a total force made up not just of the dedicated full-time personnel but also of those dedicated part-time people. Typically, they add to a private job, family responsibilities and normal community activities the burden of very significant Defence Force service contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate that reserves are able to access defence home loan assistance. I applaud the initiative that allows a full-time equivalent of service for reserves to be counted as eligibility for access to the home loans assistance scheme. The requirement for reserves over time is going to increase, and I would urge the minister and the government to look more broadly at other conditions of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3262"> service that are currently applied to full-time personnel and to look at their application to part-time reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to have a total force in which reserves play an integral part&mdash;and that is certainly the way in which the forces are now structured and I believe the way in which they will be into the 21st century&mdash;then we do need to look at a continuum of not just service but of benefit to those who serve. That means addressing not just questions such as home loans but rates of pay, access to medical benefits, dental benefits, long-service leave, superannuation and a raft of other benefits that accrue to those in full-time employment in the services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a significant step, though, in recognition of the contribution that reserves make. It was a commitment of the Labor government before the election that we would legislate to do these things and we support the initiative now taken by the Liberal government to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a concern to me that in practical terms some of these measures are not in accord with other activities of the government. Much of Australia's defence forces are distributed in regional Australia. Those difficulties that I mentioned people encounter when they transfer are exacerbated when regional Australia is feeling some economic pain. The fact of life is that this government in its short time has already determined to reduce support for regional development programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made a series of reductions in government services in a number of areas. I could go through the debates about the cuts in the department for regional planning, the cuts in job creation programs and the cuts in the forward estimates for tertiary places in regional Australia. All of those things impact very much upon defence personnel who are increasingly being placed in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, when we talk about the difficulty that defence spouses are placed in when they move to new locations and have difficulty in getting jobs, those cuts which the government is making now that affect regional Australia impact doubly upon those spouses. They are doubly disadvantaged. They confront the same <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> economic difficulties as everybody else in that community but as new people into the location suffer an additional burden that places them behind the eight ball.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When their children move to a school whose funding has been restricted or seek to go to a tertiary institution in regional Australia only to find that there are fewer places next year than were provided for in the forward estimates of the last budget, they suffer along with everybody else. It is passing strange that these initiatives, which I endorse in this bill, unfortunately and regrettably are not supported by other initiatives that the government has taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn to the matter of the government's pledge before the last election. During the election campaign, the Liberal Party's policy statement was committed to those things that are contained in this bill, but of course the Liberal Party is committed to other things as well. I will quote the relevant section from the Liberal Party's own document, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will increase the maximum loan value under the ADF home loan assistance scheme from $40,000 to $80,000 and the eligibility period will be reduced to five years. This will come into effect by 1 July 1996, not 1 January 1997 as proposed by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA>After the second reading debate, I will move an amendment to give effect to that part of the promise which has either been omitted because people overlooked it or omitted because they no longer have the heart to implement the undertaking. The amendment that I will move will ensure access to these new home loan limits from 1 July, and will afford government members the opportunity to vote for their own policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign the Liberal Party sought to make quite some play out of the fact that it was offering to service personnel a better package, if you like, a better support and incomes package, than the Labor Party was offering. You cannot have it both ways.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it is not `forced to defend it', I am not sure what your letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  of 19 May was then. In your letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  of 19 May you replied to a gentleman whom I assume is in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3264"> the services because he seems very interested in the issue. You referred to Wayne Pocock's letter concerning the government's commitment to legislate to double the maximum value of the loan available to members of the ADF under the defence home owner scheme from $40,000 to $80,000. You said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would point out that we also promised to reduce the eligibility period of service from six years as proposed by the Keating regime to five years under this government.</PARA>
<PARA>You have done that&mdash;I acknowledge it. You went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We further promised to extend the entitlements to General Reservists after a qualifying period of eight years of effective service.</PARA>
<PARA>And you have done that. You then say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All these promises will be honoured.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a very selective letter you decided to send at that time. You obviously went through your own policy statements&mdash;I assume you are familiar with the detail of your own policy statements; it was only a couple of months ago that we had the election&mdash;and in May this year you had already decided that you were not going to honour that 1 July commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you wrote back in May you enunciated every one of the obligations that you had put before the election, bar one. So on 19 May you had already determined you were going to renege on that undertaking. Your comments here in the chamber today just reinforce that view that that is exactly what you were about&mdash;you intended to renege on it. I have got to say that you did not convince Mr Pocock because he wrote back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday, 28 May. I could read that letter to you, but I imagine you recall it. I am sure someone in your department clipped it for you and brought it to your attention. But he did not miss you. He understood that you were fudging, and fudging you are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will have the opportunity to demonstrate I am wrong when my amendment is moved. You can determine to vote for it or against it, but let us be clear about it: those on the government benches who say that the amendment that I will be moving shortly is of no effect might also like to explain the $6 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million difference between the anticipated costs in this financial year and the $12 million in the following year. They might also like to explain why somebody who is applying for a home loan in August should not be able to access the $80,000 limit instead of the $40,000 limit, because you said you would have it in place for them on 1 July. You might also like to consider a range of other initiatives which you seemed somewhat supportive of before the election but have gone very cold on since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This one provision for a home loans subsidy for defence personnel was actually part of a bundle of initiatives that the Labor government was addressing before the last election. They arose from the Glenn review, established by former Minister Punch. During the Glenn review he identified a range of issues that required improvement if&mdash;as I said at the outset of my speech&mdash;we were to ensure that defence personnel conditions kept pace with their needs and with contemporary employment practices. One of the things that was mentioned then was, in fact, an increase in the maximum amount available under the defence home owner scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 10 December last year the then minister, Minister Punch, issued a statement on behalf of the Labor government undertaking to implement that commitment. But it was not just that one commitment, and it was not in isolation. This is not a bandaid approach that we should be looking at to address the needs of defence personnel issues. This was part of a coordinated approach to ensure that the net of services and benefits and remuneration available to people in defence was the best to attract high quality people and to retain them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we also gave commitments to child care, to occasional care, to family day care and to an ADF spouse employment program. We gave commitments in relation to exemption for ADF members from changes to the superannuation preservation rules. We also gave commitments in relation to improvements in compassionate leave, the extension of education assistance provisions, the introduction of reunion travel for dependent tertiary students, the introduction of spouse emergency travel, the introduction of pre&hyphen;posting travel for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3265"> members with special needs dependants, an extension of the remote locality leave travel provisions and the removal of the anomaly in tax rebates for United Nations deployments. All of these things were part of a coordinated approach Labor was committed to prior to the last election&mdash;one of which was the improvement to the home loan subsidy scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support your bill. We support the improvements to the home loan subsidy scheme. We are waiting to hear what you are going to do about the rest of the coordinated approach, because either you are going to do this piecemeal or you are going to place bandaids over situations as you can&mdash;or, as I fear, you are going to endeavour to sidestep the entire Glenn review process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, I understand that people in defence these days are not allowed to call it the Glenn review any more. Someone in the ministerial wing feels somewhat offended by that reference. I am not sure whether that is because they do not like the government that it was previously produced for, they do not like its recommendations or they feel uncomfortable with Mr Glenn. They did not feel uncomfortable with the name `Glenn report' before the election, though. Again, in their election manifesto, in their `Defence Personnel' section at paragraph 6.4, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recently released Glenn Review identified the need for a long term strategic personnel policy which appropriately recognises the importance of manpower as a defence asset.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> in addition to other measures identified in this policy the Coalition will implement a long term strategic personnel plan in accordance with the principles identified in the Glenn Review.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister, where is it? You have gone AWOL since the election. You do not let people talk about the Glenn review any more. You have not come out with a coherent policy statement in relation to personnel. But I should not be surprised at that. You have not come out with a coherent policy in relation to defence strategic matters either. So I guess it should be little wonder that we do not have one on personnel&mdash;and you now take bits and pieces in an ad hoc way and present them to the parliament. Minister, we will certainly look at those bits and pieces and will be happy to support those that make good sense. This bill, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as far as it goes, makes good sense and will have our support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not go far enough on two counts. It does not go far enough because it does not honour your election undertakings, which you made great play of during the election campaign. You should not deceive those people in uniform whom you gave that promise to, and this afternoon you can rectify that. It does not go far enough because it is ad hoc and piecemeal. It is taken in isolation, and it does not address in any coherent and considered way the problems which Glenn identified in his report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, as there are so few bills on defence matters that come before the chamber, you might like to take this opportunity to set out your views on defence personnel matters as the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. You might like to enlighten the parliament. I am sure many people in uniform are waiting to hear a coherent statement on what the considered and collective view of the government is of the many recommendations in the Glenn review. Do you endorse the undertakings given by the previous government in December of last year when Minister Punch made the response to which I referred? Do you endorse those? If you do not endorse all of them, then which ones do you endorse? If you want to extend beyond those recommendations, we would gladly entertain a discussion on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us not deal with defence personnel matters on an ad hoc impromptu basis. Let us not do it by the bandaid method. Let us have a considered, planned approach. If the aim and direction of your approach is to ensure that the defence personnel of the three services are properly remunerated, are properly rewarded and are better placed to do their job as our greatest asset, then you will have my support and you will have the support of the opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 and believe that, as in so many other ways, it reflects the total commitment of the coalition to examining the circumstances of those who serve in the Australian Defence Force. It certainly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3266"> does provide, in the second major component, an opportunity for those who are disadvantaged by the frequent moves, which seem to be part of a service career, to acquire their own home and to maintain it and to act far more in pari passu with those who are in the community than would otherwise be the case&mdash;that is, in civil employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two components to the bill, and I want to address each of them briefly. The first, of course, relates to the Defence Force disciplinary legislation and the Defence Force Discipline Act, which is a very important part of trying to ensure that the criminal law provisions that pertain to all members of the community pertain equally to those who are members of the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the change reflects is, in fact, the paradox of our not having federal criminal law. It has always seemed to me to be rather strange that we are in the position where there are differences, be they minor, between the different states. Of course, this legislation began by the application of so much of the New South Wales criminal law as is applicable to the Jervis Bay territory. I am not aware, and I have not gone into the particular detail, but I had always thought the criminal law for Jervis Bay and Canberra was the same. I presumed that, because they chose Jervis Bay&mdash;and there is, of course, a very significant naval presence within the Jervis Bay territory&mdash;there must be some reason for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time the legislation was last before this House I cannot recall why we decided that it should be the Crimes Act 1900 that applied to the Australian Capital Territory's application to the Jervis Bay territory rather than looking at the Crimes Act 1900 as it applied to the Australian Capital Territory. I do not know what the nuance of that is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significance of this amendment is to ensure that there are no shortfalls in legislative competence as far as any existing prosecutions are concerned. While it has only briefly been referred to by both the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) in her introduction and by the spokesperson for the opposition, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), I think <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it is important that we try to ensure that there is an understanding across Australia of what criminal law provisions affect those who are in the Defence Force, as much as an understanding by those in the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the life of me, from reading it I have been a little bemused to know what the significance of this change is, other than picking up those for whom there may be some ongoing prosecution. The nature of the change is obviously one on which there can be little debate. I think it is important that there be a maximum understanding of what criminal law applies to what person and where. I question the extent to which there is some particular difference, other than the fact that the Jervis Bay territory is now part of the ACT and the ACT is now an independent territory and whether that has given it some peculiar significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nature of this change in the face of the legislation that is before us is a little hard to comprehend. I think it is probably more hard to comprehend because the ACT is a separate territory. It does seem a little odd that we are now deciding that it will be the criminal law of the Australian Capital Territory rather than New South Wales and its application to the Jervis Bay territory. I am not too sure what the practical outcome of that is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the change, but I am interested to know what is excluded were the legislation to be just the law of the ACT rather than just the law of the ACT as it is in force in the Jervis Bay territory. Any legislation should be comprehensible and understandable. In this sense we are moving from the application of a state law, although it was particularly applicable to the ACT, to one that brings affairs more up to date. It therefore is one which no doubt is more related to prosecutions under way and, apparently, some shortfall. There is nothing in the explanatory memorandum, the minister's speech or otherwise to explain why we are doing it this way, other than, I presume, that because the ACT is a separate territory it is necessary to pick up the fact that Jervis Bay has changed its territorial status as a result. Why we need to keep the specific reference to Jervis Bay, I am not sure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3267">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the bill is the substance of the legislation, and it is on that that I wanted to make a few remarks. I really have not been able to follow the amendment that was foreshadowed by the honourable member for Brisbane. As I understand the effect of the passage of the legislation, the legislation will apply to any individual applicant from the date of the approval of the loan. The terms are being changed so that the eligibility is reduced in the period of years of service, there is a new category for reservists and the amount which an applicant is entitled to receive is also being increased. There will also be a spouse's joint entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand the effect of the legislation, until it is passed by this place there is no capacity to make an application. If there is no capacity to make an application, it means that until we have passed this legislation both here and in the Senate no application will be made. If you date it back to 1 July, you cannot make an application between 1 July and 20 August because the legislation has not gone through. If the legislation has not gone through, the effect of your amendment is not to enhance the eligibility of an individual in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the form of words that you have used, I do not frankly follow the purport of the change. While I understand that it might be a political point and relate to an election undertaking, it would only have been applicable had the legislation been passed during the last sittings and the date of assent to the bill had in some way been postponed to after 1 July. Once it has been passed by this place, subject to passage through the Senate and the process of approval by the Governor-General, you then need to apply and any application will be dealt with according to the terms of eligibility that are now prescribed within the legislation. Those terms will ensure that the individual, subject to meeting the criteria which are set down and which are now changed and are made more generous&mdash;justifiably&mdash;will have exactly the same entitlement as if you dated it back to 1 July because they cannot apply until after 20 August. I might be wrong, but that seems to be my understanding from reading the legislation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the amount, I suspect that that is because in the nature of things, it being 20 August, there will be some delay between now and the time the legislation is put into practice by the Department of Defence. Any applications made will necessarily begin from the time of their approval. Presumably, that will mean that the first application may not be until some time in September. There are inevitable battles of scrutiny, so you have at least missed one-third of the year. Whether that is the reason for the particular sums being given and the cost, I am not sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect, knowing most of these schemes, that people who might well wish to apply are not all going to be processed immediately. I suspect that next year there will be an ongoing processing, which will commence from 1 July. In the present financial period it is unlikely that all those who may be eligible will have their applications in and will be processed in the normal course once the legislation is enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significant part of the legislation is designed to ensure that there is an additional entitlement for service people to overcome that inevitable move that takes place in their careers every two years. I must say that when the Defence Housing Authority legislation came before this House I was very apprehensive as to whether or not it would provide a change in the quality of residential accommodation available to those who rent. As I understand it, the quality of defence homes today is much better than it was&mdash;it needs to be&mdash;and so we can say that the Defence Housing Authority has done a remarkable job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the housing was antiquated. Much of it dated from World War II. In particular, single and married quarters on defence facilities were inadequate to meet the parallel standards that one expects in the services, especially with the additional hazards and obligations that service people have compared with their civilian counterparts. It was essential that a great deal of additional funding be provided. It was also necessary to dispose of a lot of those antiquated houses. It is always difficult to measure the effectiveness of defence housing. However, from wandering around the defence bases&mdash;as I do from time <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3268"> to time&mdash;I know that there are still some that need to be upgraded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One aspect that I would like to comment on is the difficulties with the education of children. Also of concern is the degree to which it is easier for a partner to get a job on some bases than it is on others. While there has been a significant improvement in the quality of housing, there are still difficulties in trying to ensure continuity in education and employment for the families of defence personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That really takes me back to my first observation about the degree to which criminal law varies from state to state, even if it is to a minor degree. Basic costs for defence personnel being transferred still need to be addressed. It has always seemed to me, for example, that the qualifications of some professions are too state oriented. It is quite ridiculous that people who are qualified nursing sisters in Victoria have to be readmitted if they are transferred from a naval base in Victoria to one in Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people take their motor vehicle, it has to be reregistered in the state to which they are posted. If people go from a school in one state to a school in another state, because of the relativity in the level of education, someone in fifth class in a school in New South Wales who transfers from a naval base there to one in Western Australia will find that the courses available and the level of education will not be quite the same. There is inevitable disruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have long felt that we need to find a way to accommodate those who are transferred from state to state&mdash;and not just those in the defence forces, although it certainly applies to them. Those who are at a state level of administration need to register that while there are differences around Australia they are imposing undue and often harsh penalties on those who, for one reason or another, are transferred interstate. Often people find that their families, because of the circumstances of their employment or the opportunity for their family members' education, are pressured into deciding to linger somewhere else. In many instances that means that there are defence personnel whose families live a long way from them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do that because they want to try to achieve a normal life. It means that they want to provide continuity of education for their children. A child in Year 11 in New South Wales, whose parents are in the services and who are transferred interstate, will find it difficult to complete the HSC in the time it would normally take. The pressure to complete your education to a certain standard means that there are times when families suffer. Certainly the service person who is moved finds it a wrench to decide whether to accommodate the desires of the family or to meet the obligations of the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another way in which this could be overcome. Where transfers are to be made, the position of families should be taken into account by those who are posting them. So the posting should be made at a time of the year when the education of children would not be prejudiced. That still does not overcome the difficulty of motor vehicle registration, professional qualifications and necessary state registration obligations, nor some of the other facets related to the differences that exist state by state around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, there is little doubt that the provisions in this legislation, which expand the opportunity for individuals within the services to have a greater opportunity to fund their own homes, reflect a step in the right direction. It is one to which the coalition is committed and one which I welcome, both in the additional funds made available and also to the extent to which it means that there is a more equal chance for defence people to acquire and own their home and to follow their careers without being as disadvantaged as they are at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many have been able to use their superannuation to buy a house after they leave the Defence Force. Today, the degree to which you can commute your pension and acquire adequate funds to do so are more limited than they once were, and there is a greater tax obligation. For that reason, I think the opportunity of giving them this subsidised loan during a stage of their career when they have a chance to get a title to a home while they are still in productive employment in the services is desirable in a social as well as an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3269"> economic sense.

<PARA>This Budget implements the key election commitments of the Coalition and it does so as part of a responsible economic strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The focus is savings&mdash;savings for investment, sustainable growth and real jobs. This Budget turns around failure and sets us on a winning course.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">BUDGET REPAIR</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget outcome for the past year was a deficit of $10.3 billion. If we took no corrective measures it would be $9.6 billion this year. We would still have an underlying deficit of 2 per cent of GDP even though the economy has had five years of growth. Debt would be increasing and Australia would be dangerously exposed to shifts in the international outlook or sentiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In periods of growth we must put away savings for the downturns. But far from saving, the previous Government kept rachet ing up our debts&mdash;spending money it didn't have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our predecessors had Australia on a path of deficit and debt to the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake, this path would only make future choices harder, future possibilities bleaker and rob Australians of the future opportunities they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our Government could not stand back and ignore the problem. Although we did not create it, we will take the responsibility to fix it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures I announce tonight will reduce the underlying deficit by around $4 billion this year and $7.2 billion over two years. These measures will balance the budget over the term of this Parliament. These are the net effect on the budget bottom line after the introduction of new policy to meet the Coalition's election commitments. These measures represent a historic turnaround in Commonwealth finances. In 1997-98, outlays will have fallen around 1.8 per cent of GDP, while revenues will have risen only 0.2 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget repair will be achieved principally through expenditure savings with a contribution from reduced tax expenditures and measures to curb tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, Mr Speaker, there is no increase in income tax rates, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in the wholesale sales tax rates and no lift in the petrol excise. There are measures to tighten eligibility and clamp down on misuse, but the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme remains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, you don't turn around a nation's finances, a nation's future without making some hard decisions. But if we avoid the hard decisions now they are only going to get harder in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tightening measures have to be fairly shared. We cannot expect those who rely on pensions and allowances&mdash;low income earners&mdash;to bear the cost. So we are asking high income earners to make a contribution and business to make its contribution too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures are balanced, strong and fair.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Financial dishonesty of that magnitude undermines public confidence in our political system. We will ensure it never occurs again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our Government will enact a Charter of Budget Honesty that will require the government of the day&mdash;ours or any other&mdash;to publish a budget update signed off by the Secretaries to the Treasury and the Department of Finance at the commencement of each Federal Election campaign.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">HEALTH</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And our commitment to families doesn't stop there. The Government will implement major improvements to Australia's health care system. Medicare will remain, bulk billing is unchanged. But people will be given greater choice to take out private health insurance. This will stem the declining rate of health insurance and secure the funding of our health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1 July 1997 we will be providing income&hyphen;tested rebates for the cost of private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eligible families will receive up to $450 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These incentives, together with the Family Tax Initiative, will make a qualifying single income family with two young children better off by more than $50 a fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For couples the rebate on health insurance will be up to $250 a year. For singles the rebate will be up to $125 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, higher income earners who can afford to take out private health insurance will also be encouraged to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a 1 per cent Medicare levy surcharge for couples with combined incomes of over $100 000 (individuals with incomes over $50 000) who do not take out health cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the levy which the Government hopes no-one will pay. It is entirely optional. Those who take out health insurance (with the benefits attached) will be exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Government's role in protecting the health of Australian families has been significantly boosted in this Budget which delivers all the public health commitments of the Government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I wish to underline the Government's commitment to older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight's Budget demonstrates this by continuing twice yearly indexation of the pension and making financial provision to maintain the age pension at or above 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings across the forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will ensure that the living standards of those who receive a full or part rate pension keep pace with community standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, there is another group of older Australians who have saved for their own retirement, have low incomes and pay tax at a much lower threshold than those on the pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Government will provide this group of self&hyphen;funded retirees with the same tax rebate as the pensioner rebate, in two stages, commencing with a half rebate for 1996-97. Those low income aged people who qualify for the rebate will receive their full rebate for the 1997-98 income year taking a qualifying single person's tax free threshold from $5 400 to $11 185.</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">SMALL BUSINESS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, the Government is committed to helping small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has already met its commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor to 6 per cent so that small business no longer is assessed for provisional tax on income in excess of what it has earned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will deliver $180 million back to provisional taxpayers in 1996-97.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Government also has legislation in the Parliament to remove the job-destroying unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1 July 1997 capital gains tax rollover relief will allow small businesses to rollover their business assets without capital gains tax disincentives. This relief from CGT is designed to allow small businesses grow bigger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many small business proprietors plough all their savings into their business which is both their livelihood and their retirement savings plan. Recognising this, the Government will allow individuals to claim an exemption from CGT, up to a maximum capital gain of $500 000 on the sale of a small business where the proceeds are used for retirement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, tonight's Budget will directly help regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As promised during the election campaign, the Government will increase assistance to isolated students. From 1 January 1997 the Primary and Secondary Correspondence Allowances under the Assistance to Isolated Children Programme will be increased by $1 000 per annum and $1 500 per annum respectively. At the same time, the non-means tested basic boarding allowance under the Programme will be increased to 55 per cent of average boarding fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In accordance with our election commitment, budget funding for National Highways and Roads of National Importance will enable us to provide $75 million per annum for the next 10 years on a dollar for dollar basis with New South Wales and Queensland to upgrade the Pacific Highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Budget provides $36 million in real terms in each of the years 1996-97 to 1999-2000 for the Road Safety Black Spots Programme in accordance with our election commitment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures I am announcing tonight are designed to make superannuation fairer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major deficiency of the current system is that tax benefits for superannuation are overwhelmingly biased in favour of high income earners.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Government will provide an 18 per cent rebate for up to $3 000 of contributions made by a person on behalf of his or her low income spouse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will be of particular benefit to women outside the paid work force who are currently denied access to their own superannuation plan. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Government will also extend from 65 to 70 years the age limit up to which those in the work force can make superannuation contributions. This will address the current discrimination against older Australians who are still in employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To enhance competition and choice in superannuation, the Government will introduce Retirement Savings Accounts. These will be a simple, low cost, superannuation product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Government will maintain the Superannuation Guarantee at the levels and time frame currently legislated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Superannuation Guarantee threshold, at $450 a month, is too low. People on very low incomes are being forced into superannuation which is unlikely to provide a retirement income when their pressing need is to maintain current living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Government will allow employees with incomes between $450 and $900 a month to choose between Superannuation Guarantee contributions or the equivalent as wages and salary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, in 1992 the previous Government legislated tax cuts into L.A.W which have never been paid. In last year's Budget it was claimed they would be paid into superannuation between 1998 and 2000 for employees paying 1 to 3 per cent of their take home pay into superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our Government will encourage employees to make these superannuation contributions from their take home pay and has made provision in the forward estimates for the co-contribution. But the Government will review the mechanism for the delivery of the L.A.W tax cuts to ensure they are paid in an equitable and effective way. They will be paid into superannuation or like savings vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, these changes will provide a much fairer superannuation system and one which more readily meets the differing circumstances of individual Australians.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After a long period in the doldrums, investment in housing is expected to begin to recover during 1996&hyphen;97. Notwithstanding the savings measures announced in the Budget, public sector demand is forecast to strengthen in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farm sector is expected to grow at a solid rate, following the recovery last year from the drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The continuing strong growth in our major trading partners will result in another year of very strong export growth. Imports will pick up in line with the strengthening in domestic demand and the rapid growth in highly import intensive areas of investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of solid investment the current account deficit is expected to show only a modest improvement in 1996-97, and at 4 per <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent of GDP remains high, reflecting the structural weakness that our fiscal consolidation programme is designed to address over time.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr Downer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Australian Government believes that there is an urgent need for a peaceful resolution of this tragic conflict so as to protect civilians throughout Sri Lanka, irrespective of their ethnic identity. The conflict is primarily one for the players in Sri Lanka to resolve but we are taking every opportunity in our ongoing contacts with the Sri Lankan Government to encourage progress towards a negotiated resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Australia is already providing substantial emergency humanitarian assistance to large numbers of people displaced by the conflict in northern Sri Lanka. This assistance is delivered through the ICRC and other non&hyphen;governmental organisations. In April 1996, Australia shipped 2 000 tonnes of wheat to Sri Lanka to assist with food shortages caused by conflict and drought and in May, Australia provided A$1 million to UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres to assist victims of the conflict. Given ongoing hostilities and the unpredictable nature of the conflict the Government does not consider it would be desirable for a delegation to visit the North or East of the country at this time. A parliamentary delegation visited Sri Lanka in October 1995 and held discussions on a range of issues including the ethnic conflict and Australian development assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The fact that this issue was not addressed at the most recent CHOGM, in Auckland last year, was criticised by me at that time. Australia will look closely at the possibility of a role that an impartial body such as the Commonwealth might play in assisting a peace process in Sri Lanka. The Australian Government would see value in third party mediation in the conflict particularly through the Commonwealth, provided that international mediation was acceptable to both the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE, and that both sides were willing to engage in genuine negotiations on substantive issues.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (b) Widening of the F5 to six lanes between Brooks Road and Camden Valley Way is not yet considered warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Department has discussed the issue of additional ramps south of Brooks Road on the F5 freeway with the Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales (RTA) with a view to a possible joint funding proposal between the Commonwealth, the New South Wales Government, relevant councils and private sector developers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discussions with the RTA have established that the existing 4&hyphen;lane capacity of the F5 between Brooks Road and Camden Valley Way is adequate for traffic movements at present but its widening to 6 lanes needs to be kept under review. Delays during peak periods can be experienced northbound due to a combination of high traffic volumes on the Highway and the weaving movement caused by the large number of trucks entering at Brooks Road which has then to cross the traffic exiting at the Camden Valley Way interchange. Some improvement in these conditions is anticipated in 1996/97 when the State Government funds construction of an eastbound off load ramp from the M5 to the Hume Highway at Casula as an alternative to the exit at Camden Valley Way. The weaving movement will be reduced by northbound traffic continuing on to the proposed new ramp in lieu of exiting at the Camden Valley Way.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) In the event of a major emergency at or in the vicinity of Sydney Airport, the NSW Medical Emergency Plan will be activated: this is a subplan of the NSW Disaster Plan (DISPLAN). Under the plan, the NSW Department of Health will arrange for casualties to be sent to hospitals around Sydney, including the St George Hospital. The decision on which hospital is chosen for individual casualties will be based on bed availability, the nature of the injury and the urgency of treatment. This decision will be made by medical personnel at the emergency site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">St George Hospital and other nearby hospitals will also each provide an emergency medical team to attend the airport to triage and treat the injured prior to transportation to hospital. Each hospital only provides a single team so as not to strip the hospital of emergency staff and the number of teams will depend on the number of casualties involved in the emergency. A rough rule of thumb is one team per 40 casualties.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr Tim Fischer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) There were 22 signatories to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement as at February 1996. These were: Canada, the United States, Japan, the 15 member states of the European Union, the Republic of Korea, Israel, Switzerland and Norway. Singapore, Liechtenstein and the Kingdom of the Netherlands with respect to Aruba have applied for membership.  Chinese Taipei has applied to accede in the context of its WTO accession negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The agreement covers thirty&hyphen;seven (37) states of the United States as well as the Federal government.  A list of entities in the states which procure in accordance with the provisions of the agreement  appears in WTO document, WT/Let/57 of 19 January 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes. No signatory has offered 100 per cent of its government procurement for coverage under the agreement. In most cases, signatories have adopted a positive list approach in nominating the entities and sectors covered. The Annexes to the agreement provide details of the coverage agreed for each signatory in terms of purchasing entities, goods and services. Annex 1 lists central government entities and sets out any qualifications that have been placed on coverage of goods procurement by those entities. Annex 2 deals with sub&hyphen;central entities, Annex 3 with government enterprises, Annex 4 lists services covered and Annex 5 lists construction services covered. The General Notes attached to each signatories' offer lists specific derogations and exceptions as well as reciprocity conditions negotiated. The annexes for each signatory and the General Notes are included in and form part of the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement. Amended Annexes 2 and 3 for the US and Annex 1 for the European Communities are provided in WTO document WT/Let/57.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No. The operation of the agreement does not affect Australian industry development programs as Australia is not a signatory to the agreement and is not required to join it. Should the Government decide to seek accession to the agreement, industry development programs which involve offsets as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> described in Article XVI and footnote 7 of the agreement could be affected. However, the Article would not have any effect outside the coverage of the agreement, for example in relation to exceptions to the agreement and exclusions or derogations negotiated by the parties. In order for a program to be affected it would need to be applied by entities nominated by Australia, involve sectors nominated for coverage and involve procurement above the stipulated threshold value applicable to the entity. No decision has been made by the Government on membership or non&hyphen;membership of the agreement and no consideration has been given to the details of potential coverage at this stage. The Commonwealth's discussion paper, Australia and the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (DFAT/DAS, May 1995) provides a discussion of the issue in the context of potential implications of membership of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The issues of equal employment opportunity, occupational health and safety and environmental stipulations in purchasing have been examined by officials in the context of the on&hyphen;going review of the implications for Australia of possible membership or continuing non&hyphen;membership of the agreement. While certainty on such matters can only be achieved in a negotiation process, it is DFAT's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3291"> assessment that accession would not affect Australia's policy flexibility in relation to these matters if their preparation, adoption or application were not with a view to or with the effect of, creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3301">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The majority of departments do not have this information readily available, with the exception of the Department of Defence which produces such information on a monthly basis. The Department of Finance, however, produces a quarterly report listing permanent staff, by agency by location. The most recently produced report details staff numbers as at December 1995. As it is unlikely that the figures provided would vary by more than 1.5 per cent between December 1995 and 1 March 1996 (given that the entire change across the APS for the 1995 calendar year was 1.4 per cent) the answer to the honourable member's question is based on the data sourced from the Department of Finance report, with the exception of the Department of Defence. I have also included the total number of temporary staff employed by each agency as at December 1995 although the data for temporary staff is not readily available in a disaggregated form by State/Territory.</PARA>

An attempt to provide an overview ahead of the delivery of the Budget would not give a useful representation of reductions. The government's objective is to reduce the cost of government as part of a thorough and necessary overhaul of expenditure. The level of expenditure will be considered as part of our deliberations on the Budget, and there will be some reduction in staffing levels across the public service. The extent to which compulsory retirement, as opposed to voluntary retrenchment, may be necessary is impossible to estimate at this time. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3302"> </PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) There are 13 Nomad aircraft remaining on the Australian Register, as listed below. CASA does not maintain information on the role of individual Nomad aircraft.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Yes, an Airworthiness Directive (reference AD/GAF N22/69 Amendment No. 2) issued by the then Civil Aviation Authority imposes flap setting, weight, and speed restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Australian operators have been advised and are required to comply with the Airworthiness Directive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulatory authorities of countries where the Nomad is known to be operated have been informed, as is the usual practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Various structural modifications have been incorporated into the Nomad aircraft, these being determined necessary by the manufacturer, and mandated by Airworthiness Directives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has not yet been determined if a structural modification is required as terminating action for AD/GAF N22/69 Amdt 2. This will be determined on completion of ASTA Defence investigations regarding wind tunnel and flight test programs on (1) loads on ailerons and (2) flutter characteristics of aileron/wings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pending the outcome of the tests, a strengthening modification may be required of the aileron. This also would entail static structural test/analysis of the new modified aileron and an evaluation of the flutter characteristics of the modified aileron.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)(i) The National Rail Corporation (NR) has advised that it owns no locomotives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)(ii) NR has advised that the number varies from day to day. Some 200 locomotives are normally in use by NR on hire from the Australian National Railways Commission (AN), the NSW and Victorian rail systems and private firms. For example, on 31 May 1996, locomotives available for long term NR use were:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">from AN: 10xAN class, 10xBL class, 14xDL class and 14xEL class;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">from NSW: 13x81 class, 19x422 class, 48x80 class, 16x82 class and 4x48 class;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">from Great Northern Railway: 2xT class (ex Victoria).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">NR hires additional locomotives to meet peaks in demand. Currently, a further 10x82 class locomotives are on short term hire from NSW and AN provides locomotives equivalent on average to about 25,000hp per day for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">NSW also provides 86 class electric locomotives as required for trains on electrified lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)(i) Valuers have been engaged to value assets, including locomotives, nominated for transfer from AN and the State rail systems to NR. The valuers have advised that they could find no evidence of any arm's length transaction of used interstate freight locomotives less than 20 to 25 years old in Australia other than for scrap. Since neither these locomotives, nor any like them, have been traded, it is not possible to say what their market value might be.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) It is the Government's objective to encourage new migrants to settle outside capital cities. Closure of smaller area offices is expected to have very little if any impact on this objective. Under the existing specific regional migration scheme, the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme, nominations by employers for overseas skilled migrants are processed through the Central Office of my Department and the actual migration application processing is undertaken either at overseas posts for offshore applicants or in the State or Territory offices for onshore applicants. There are similar arrangements for processing associated with regional concessions available under the Business Skills category and with the offshore Concessional Family category. Further initiatives on regional <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> migration that may arise from a review to be undertaken by a Joint Commonwealth/State/Territory working party set up by the Ministerial Council of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ministers will similarly be adequately catered for under existing processing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The closure of small regional offices in non-metropolitan areas, servicing relatively few clients will free up resources to enable improvements to be made in service provision across Australia. For example, resources will be channelled to support a national immigration telephone inquiry service accessible to clients anywhere in Australia for the cost of a local call. Most immigration services do not require face-to-face service. Those services which cannot be provided over the telephone can be provided in other more innovative ways which avoid dependence on a costly network of offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department already has in place linkages with other organisations with Australia wide networks to provide a quality service. Australia Post, for example, accepts applications for Australian citizenship. The Department also funds a network of Migrant Resource Centres, a number of which are located in non metropolitan areas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The Department provides assistance to new migrants settling in regional Australia through its funding of an infrastructure of Migrant Resource Centres (MRCs) and Grant-in-Aid (GIA) agencies which provides information and referral services to meet migrants' initial settlement needs.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are 35.5 Grants-in-Aid and nine MRCs operating to service the needs of migrants in non-metropolitan areas across Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) In 1994&hyphen;95 SBS showed 13.42 hours of Croatian programming. This represented 0.23% of total programming time and 0.47% of programming time in languages other than English.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">SBS advises that there has never been a high level of production of suitable program material in Croatia, or in any other region of the world which has a sizeable Croatian population.

The lack of programs is due primarily to the recent war and the resultant lack of funding for film making.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Tourism has become the main commercial use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park over the past decade in terms of the number of vessels, people and structures it employs. Use of the Marine Park by tourists has grown from about 150,000 visitors in the early 1980's to about 1.5 million in 1995/96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This growth in use of the Marine Park has resulted in the management agency, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, implementing a number of strategies in order to keep pace with the predicted 10 pc per annum growth in tourism&mdash;whilst balancing the need for protection of the unique environment of the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority has responded to this increased use in a number of ways. In 1993/94 a visionary 25 Year Strategic Plan for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area was developed and is now being implemented by stakeholder groups. The Strategic Plan set 25 year and 5 year objectives for the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of the World Heritage area. The Plan is supported by more than 70 government and non-government agencies, interest and user groups and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Strategic Plan is acknowledged as a world first in participative regional planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is divided into four sections each of which is subject to a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3326"> detailed zoning plan. Zoning plans are one of the Authority's prime tools for managing multiple use of the Marine Park. A major review of the Zoning Plan for the Far Northern Section of the Marine Park is currently being undertaken and a number of minor reviews of the other sections of the Marine Park are also underway. In addition the Authority has also developed management plans for high use areas such as offshore Cairns and the Whitsundays. Other measures such as delineating `no anchoring' zones, designating `no structures' subzones and declaring moratoriums on the issue of new tourism permits in the high use areas, are providing the Authority with a broader range of planning and management instruments and with breathing space to properly consider longer term management strategies with which to control the effects of increasing use of the Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another of the strengths of the Authority's management of the Great Barrier Reef is the close working relationship it has with the Queensland Government and Queensland management agencies that extends to the adoption of complimentary management plans for areas under the jurisdiction of each government and a jointly funded arrangement for the day to day management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park that enables Queensland officials (generally Department of Environment officers who are Marine Parks rangers) to act on behalf of the Authority within the area of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A review of tourism use of the Marine Park is also about to commence. This review will be conducted in partnership with the tourism industry and will, among other things, aim to develop a strategic tourism use policy and management mechanisms.</PARA>
