<ELECTORATE> (Bennelong&mdash;</ELECTORATE>
<ROLE>Prime Minister)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.27 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, it is with very considerable pleasure that, on behalf of the government and in my first remarks to this new parliament as Prime Minister of Australia, I extend to you the congratulations of the government parties on your election. You have been a very distinguished and effective member of the House of Representatives since your election to the seat of Casey in 1984. I have known and observed your work in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government parties in our earlier manifestation in opposition. You bring a background in the armed services of Australia. You bring to the job of Speaker a considerable affection and regard for the institution of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity in congratulating you to reaffirm a number of the things that I have said about the importance of reasserting the supremacy of the parliament over the executive&mdash;and I say that very deliberately. It is part of our system of government that the executive is controlled by parliament and parliament controlled by the law and the customs and conventions of our society. I think it is important that steps are made on both sides of the parliament to reassert and re-establish a degree of respect and regard for the institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that, for my part but without in any way abandoning the proper role of robust debate and the natural and legitimate right of any government to advocate with passion its own political cause, this is a parliament comprised of a government and an opposition. There is a role in the national parliament for proper and full expressions of view from both sides of politics. I will, to the best of my ability, extend proper courtesies to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), to all members of the opposition and to the independent members, who are greater in number on this occasion than in any of the parliaments that I have sat in since my election in 1974. I can say to you, Mr Speaker, that you will have from me and from the members of the government cooperation and support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said during the election campaign and previously, I would like to have a far more independent role for the Speaker&mdash;and that is not meant to reflect adversely on people who have gone before you in that role. I simply say that I would like the Speaker to be as independent as possible. I know that you have already announced some steps that you propose to take to give some substance to that, but the real substance of whether or not we have an independent Speaker in this place depends upon how the Speaker behaves, how we behave and how we behave towards each other. Putting aside the formality of it, the substance of independence by you will be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5"> asserted by how you conduct yourself and how you dispense fairly and equitably the standing orders of the parliament. If they stand in need of change over time, then the government is willing to, in proper consultation with the opposition, consider that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you would already be aware that the government proposes to sponsor a change to the standing orders to allow a more free&hyphen;flowing reporting of what goes on in this chamber by television and radio networks and in fact to resurrect some proposals that were adopted by one of your predecessors, only to be summarily jettisoned by the government of the day. We will have great pleasure in reasserting those because we thought your predecessor was right on that particular issue and the former government was wrong. I say to the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin): you were absolutely right, Stephen; you really were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that we intend to do, of course, is to return question time to 2 o'clock in the House of Representatives. I should confirm to the parliament, as I have to the people of Australia, that I will be in attendance, barring unforeseen circumstances, at every question time when the parliament sits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So to you, sir, it is with a genuine degree of warmth that I congratulate you. I know that you will bring enormous commitment and personal dedication to the job of Speaker. You respect the parliament. You respect the office to which you have been elected. You understand its history. You understand its traditions. You understand the need for it to be filled with a degree of fairness and propriety to both sides, respecting that at the end of the day it is important, if we are to have an increased national esteem for the political process in this country, that both sides of the House and you and the three of us together do our level best to bring that about. Congratulations. I wish you a long, meritorious and uninterrupted service for several parliaments into the future in your newly chosen and newly elected role.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his congratulations to you, Mr Speaker, on your elevation. We on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this side of the House view your elevation with pleasure. We have known you for a considerable time now. We have always found you to be a person who deals straight with people and we have every anticipation that you will continue to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Westminster system you sit in this parliament in an office of very high importance. I think those of us who love and know the parliamentary tradition think back to Speaker Lenthall and his confrontation with the Crown. He informed their agents that he had neither eyes to see, nor ears to hear, nor mouth to speak, except as the House of Commons directed him. That was a standard of courage which Speakers have attempted to emulate ever since. You sit there in Speaker Lenthall's tradition and, as a result of that, as well as your own personal attributes, we respect you and look forward to your conduct of the chair over the next parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also understand that you are here as something of a living symbol of some elements of the Prime Minister's humour. It did not strike us as immediately likely, when the Prime Minister during the election campaign announced an intention to support an independent Speaker, that we would in fact find the Chief Whip of the coalition parties sitting in that place. We thought that the Prime Minister might have had something else in mind when he discussed an independent Speaker in that mode.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see a new interpretation of that has emerged from the Prime Minister, and that relates not so much to the symbols of the office but how you might ultimately decide to conduct yourself. I think the public might have been looking forward to either the appointment of one of the Independents or perhaps something altogether different and an altogether different tradition being established, perhaps something along the lines of the British House of Commons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House have no particular objection to the Prime Minister not appearing to decide to proceed down that line, basically because we have always been quite satisfied with the system that produces the Speakers. Therefore, we are quite cheerful to find the Prime Minister emulating our past <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6"> practices. We do not find that a difficult thing to live with at all. We suspect he might find it somewhat difficult to live with, but we do not find it difficult to live with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with joy the Prime Minister's assertion of the superiority of the parliament over the executive and I look forward to manifestations of that as this proceeds&mdash;for example, manifestations of decisions to refer to the Procedure Committee changes to the standing orders before implementation or debate in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally speaking, we chose when we were changing standing orders to refer those to the Procedure Committee. So we will be providing an opportunity tomorrow, when the standing orders get placed, for a gesture from the parliament as to whether or not there will be an assertion of the parliament over the executive by a reference of those standing order changes to the Procedure Committee. Whether or not parliament subsequently decides to accept the recommendations of the Procedure Committee is another matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, we also know that you are a manifestation of the Prime Minister's sense of humour in another area. You are going to be one of the few members of the Liberal Party actually voted on to achieve a position of high office. We understand indeed that the chairmanship of parliamentary committees will not be the subject of a vote from the Liberal Party but be by appointment by the Prime Minister&mdash;the Privileges Committee and all the other parliamentary committees associated with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an interesting thing from two points of view. Firstly, there might be a question mark in the mind of the public about whether or not this is yet another manifestation of the Prime Minister's sense of humour when it comes to conveying a view that there is a superior position in the parliament as far as relationships of the executive are concerned. The other aspect of the Prime Minister's position on this is one that we would fully comprehend: if you took a look at the Liberal Party, would you want them voting for you in the best of circumstances? Answer: no, you could not trust them with a vote. But, Mr Speaker, they have trusted you with a vote on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this occasion and it is a good thing that you have emerged from it, even though I understand there was some reluctance on your part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, within the tradition of Speaker Lenthall and others at the time who had to be put in the chair at sword point, you attempted to place there your former superior as Minister for Defence, and I do praise you for that noteworthy allegiance to your former commanding officer. I note in that regard you failed, but you at least did your duty. As an indication of your willingness to do your duty in this chamber, it was a very good sign to the rest of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want you to know that we will completely settle for the interpretation of standing orders that we heard you so frequently give as Chief Opposition Whip. There was an interpretation of the standing orders&mdash;on questions of relevance and the like&mdash;that we found quite delightful. I note from the comments that you have thus far made in public that you have an intention to follow those down the line, as well as being a strict disciplinarian, and we can live with that too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our congratulations go to you. We understand too that you are going to wear robes but not a wig. You are one of the members of this chamber who can delight in the fact that a wig is not necessary, either physically or symbolically. We are prepared to go along with that halfway house to the common touch of the Speaker as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I end where I began. We have some knowledge of you in your dealings with us over the years. You are an excellent choice for Speaker. You are an honourable, decent human being, a man of great direction, and we think that you will grace the chair.</PARA>

You were commissioned in 1957 and promoted to Squadron Leader in 1966, Wing Commander in 1974 and Group Captain <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7"> in 1979. There are few of us now in the parliament who are ex-service men or women or returned service men or women, but it is a particular delight to me that you come from the junior service&mdash;the Royal Australian Air Force&mdash;and that you are well equipped from that first&hyphen;hand experience in those demanding roles of Squadron Leader, Wing Commander and Group Captain to now act as Speaker of this House of Representatives, Speaker of the Parliament of Australia. I congratulate you and congratulate you on behalf of the parliamentary National Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a pity, as we set out in a new parliament, that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) strayed. I do not propose to respond, because it is a historic occasion which deserves honour, other than to point out that you, sir, have decided to withdraw from the meetings of the party of which you are a member in taking up your role of Speaker. I commend you on that decision. It is a decision not taken lightly and one which stands you well as you take up the honourable responsibility of Speaker of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have every confidence, Mr Speaker, that you will carry out those duties with a fair application of the standing orders, which duties will involve a two-way cooperative contract with the members. I am sure that on this first day of the parliament members will set out with the right intentions to cooperate with you in helping you to discharge those very difficult and challenging duties. We wish you well and extend our greetings to your family. We know that you will enjoy the confidence of the House, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said, for many years to come.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8"> By way of passing comment, I was interested in the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the implementation of committee reports and the putting of proposals to parliamentary committees&mdash;in particular, the parliamentary Standing Committee on Procedure&mdash;for consideration prior to implementation. In fact, the matters about which we have given notice have been to the Procedure Committee, were recommended by the committee and, of course, were not approved and taken up by the previous government. For example, the return to the previous general practice of presenting second reading speeches is just one of the many matters about which we will implement the committee's recommendation. The allotting of specif ic time for grievance debates is another. We look forward to joining in debate in a robust way but within the confines of the standing orders, and we hope the Leader of the Opposition's memory can be extended back beyond 2 March.</PARA></SPEECH>

I am not sure whether I will ever publish a book and include them; nevertheless, I have still got them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I would like to offer you one or two words of advice in a very serious vein. The first is that your responsibility goes well beyond just the maintenance of control in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chamber, as you will find out. You are responsible, either individually or severally with the President of the Senate, for the welfare of every person who works within this building. You have four departments of state to run. In difficult economic times and in government policy terms, that is going to be a real challenge for you to administer. But in that role you have departmental heads who will give you absolute, superb and loyal service. I can go no further than to suggest to you that any time the Clerk of the House of Representatives chooses to give you advice, if you stray from that, you do so at your peril. In terms of people who can keep you on the straight and narrow, there are none better than these three sitting here, in terms of control of this place and administration of the parliament and what this institution means. I know they will be not only willing to do so but also straining at the bit to get to you and give you some of that advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are others, of course, who will be more than prepared to do so. I do not know whether it is by good fortune, good luck or mismanagement, but I have been allocated a seat close to you. Whilst I said behavioural standards in this place depend on us all, there is nothing like an ex&hyphen;Speaker sitting close by to whisper advice occasionally to you. It will be unbiased, it will be fair, it will be impartial.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by again saying to you that from my perspective the position of Speaker to which you have now been elected could not have gone to a better choice from the other side of the parliament&mdash;indeed, from within the whole House. I think you are an honourable person. I have had the opportunity to work closely with you in this place since 1984. I have had the opportunity to talk with you at length on issues which have been of concern to me in my former life as the Speaker. I know we share the same sorts of values <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9"> about the importance of the parliament and this parliamentary institution. I wish you success. I am available at any time for consultation. I do not know whether you will choose to take that up, but I hope that you do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to speak for the people of my electorate and the people of the nation.

We're giving you'&mdash;the then opposition&mdash;`an opportunity to run the show with honesty and integrity.'

As a former party colleague of yours and having served for some time in the whips office, I have grown to respect your capacity for hard work and your honourable approach to your duties, particularly when you served as the Chief Opposition Whip.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I have spoken to you in recent times to ascertain your approach to the functions of the office of Speaker and, in particular, on your views as to the question of the independence of the role of Speaker. I have read and listened to your comments in the media since your election&mdash;certainly since your election as a coalition nominee for the position&mdash;and, obviously in the chamber today, I listened with interest to the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Although the position that the Prime Minister and you have signalled for your work is a distinct improvement, there is still somewhat of a gap between what has been indicated today and what was promised by the Prime Minister during the recent federal election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, as an Independent member of this House, my rights to represent my constituents will depend very heavily on your application to the independent role of Speaker. It is absolutely clear in my mind that the vast majority of the Australian population expect a great improvement in the way in which we all conduct ourselves and the way in which this chamber conducts itself. Likewise, there is an expectation which has followed the election of the new government that the perceived and real shortcomings will be dealt with in the spirit of the Prime Minister's statements before and during the federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, finally can I just say that you are only too aware, as the Prime Minister has indicated, that in this chamber is the largest group&mdash;minus one, at the moment&mdash;of elected independent members since the parliament of 1929. In fact, if you took out the independent members who were identified as either independent nationalists or members of the Western Australia party, I believe that this would be the largest group of elected Independents since Federation. I might add that in the records, there are no official reports of party affiliation of members by the Department of the House of Representatives until 1956, so there may well be some inaccuracies in some of the earlier records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might just point out, Mr Speaker, that we, the Independent members, will be making a submission to you on the administrative <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> processes relating to the procedures of the House and, in particular, the administrative arrangements for the Independent members that were applicable in the previous parliaments which were administered then by the then Chief Opposition Whip, who was yourself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to report that the House attended His Excellency the Governor&hyphen;General in the Senate chamber, when his <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Excellency was pleased to make a speech to both houses of the parliament. I have received a copy of the speech, which will be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  for record purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators and members of the  Parliament of Australia: at the request of the Prime Minister I depart from the prepared text of this speech to make specific mention both of the sadness which envelopes the opening of the thirty&hyphen;eighth parliament and of the profound sympathy which all associated with the parliament feel for those affected by the Tasmanian tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Introduction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 2 March the Australian people entrusted to a new government the responsibility of managing the nation's affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In doing so they endorsed decisively a comprehensive programme of practical reform. The Liberal and National Parties will keep faith with the people and implement that programme. Today I outline some aspects of the government's legislative programme as well as its approach to governing the country in the years ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The members of the government have believed for some time that action needs to be taken:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to boost the competitiveness and productivity of the Australian economy and thereby deliver higher economic growth and higher living standards;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to raise national savings;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to lift burdens from the small business sector so that it can generate new jobs; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to tackle the longer term environmental challenges such as soil degradation, salinity and the protection of our coastline and waterways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a society rich in resources of all kinds. We should not have to settle for a lower level of economic performance than other countries with fewer advantages. The government's policies aim to fulfil people's aspirations by rewarding hard work and initiative, achieving rising living standards, affordable home ownership, and a more positive future for our children. The needs of Australian families will be placed at the centre of the national policy agenda. Small business will be promoted as the dynamic engine of our economy which can offer new jobs and opportunities for many Australians. In particular, more young Australians will have the opportunity to fulfil their talents through rewarding jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government set out the framework of its plans prior to the election, and it intends to implement them. This task has been made more difficult by the fact that it is inheriting a prospective Budget deficit of $8 billion. That added burden, however, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="16"> will be tackled in a balanced and sensible fashion through prudent and responsible management of the national Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Jobs growth, opportunities and living standards</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reform of the labour market is essential to creating jobs and raising living standards. Higher efficiency and productivity will raise our international competitiveness and open up new export opportunities. The government is determined to introduce its promised practical reforms in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reforms will give Australian employees the prospect of higher wages based on higher productivity within a framework of guaranteed minimum standards. They will also make it easier for employees to blend their family and workplace responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industrial relations legislation, to be introduced early in the life of the Parliament, will promote genuine co&hyphen;operation between employers and employees, provide greater scope for workplace agreements and give all Australians greater choice and more incentive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compulsory unionism will be abolished. Genuine freedom of association will be guaranteed. The unfair dismissal provisions of the current legislation will be replaced with a system that is fair to employers and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective sanctions against secondary boycotts will be restored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's Plan of Action for Small Business will, in its turn, enhance job growth and economic opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will reduce red tape, unnecessary paperwork and regulation identified by a new Small Business Deregulation Task Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also take steps to reduce the complexities and compliance costs imposed by the taxation system (particularly the Capital Gains Tax and the Fringe Benefits Tax) which have a disproportionate impact on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A more competitive economy is crucial if we are to overcome Australia's still severe current account deficit problem and therefore over time reduce our foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's agenda for microeconomic reform, especially in the telecommunications and transport sectors, will have a significant role in improving competitiveness:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the government will work with the States and Territories to ensure that the momentum of competition reform is further developed and duplication is reduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the government will also introduce legislation to facilitate the sale of one third of Telstra. Telstra will become a more competitive <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> company in the global telecommunications market and Australian consumers will benefit through a more efficient communications sector; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> waterfront reform, greater airport efficiency, improved roads and better gas and electricity operations will all lift productivity and, as the reforms take effect, there will be greater demand for skilled labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To assist in meeting this demand, employment programmes will be more effectively linked with the mainstream training system. Apprenticeships and other work&hyphen;based training opportunities for young people will be strengthened through the Modern Apprenticeship and Traineeship System. Older unemployed people will have access to labour market programme assistance and support services. Pilot Regional and Community Employment Councils will bring together business leaders, education and training providers and representatives of the wider community to more effectively link training of unemployed people with real jobs and with regional development plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While employment prospects are enhanced for people seeking jobs, activity tests for unemployment assistance will be stringently applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Families, the community and the elderly</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reducing the economic pressure on families, especially those with dependent children, is one of the government's most important and pressing tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes that strong family life offers the best support and welfare system yet devised. The new family tax initiative will reduce the tax burden on low and middle income families with children by ensuring that more of their income is tax&hyphen;free. It will particularly assist one income families, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's plans to make private health insurance more affordable will ease pressures on Medicare, improve access to health care and help reduce waiting lists for public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government remains strongly committed to the maintenance of Medicare, bulk billing and community rating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States, Territories, service providers, carers and volunteers are essential to the delivery of effective health and community services. The government will work co&hyphen;operatively with them to ensure the coherent and efficient promotion of better health throughout life, to improve childhood immunisation rates, to develop strategies further to combat domestic violence and to expand the availability of marriage preparation and ongoing relationship programmes. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="17"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A comprehensive retirement incomes policy will ensure that older people have financial security in retirement. For people who elect to work longer than the normal retirement age, there will be provision for deferred pension entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will also act to ensure that self&hyphen;funded retirees will receive the same tax treatment as pensioners on identical incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Young Australians</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policies and measures mentioned earlier will do much to ensure that young Australians have greater cause for hope and confidence in their future and that of their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issues of youth unemployment and youth alienation will be at the forefront of the government's priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further support for the concerns and difficulties of youth, particularly homelessness and youth suicide, will be an important priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes it is vital to ensure that young Australians have access to a world class education and training system that will give them the capacity to secure jobs and to maximise their creativity and productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Promoting excellence in educational standards, fostering greater diversity of choice, a strong commitment to equality of opportunity for all students, a greater focus on literacy and numeracy skills in primary schooling and the availability of school English language programmes for newly arrived migrant children are all important and practical elements of the government's approach to education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A coherent, nationally agreed framework for vocational education and training will meet the needs of industry and business enterprises. TAFE will be supported as the key public provider of vocational education and training and industry's involvement in the training system will be strengthened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Regional Australia</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our nation continues to depend on the natural and human resources of rural and regional Australia for a major proportion of its wealth. There is a responsibility in the interests of all Australians to develop those resources in a sustainable and environmentally sensible way. The government will meet that responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will help to restore the nation's land and water resources infrastructure and enhance our primary industries by removing impediments to international competitiveness and by working in partnership with industry to maximise export opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will remove export controls on all mineral commodities except for uranium and nuclear <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> materials. New uranium mines and exports will be approved subject to strict environmental, heritage and nuclear safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Implementation of the National Forest Policy Statement will ensure a scientifically based, comprehensive and representative forest reserve system and an ecologically sustainable forest industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An historic and comprehensive environment and sustainable agriculture programme will have as its centrepiece the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. It will be a Trust in perpetuity to be funded by the partial sale of Telstra. It will constitute an unprecedented national commitment to the protection and rehabilitation of Australia's unique natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Defence, international relations and trade</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no higher responsibility for the government than effective action to ensure the security of the Australian people and the protection of their interests. It will do so through a realistic defence policy, a constructive foreign policy and an active trade policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence policies will be based on self&hyphen;reliance, strong alliances and close ties with our friends. The government is committed to enhancing the mobility and operational capabilities of the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The promotion of a strong defence industry base and an effective capacity for defence research and development will be essential elements of the government's approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foreign and trade policies will focus on improving national prosperity and security in a practical, focused and co&hyphen;operative way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's perspectives will be global and its focus will be regional. While further developing relations with Australia's traditional partners, there will be no higher priority for the government than advancing relations with countries in Asia, with particular emphasis on Indonesia and other members of ASEAN, Japan, Korea, China and India.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will work closely with Australian exporters and industry groups to develop market opportunities for Australian exports and to overcome specific barriers to trade or investment in overseas markets. It will do so through bilateral regional and global negotiations. It attaches particular importance to APEC as a forum for trade and investment liberalisation in the region that will also act as a catalyst for further global trade liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">A cohesive society</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's commitment to govern in the national interest, and not for vested interests, will build community confidence and respect for the rights of all Australians. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="18"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the measures and policies so far described are aimed at promoting the interests of the Australian community as a whole. As they are implemented, they will add to national prosperity, mutual trust and shared achievement to which the government believes all Australians are entitled to aspire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the government will promote other measures which will encourage cohesiveness, rather than division, in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will work to give Australian women greater equality of opportunity to succeed and genuine choice in their lifestyle, their aspirations and how they share family responsibilities. It will be advancing these goals in all policy areas and particularly in industrial relations, health care, superannuation, taxation and education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we gather in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, we acknowledge the continuing culture and unique role of Australia's indigenous people in the life of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will continue to promote the processes of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and will act to improve the well&hyphen;being of indigenous communities in the areas of health, housing, education and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments will be made to the Native Title legislation to ensure its workability. These amendments will honour the basic principles of the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will continue to develop the great strengths which are derived from cultural diversity in the Australian society while reaffirming the unifying values we all share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government also considers that the arts and culture should be accessible to all Australians, and not be the preserve of a privileged few. Its regional arts initiative and its emphasis on young and developing artists will be important elements of this approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also determined that the community should have a greater say in the design of constitutional reform proposals. By the end of 1997, the government will give the people a new opportunity to have their say about their Constitution and their system of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, the government will introduce legislation early in the new Parliament to protect Australia's flag and to ensure it cannot be altered without the people's approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, it is particularly appropriate at this time and in this place to mention the government's intention to improve the standing of the national Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a regrettable fact that, for various reasons, increasing numbers in the community have lost respect for the Parliament and its members. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will take steps to restore that respect. It will do so without in any way reducing the scope for robust debate which is one of the most valued features of our democratic tradition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is confident that its programme of practical reform, some of which I have outlined, will vindicate the confidence and support shown by the Australian people at the recent election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These policies, and the many detailed aspects of the programme not mentioned in this address, are designed to unite and harness the capabilities of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is deeply conscious of the great responsibilities it has been given. It is determined to address the national challenges we face.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In nominating the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), I draw the House's attention to the 12 years of service that Mr Nehl has given to this parliament. Most people who know him would know of his sterling service to and his care and concern for the parliament. People have seen him acting in the Deputy Speaker's position and they know that he has the concern of the parliament at heart. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="19"> He wants to elevate the parliament to the position at which the Australian people would like it to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people who have seen the member for Cowper around the parliament, especially with school groups, will know that he desires to impart to the young people of our nation a great consideration for the parliament. He wants to tell them exactly what the parliament means and the place it plays in our democracy. I suppose it is a bit of a standing joke that, through his contact with school groups visiting parliament, the member for Cowper has probably had his photo taken more often than any other member of parliament. I think every refrigerator in the seat of Cowper has on it a photograph of Garry Nehl with a school student.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is also in the Australian Parliamentary Antarctic Alliance. A lot of people here have been to the Antarctic with Garry Nehl and a lot would like to go to the Antarctic in that alliance. The Garry Nehl slide show is well known throughout the electorate of Cowper and throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to mention Mr Nehl's wife, Sue. Like the spouses of most members of parliament, she has had a great deal to put up with over the years. Many members will be able to relate to the fact that he celebrated his 40th wedding anniversary the other day at a Crescent Head Lion's Club function in his electorate. We would all understand that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with a great deal of pleasure that I nominate the member for Cowper for the position of Deputy Speaker and I wish him all the best in his future endeavours.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.04 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In seconding the nomination of the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), I mention that it is coalition tradition when in government to have this position filled by the National Party. There are many distinguished previous occupants of this position from the National Party and, previously, from the Country Party. I remember in that position Sir Charles Adermann from Queensland and Phillip Lucock from New South Wales and, of course, who could forget Clarrie Millar in that position. Nobody <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had a better command of the English language than Clarrie Millar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fitting that this position be taken by a person who occupies the seat of Cowper. Cowper is a federation seat. It has only been held by the ALP for one term&mdash;from 1961 to 1963. There is a certain longevity in terms of people holding this seat. I believe that Sir Earle Page held the seat of Cowper for 42 years. Ian Robinson held the seat for 21 years. The member for Cowper has been here since 1984, and I can see many fruitful years ahead of him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Handbook</EMPHASIS> shows that the member for Cowper has had a long and distinguished parliamentary service. He has served on party committees, parliamentary committees&mdash;standing committees, joint committees&mdash;and also in party positions and parliamentary party positions. He is also an author of note. Some of his publications include <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Banana Coast</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Timbertown</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Coffs Harbour: The Natural Growth</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is devoted to his electorate. He started his political career in local government service. This experience, and the fact that he has been on the Speaker's Panel for six years, will be a great help to you, Mr Speaker, in running this chamber in the way which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has promised the Australian people. I commend the member for Cowper for this position.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have very great pleasure in proposing Mr Jenkins, the member for Scullin, to be Deputy Speaker of this House. He has already served in the distinguished capacity of Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees from 4 May 1993 to the expiry of the last parliament, and prior to that he served as Deputy Chairman of Committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have personal pleasure in nominating Harry Jenkins because Harry was one of that group of members who came into the parliament at about the same time as I did. He was elected at a by-election following the retirement of his father, who was a distinguished Speaker of this House, but really he became part of that class of 1987. It was a small group of members who arrived in 1987 and we looked to our own company to make <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="20"> friends and to form a basis of solidarity in the new parliament at which we had recently arrived. Some of my colleagues of course are no longer here: my very close friend Michael Lavarch&mdash;</PARA>

Of course, anticipating this reaction, I mention that the most luminary of the class of 1987 was John Hewson, who left rather early after sentencing the then opposition to a period of another three years on the opposition side of the House. To join the parliament at a time like that, with a handful of new members, means that you see personal friendships form and the way in which your friends are able to carry the burdens that come with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Harry Jenkins, in the roles that he has played in this House, has handled himself with distinction and honour. He has been one of those people of whom I have read very little by way of criticism in his handling of the management of this House. When he has served as Deputy Speaker and Acting Speaker of this House, his conduct has always been impartial towards both sides of the House and he has handled himself in an exemplary way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In putting forward this nomination, I was looking back through some of the early press clippings where it said, `The junior Jenkins goes to Canberra.' This was a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> from the days just before his preselection. Harry always had that rather disingenuous innocence about him and he said, `I simply put my name forward. I knew there were a lot of things which could happen, but I had to take my chance.' He has taken his chance and has done extremely well. When he was asked about ambition he said, `Frontbench? No, not immediately. At 33 I think I have time to take it quietly.' To a question about the speakership, he laughed and said, `I don't know about that. I have to be a student of the parliamentary process for a good while before I could consider that.' Harry has been a student of the parliamentary process now for some considerable time. He <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has distinguished himself. I am sure that when we are re-elected to government ultimately he will be an excellent contender for the speakership of this parliament and will serve in that role with distinction. I look forward to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In proposing Mr Jenkins, let me also do honour to Garry Nehl, whom I know well and who I believe is well respected by both sides of this House. He has a sense of humour and a character which is accessible to all members, and I believe that he will give distinguished service in the position that he will be shortly elected to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the motion on Tasmania which is to be moved shortly&mdash;I understand there are only two speakers&mdash;it would be remiss of me while I am standing on my feet on this first occasion in the parliament not to at least express on behalf of all my Tasmanian colleagues, and I am sure that I reflect the views of all members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, the great sense of distress that we personally feel and the distress which is felt by all members of the Australian public.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, at the outset I congratulate you on being elected to the Speaker's position in the House. It is pleasing from our side of the House that you have been so rewarded. From those who have observed your capacity to organise the numbers for others in what was the opposition, it is pleasing that that skill was not lost when it came to your own position.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Indeed, if this independence that you are asserting bears fruit, I might even come and seek your advice myself at some stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gives me great pleasure to second this nomination. I have known the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) for a long time but have been involved with him in this House since 1990 when I came to this place. Since that time he has held the positions of Deputy Chairman of Committees in the parliament from 1990 to 1993 and also Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees in the last parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also comes, for those that it matters to in this place, from a very proud political family. Those of us who have come here via <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="21"> that route understand the knowledge that can be imparted by going down that route. I therefore think that what we have in this nomination is a person who has shown in that capacity fairness, strength in the position of the chair and, most importantly, a command of the procedures of the House. I think that, together with you, Mr Speaker, and Mr Nehl, the member for Cowper, the member for Scullin will provide an excellent contribution and quality of candidature, and hopefully one will see the House operating in good shape over the course of this parliament.</PARA>

I led the then opposition, in my first attempt as leader, in a by&hyphen;election against him at the beginning of 1986&mdash;and did not make much of an impression.

It is a delight to see that the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), who has been shouting at the chair for such a long time, is now able to get up there and shout back. He is one of those members who, by his own personal endeavours, has managed to overcome the considerable difficulties with acoustics in this chamber. For years as the Leader of the House, I was never able to do that, and the fact that we have somebody in the chair who can do that without much assistance is not a bad thing. I also endorse the things that were said about him. The quite delightful way that he has made absolutely certain that the interests of penguins have been well represented here means that there will be a good team at the top.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most experienced member of that team which will handle the affairs of this House is the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins).

I believe that, with the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), the Second <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Deputy Speaker, and the Speaker's Panel, we will be a very effective team, because I know that we share the desire to improve the standards of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to pay tribute to the former Speaker, Stephen Martin. I believe that, while he had his trials and tribulations, he did his absolute best and made a very good fist of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, I say to the member for Scullin, as did the Deputy Prime Minister, that I have very fond memories of his father. As the Deputy Prime Minister said, he provided great kindness to me and all the other new members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to endorse what the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) said about the member for Scullin. The member for Scullin did serve as Deputy Speaker with distinction and with honour. I applaud him for that, as I also applaud the Deputy Speaker before him, Ron Edwards. He is no longer a member of this parliament, but he served as Deputy Speaker with distinction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot conclude this list of people to praise without mentioning Clarrie Millar. Clarrie was highly regarded as the Deputy Speaker by both sides of the parliament. I must say that his incredible skill in the use of the English language has become desuetudinous since he departed. I will seek to do as well as he did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I would like to say to you and to all members of this House that I am passionately devoted and dedicated to democracy. Some mention has been made about the school groups that I take around Parliament House. Last September I had groups from 17 schools here, and I bashed all the children's ears about democracy. I do it all the time, because I believe that our form of parliamentary democracy is the best that we can possibly have. If you stop and think about the election we had on 2 March&mdash;when we had a massive changeover, with one government out and another government in&mdash;you will note that not one person was killed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not be taking one lead that you have given, Mr Speaker: I will not be withdrawing from the activities of my parliamentary party. I will go on to explain why: the group that I hunt and run with within the caucus is in the minority, and it would be very self-indulgent if I were to deny that group that additional vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all seriousness, I appreciate that I was put forward by the caucus and was elected unopposed as the nominee of the Labor Party.

I will attempt to assist both you, Mr Speaker, and the Deputy Speaker in as best fashion I can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to refer to an incident from 29 March of last year when there was an allegation abound that perhaps I, as Acting Speaker in the Speaker's absence overseas, received some advice.

<PARA>It would not be right for this parliament to proceed any further without some reference, in a completely bipartisan way, to these enormous events. I say on behalf of the government that few occurrences in Australian life have shaken the nation quite as much as this. I think Australia has been shaken to the core. I think these events removed any vestigial sense of innocence that this country may have had that in some way it was untouched by some of the individual insanities and crimes that beset other societies and beset other nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an occasion for all of us to reflect upon the humiliation that it brings to us as a nation and as a people and for us to try in a constructive way to learn lessons from it and to address those issues that such a tragedy produces. And not least of course is the vexed issue of gun control laws. Whilst this is not an occasion for me to initiate a debate on that, I would not be doing the right thing by this parliament if I did not repeat to it what I said in the press conference I held yesterday: I will do all that I humanly can as leader of the government to bring about a significant improvement and to address some of the great deficiencies that exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When something as enormous as this occurs it does cause all of us to reflect upon some characteristics of our society. In doing that, we address matters relating not only to gun control law but also perhaps to the repetitive, mindless, numbing depiction of violence in some elements of our mass media. I am no psychological expert, I am a mere layman and an individual in these matters, but I find it very hard to believe that some of the excesses of that depiction do not have deleterious consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a tragedy which will force all of us to address some issues&mdash;I hope constructively and not in a knee-jerk fashion.  It is impossi&hyphen;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>ble not to feel a sense of great emotion about something such as this. There can be few things in life more innocent than a pleasant Sunday afternoon in a remote, isolated area of this country. To think that violence of this magnitude could be visited upon such innocent behaviour and, in so many instances, people who were living in the older and twilight periods of their lives is something quite shocking in its dimension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to place on record the appreciation of the government and I am sure all members of the House for the tremendous work done by the Tasmanian police. Police services around the country have had some difficulties and have been seen in a very negative light by some. An event such as this&mdash;the awful task of collecting bodies and arranging identification by grieving next of kin&mdash;places an enormous emotional strain on people involved. To those people, I express the gratitude of the government. To the doctors, nurses and hospital staff who are doing such a magnificent job at the Royal Hobart Hospital and other hospitals, I also express the gratitude of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of all I extend the deep sympathy of the government and of all Australians to those countless people, both here and around the world, who have been left bereaved by this event. It is something that has shaken this country to its core. The very least that I think all of us can do, and particularly we who have responsibilities in this parliament, is to try in a constructive and, if possible, bipartisan fashion&mdash;and I do not say that lightly; I mean it&mdash;to address some of the difficulties that arise and some of the issues that have been thrown up by these dreadful events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Particularly to the people of the small community of Port Arthur and to the state of Tasmania, I extend on behalf of the government our profound sense of sympathy and solidarity with them at a time of such immense trauma and distress.</PARA>

It is an extraordinary thing that at this time of a parliament, generally speaking, whether you have won or lost in terms of who forms government or opposition, it is a joyous occasion. The start of a new parliament is a joyous occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a real celebration of Australian democracy. A statement is made about the direction the nation will take over a few years. Our families turn up in large numbers. The children are there and are given a reasonable bout of licence in the galleries. Probably for the last time during a session of parliament there is everything there that identifies us as individuals in this chamber with the life of the nation generally, before we are cloistered in what is essentially a monastic atmosphere for the bulk of the time that we are here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is a really poignant point for us to be contemplating the devastation of family lives and of hopes, fears and opportunities that went with the slaughter of those poor people in Tasmania. It is absolutely fitting that we should therefore have at least had the opportunity to gather ourselves collectively here with our families to express our total identity with what those people have experienced over the last few days. It is going to be a very long time before that community can purge itself of the terrible trauma that this tragedy has imposed on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No place in Australia deserves to have this happen. Nowhere in the world deserves to have an occurrence like this. If you could think of the least likely place in Australia for it to happen, that is where it happened. If you could think of the place where it was most likely to extend the sense of trauma, that is the place where you would likely expect it to happen. So it will be required of us all&mdash;long after these things leave the headlines and long after the sense of emergency that grips the nation when it immediately confronts an issue like that&mdash;as the people who are responsible for the life of the nation, to have this tragedy stay at the forefront of our thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the Prime Minister on bringing forward the meeting of police ministers. We wish him well at that. We were not successful with the police ministers in our efforts to get from them national gun laws. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We did attempt that and were not successful. We do think now that the pressure upon them to arrive at the right conclusion is going to be very great and I do believe that the Prime Minister in his endeavours will enjoy success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he does not, I would ask him to contemplate the offer made by the Premier of New South Wales to take upon ourselves federal powers in this regard. I understand his party's concern with that and it is, in part, embedded in the ideology of the Liberal Party that they would act with great reluctance as far as that is concerned. But we would in no way regard it as a precedent of an embarrassing nature to be utilised in debate if the government decided it was necessary to make an exception at this time. These issues are beyond attempting to make the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also understand&mdash;and I think the Prime Minister covered this in his remarks&mdash;that this is not a matter that will be resolved by better gun laws alone. There are other elements of the culture, other problems and mental health issues raised here that we need to consider. There are also issues of a culture of violence in our community. I saw some extraordinary statistics which bear out what the Prime Minister was saying the other day. The statistics, which applied to the United States, but our programming is exactly the same, showed that teenagers in the United States&mdash;and having watched mine in operation, I do not think it is any different here&mdash;watch 21 hours of TV a week and that they consult their fathers in privacy for five minutes a week and their mothers for 20 minutes a week. By the time they are 18 they will witness, in that 21 hours, 18,000 violent deaths. If there is anything in our understanding of the 20th century that propaganda works and creates a climate, we have to give at least some contemplation to that set of facts when we contemplate the nature of a community that can suggest this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="26">  Even though murder is as old as recorded history and mental illness is as old as recorded history&mdash;and this gets back to the point I made about the meeting with police ministers&mdash;there is no doubt that the scale on which these events occur is, at least in part, influenced by the technology of it. A murder ous person with a knife is a much less dangerous person than a murderous person with a machine gun. Therefore, even though gun control issues are not ultimate solutions here in any shape or form, they are part of the solution. It does not give me any pleasure to support the Prime Minister's remarks, but I do nevertheless strongly support that this is an event that none of us would want to happen. As I said before, the opposition wishes him well in his endeavours.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To drive along the road from Hobart through Sorell to Port Arthur is to see a very beautiful part of Tasmania and Australia. I want to recount two accounts of couples who took that particular drive last Sunday. Simon and Susan Williams happened to be driving along that lovely section of road when, on reaching the historical precinct of Port Arthur, they saw the gunman running amuck. They could not drive out of the way and made the split&hyphen;second decision to speed up, drive past him and keep going to the end of the parkway just near the entrance to Port Arthur. The gunman took one shot at them which hit Susan in the left hand, passed through her left hand and hit Simon's left hand as well. Today they are both in hospital in Hobart receiving excellent care and are in good spirits, apart from their residual shock.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am authorised to say that those two people are the Canadian counsellor and his wife. On behalf of the government, I extend our sympathy to them and to all who have been affected, injured and killed in this horrific saga&mdash;particularly to the Canadian government. I know my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has communicated with them as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The second group, which was brought to my attention by the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), were not so lucky. They were on a well&hyphen;deserved holiday and were at long last in Tasmania. They came from Redcliffe in Sunraysia. The families do not want their names to be known, but I think the House and the nation should know that there were many heroes at Port Arthur on Sunday and Monday.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened in this case was that the gunman had broken out and was firing shots at random. These two men, perhaps on their first holiday for a long time, took desperate action to protect their wives and their wives' lives. Their wives lived, but they lost their lives. I know the member for Mallee and all of us join with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in extending our deepest sympathy to all the families and friends of those killed and injured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We salute those who had to carry the burden of police work, emergency services work, fire brigade work and a whole raft of other activities&mdash;especially those helicopter pilots being fired upon during dangerous low altitude flying, which had to take place because victims had respiratory injuries and the like. An extraordinary number of heroes came from this horrific saga. But it is now our duty, both at the federal and state levels, as reflected in the comments of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, to analyse away from this emotional moment and find out exactly what is behind these horrific happenings, previously in Hoddle Street and Strathfield and now in Port Arthur on a tranquil Sunday afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Finally, I say to the people of Tasmania, and indeed to all those directly and indirectly affected: your spirit has been very sorely tested by these horrific events. People in the Port Arthur precinct and down on the peninsula have a particular cross to bear out of all that has occurred, but you have shown great spirit as you seek to bounce back from this enormous tragedy. We wish you well and acknowledge that you are truly great Australians in coming to terms with an horrific occurrence. We will help in every possible way, shape or form to ease the burden arising from this saga.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for giving me, the local member, the opportunity to speak to this motion and to express the shock and grief that Tasmanians are feeling as a result of the tragic and violent shooting that took place at Port Arthur during the day and night of 28 April.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="27">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing could have prepared our community for such an event. Tasmania is a quiet, peaceful and picturesque island and its population, along with the thousands of tourists, spend a lot of time enjoying the history and the ambience of our heritage places on weekends and holidays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such was the scene when a crazed man began to take the lives of Tasmanians and tourists alike. I cannot put into words the full shock and anguish that I felt when hearing the news. But no&hyphen;one will ever fully understand how the families and friends of those who lost their lives feel. It was so sudden, so shattering and so final&mdash;with no time to say goodbye. No&hyphen;one should have to go through the terror and the confusion that were felt in those hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What causes someone to go out and kill complete strangers? I doubt whether we will ever really know. Fifteen such incidents where more than 10 people have been killed by a lone gunman have taken place around the world in the last few years. There are no boundaries&mdash;no ethnic groups, no obvious type&mdash;that can explain this madness that leaves so many people to mourn. There is no explanation&mdash;only grief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a belief in Tasmania that we are safe and secure down there, that we have been sheltered from this sort of violence, but that dream has been shattered forever by this terrible event. The Tasman community is very small and close&hyphen;knit. Everybody knows everybody else and most have friends and relations scattered right across the island. They are all in mourning. We are all devastated. Our thoughts and sympathies go out to those families and their friends who have lost a loved one or who have been injured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fitting for the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to visit Tasmania at this time, representing everybody in the parliament. I welcome their support and their respect for those who have died. I know that the Mayor of the Tasman Municipality, Neil Noye, and his council will appreciate the motion before the House. I extend to them particularly my condolences and my support during this difficult period. He and other local leaders have an enormous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> task ahead of them. Time will heal the raw pain, but nothing will erase the memory. We must do everything we can to help the local people come to terms with an event which is beyond all our understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our thoughts go out to all those families from interstate and overseas who have been involved in our darkest hour. We must say to them: in your pain we share a common bond, and that bond should not repel you from Tasmania but bring you back to feel the healing properties of our island state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand a service will be organised by the local community on the peninsula in the near future so that all Tasmanians can share in the mourning process and offer support and solidarity to that community. In unity we find strength&mdash;strength to overcome this sadness and build a safer society. I believe this has been a challenge to members of parliament, both state and federal, to take on the burden that has been forced onto Tasmania and to act decisively to ensure that nothing like this can happen again in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to all Tasmanians, particularly those on the Tasman Peninsula, that my commitment is to you and my thoughts are with you. To those emergency services, the police, the ambulance, the fire brigade, the hospital, the counsellors and all the many people involved during and after this terrible event, I extend our gratitude and support. Yours was a job in hell and you did your tasks with a dedication unsurpassed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sentiments of all parliamentary members and, I am sure, all the staff in the parliament, are combined in this special motion for Tasmania. I thank members of the House for their support and commend the motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on Thursday, 18 April 1996, of the Hon. Sir <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="28"> Hubert Ferdinand Opperman, OBE, Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Corio, Victoria, from 1949 to 1967; Government Whip from 1955 to 1960; Minister for Shipping and Transport from 1960 to 1963; and Minister for Immigration from 1963 to 1966, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Hubert Opperman was born at Rochester, Victoria, on 29 May 1904. He began his working life as a messenger boy for the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS> . Over the 92 years of his life, he was to distinguish himself in two separate but very demanding fields. He became, on any measure, one of the most outstanding sporting figures that this country has produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a salutary reminder to me, when I attended the memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne, that the passage of time and the removal of the present generation from earlier generations can rob you of an understanding of the sporting achievements of people in earlier years, even in such a sports crazy nation as Australia. To hear, as I did at the memorial service, the eulogy delivered by Peter Bartels, to be reminded of the immense sporting achievements of Hubert Opperman back in the 1930s and how, by any measure, he was world class unsurpassed in the cycling field, was yet another example of the proud sporting traditions of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert Opperman's cycling achievements were numerous. He held the title of Australian road cycling champion in 1924, 1926, 1927 and 1929. He captained Australia's Tour de France team in 1928 and 1931. He won the French Bol d'Or race in 1928 and the Paris-Brest-Paris marathon in 1931. He set a new record for riding between Lands End and John O'Groats in Britain. Also he won the Bidlake Memorial Prize in 1934. All of those great achievements took place more than 60 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert retired from cycling before most people in this House had been born. He retired from cycling in 1940, but not before breaking more than 100 records in a 24-hour cycling marathon around the old Sydney velodrome. At least one of his cycling records remarkably still stands today, making him <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> without doubt one of the great national sporting legends of the Australian experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert served in the Royal Australian Air Force from 1940 to 1945. He was commissioned in 1942 and held the rank of Flight Lieutenant when he was discharged in 1945.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert entered federal politics as the member for the division of Corio in 1949. He held that seat until his retirement in 1967. His maiden speech in parliament was characterised by his concern for the less fortunate Australians: those in rural areas, pensioners, war widows and war veterans. He believed passionately in a united Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert served this Parliament for 17 years. Apart from his service as government whip and his ministerial appointments in the Menzies and Holt governments, he also served on many committees: Joint Committee on Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, 1956-1960; House Committee, 1956-1960; and Printing Committee, 1959-1960. He was also a trustee of the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust from 1959 to 1960.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1967 Sir Hubert resigned from parliament to become Australia's High Commissioner to Malta, the first to hold that position, until 1972. Many distinguished parliamentarians have passed through this chamber, but few could claim such remarkable achievements in a multitude of careers&mdash;in sport, in politics and in the service of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1953, in recognition of his outstanding service during Australia's Golden Jubilee Celebrations in 1951, when he was given the complex and difficult task of organising the sporting section of the celebrations. Sir Hubert received his knighthood from the Queen in 1968.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert was a person whose experience covered 92 years, two world wars, a great depression and the years of postwar reconstruction. He played a very significant role in dismantling the White Australia policy&mdash;and that is a part of his career and contribution to public life which has been forgotten by many modern-day commentators on the evolution of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="29"> Australia's immigration policy. It was Hubert Opperman who took the crucial ministerial stand in 1966 that led to the dismantling of the White Australia policy, and it will ever be part of his humane legacy and contribution to a united Australian community that that is one of the great things for which he will be remembered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert documented some of his remarkable life and career in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pedals, Politics and People</EMPHASIS> published in 1977. In his foreword to the book Sir Robert Menzies had this to say about his former minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hubert Opperman was, and is, a man of singular understanding and remarkable courage. During my term as Prime Minister, he was unquestionably one of my greatest assets.</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Hubert continued to lead an active life after his retirement. He was the Vice&hyphen;President of the Association for the Blind for 12 years and then continued to serve as an honorary counsellor. He was also an honorary member of the St Kilda Rotary Club.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1984 Sir Hubert was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. In 1991 he received one of France's highest awards, the Gold Medal of the City of Paris.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Oppy, as he has become known to us, holds a unique place in Australian history and in our hearts. He was a traditional Australian. He was a man of very strong personal faith. He was a person who gave a lot to his country in wartime and in peace. He was a very humble individual. He was a remarkably effective local member. The division of Corio was only ever held by the Liberal Party when Hubert Opperman was its member. After his retirement in 1967, it returned to the ranks of the Australian Labor Party and, despite successive assaults since, we have been unsuccessful in winning it back&mdash;and that is a tribute to his very effective work as a local member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us who joined in the thanksgiving for his remarkable life&mdash;when you live to the age of 92, despite the natural bereavement that the families feel, it is an occasion to celebrate a remarkable life&mdash;reflected on the great joy and great happiness he gave to many Australians. He was a great sportsman, a fine Australian, a proud member of the Liberal Party and a great member of that long period of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coalition rule under Prime Minister Menzies. He will be sadly missed by all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the Liberal Party and of the government, I extend to his wife Lady Mavys, his son, Ian, and to the Opperman family our most sincere sympathy in their loss. We salute the contribution that this remarkable Australian has made to the great history of our nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in expressing our sadness at this time on the death of such an outstanding Australian, Sir Hubert Opperman. As the Prime Minister has said today, Sir Hubert had a remarkable career&mdash;in the parliament, as a diplomat and as a champion Australian sportsman. He also saw service with the RAAF during the Second World War. His work for the Association of the Blind in Victoria is also well known and was very substantial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert, like so many former members, had a very humble upbringing, starting life as a telegram boy. His must have been the best delivered telegrams anywhere in the country at that time, given the speed with which he operated. It also obviously has something to do with longevity. My great uncle who started and stayed that way as a postman is going to turn 107 shortly. Clearly, if you get on your bike, you can stay on it for a very long time&mdash;and this gentleman is a living example of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert's achievements in sport have him compared to such other Australian champions as Don Bradman, Dawn Fraser and Walter Lindrom&mdash;and that is not bad company. That he held cycling records for more than 50 years is remarkable and testimony to his undoubted status as a great sporting hero. I note that he held the transcontinental Perth to Sydney cycling record for 32 years, taking just over 13 days to cycle that remarkable distance. Perhaps nobody had informed him that there was a train by then. Nevertheless, that effort stood as a record for a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert clearly had great stamina and phenomenal determination. Like so many Australian cyclists, he was very well known <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="30"> in Europe and the United Kingdom. In fact, a poll conducted by a Paris newspaper discovered that at one point in time he was the most popular sportsman in Europe. Until very late in life he continued to contribute substantially to Australian sport, particularly through his efforts to establish the Australian Sports Hall of Fame just over a decade ago. He made a very significant contribution to the parliament from his election to the seat of Corio in 1949, and particularly as the Minister for Immigration in the Menzies government. He also saw service as Government Whip and as the Minister for Shipping and Transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge, too, that Sir Hubert won an election in 1963 when he defeated Bob Hawke, who had nominated for the seat of Corio. That was probably one of the few defeats&mdash;and in terms of his subsequent career the most essential one&mdash;that Bob Hawke suffered. Had he not suffered that, perhaps his career would have been very different. So I guess we have reason to thank Oppy for his political skills, having put back by a decade or so the advent of our successful Prime Minister. On behalf of the federal opposition, I pass on to his wife and his son our sincere sympathy at this time, as we honour one of Australia's greatest champions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add to the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) by recounting this quote from the late Sir Hubert Opperman. He states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All I ask of you all is that whatever action you may contemplate in your political life the interests of Australia will always be regarded as paramount to your own.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that was the sort of guiding light that he brought to his representation as the member for Corio over all those years and to all of those other activities that he undertook through that busy life; that proud life which saw him win so much in France and around the world with his attributes, starting on a Malvern Star bicycle and moving up from there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a speech made on the supply bill on 11 May 1967, Sir Hubert said, `Perhaps one of the most progressive and appreciated steps <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taken while I held the immigration portfolio was the relaxation of the procedures relating to migration from Asia.' That is not an exact quote but a paraphrase of part of his speech. He was very proud of his work in commencing and initiating the abolition of the White Australia policy. He can rightly walk tall in regard to that contribution which he made to this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Winton Turnbull&mdash;a former member for Mallee who never missed a division over all the years that he was a member of this House and a whip for the then Country Party&mdash;led the adjournment debate just before Oppy headed off to become the Australian High Commissioner to Malta. Winton, who I gather had a great turn of phrase, for those who knew him all those years ago&mdash;and I know the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) would fall into that category&mdash;said to the House on that particular occasion, `The important thing is that the principles for which men stand will continue.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Corio&mdash;a seat held by Sir Hubert Opperman from 1949 to 1967&mdash;I am pleased to participate in the condolence motion now before the House. I cannot lay claim to knowing Sir Hubert Opperman well in a personal sense. It was through his sporting achievements that I came to learn of the great Oppy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was born and raised in the western district of Victoria in a small farming hamlet. Each year my father used to take us to see the Melbourne to Warrnambool bike race. I never saw Opperman ride in that race, because the last one that he rode in was 1946, which was before I was born, but in the excited discussions that always accompanied each bunch of riders as they swept through the town of Colac there was speculation about the location <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="31"> of the backmarkers and the scratch bunch. These discussions inevitably made reference to the great Oppy and the fact that those in the scratch bunch could never really hold a candle to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my early years the name Opperman or Oppy, as he was affectionately known, was raised in the same breath as the great Jack Dyer, who played for Richmond, Donald Bradman, Walter Lindrum and other greats in their respective sports. Hubert Opperman's life was lived in distinct phases. He was a great Australian sportsman, a politician and a diplomat. It should be remembered, however, that he was a successful businessman. He was a dedicated family man and was very dedicated to the Geelong community in the time that he served as the member for Corio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was his unique skill and stamina as a cyclist which wrote him into this country's history books of sport, created a local and international sporting hero and made Oppy a legend in his own day. Much will be spoken about his sporting achievements in this condolence motion, but there are two stories of achievements that I think are quite inspirational. The first occurred in 1928 with his win in the Bol d'Or in France. He pedalled 17 consecutive hours, and he came from 17 laps behind to set a record of 910 kilometres for the 24-hour race. The second occurred some 11 years later at the old Sydney velodrome, when in a 24-hour cycling marathon Opperman broke 101 state, Australian and national records for the distance. His feats of endurance literally boggled the ordinary sporting mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His political career began in 1949, when he first won the seat of Corio from Dedman, a minister in the Chifley Labor government. For this recent political history, I have borrowed on the great memory of another former member of Corio and former speaker of this House, the Hon. Gordon Scholes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opperman entered the House in 1949 after a near doubling of the size of the House of Representatives. Based on the 1946 figures, Corio was a Liberal seat but it still had to be won. Opperman did it by 235 votes. After the double dissolution in 1951, he held the seat by 139 votes. He went on to contest and win <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> successive campaigns until his retirement in 1967. He was a politician who could stay in the saddle or, as they say, stay on the bike. He was an astute campaigner politically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gordon Scholes recounts the story that, in his campaigns for the seat of Corio, Oppy would ride his bike home with the workers from Ford and other Geelong industries. Families with newborn babies received a note of congratulations from him. He is particularly remembered by many in Geelong for the personal note that they received from him when their loved ones had passed on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gordon Scholes relates the rather humorous tale of the 1966 campaign which, I think, was Gordon's first. The Labor Party organised a rather large cavalcade of cars to go through Geelong in protest against conscription and to support Gordon Scholes's campaign. The last car in the cavalcade contained Oppy waving to the assembled masses. That, of course, surprised the interested onlookers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that Hubert Opperman was a great Australian sporting hero. He is warmly remembered as a politician by many constituents in the seat of Corio. On behalf of those electors and, indeed, the people of Geelong&mdash;and I am sure that my old adversary, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), who represents the other side of the Barwon River in Geelong, will join me in this&mdash;I express a great sense of loss at his passing. We pass on to his surviving wife and family our deepest sympathy. We thank Sir Hubert Opperman for the great memories.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apart from the Clerk of the House, I guess I am the only remaining person here who served with Oppy. I actually served with him in the last Menzies cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Oppy was an enigmatic figure. Much has been said of him but I want to add a couple of stories. One thing that is of interest is that Oppy made his maiden speech on 22 February 1950 in the 19th Parliament of the Commonwealth. This is the 38th Parliament of the Commonwealth. It took 49 years for the first 19 parliaments, and it has taken from 1950 until now for the next 19 parliaments. It is interesting that it took a little longer for the first 19 sittings of our federation to occur.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="32">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of interest, too, how times have changed since 1950. When Oppy made his maiden speech, his sporting achievements&mdash;of which he was so proud and for which he is so often remembered&mdash;were almost 20 years behind him. The sad part about Oppy's life after politics was that he often said how strongly he was remembered for those incredible sporting achievements and how little people said about the 17 years that he spent in politics. He spent six years as a minister&mdash;three years in shipping and transport and three in immigration&mdash;and he made quite a remarkable contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a very humble and shy man. He was always prepared to make fun of himself. In the Menzies days the cabinet sometimes went rather late at night. I remember one night we were becoming a little weary and a few of us were having a bit of a snooze at the back. We were talking in the anteroom afterwards and Oppy said, `You know, it reminds me of the days when I was in those endurance races.' Bruce Small&mdash;whom many would know later as Sir Bruce Small, a man who made such an enormous contribution in the development of the canal infrastructure on the Gold Coast&mdash;</PARA>

Oppy said that he would be out pedalling furiously around the track and he would say to Bruce, `Look, can I have a break now?' Bruce would say, `No, keep going for a few more laps.' Oppy would say, `Can I have a break now?' Bruce would say, `No, just do a few more laps.' Finally, Oppy, being absolutely exhausted, would say, `I just have to stop for a while.' Bruce would say, `Okay, you can have 10 minutes.' Oppy would get off and lay his head down and five minutes later Bruce would wake him up and say, `You have been asleep for half an hour. Get going.' Poor old Oppy would get going, having had only that five&hyphen;minute break.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to be identified as well with this motion of condolence for Sir Hubert Opperman. I particularly want to speak because of the personal consideration which Oppy had shown to me. I appreciate the way in which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) detailed some of those quite remarkable elements of Sir Hubert Opperman's life. I also endorse the reference to Sir Hubert Opperman by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) as an outstanding man. He was indeed an outstanding man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the right honourable member for New England mentioned, Sir Hubert Opperman was often concerned that people remembered him more for his sporting prowess than for his political achievements. The Prime Minister has mentioned the contribution which Sir Hubert Opperman made to the end of the White Australia policy. That contribution deserves to be mentioned. Sir Hubert deserves to be remembered because his statement was instrumental in bringing about an end to the White Australia policy. It became known as the Opperman doctrine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So many quite incredible achievements of Sir Hubert Opperman have been detailed already. We have heard some of those remarkable anecdotes about his experience as a cyclist. For example, on one occasion his cycle was sabotaged by someone unknown. This person filed through the chain of Sir Hubert's cycle and it broke, but Oppy improvised in order to complete that particular race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At one time he held in excess of 100 separate records in cycling and numerous cycling classic titles. We should also remember that Sir Hubert and Lady Mavys enjoyed 69 years of their devoted marriage. He was as well known in Europe as he was in Australia. In fact, in 1991 he attended as a guest with Lady Mavys the centenary celebrations of the first Paris&hyphen;Brest race. On that occasion <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="33"> 100,000 Parisians turned out to honour Sir Hubert and Lady Opperman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert was very gracious to me. As Minister for Land Transport, I asked him to launch a bicycle strategy. If one were to get someone to launch such a strategy, then who better than Oppy. It was only about a month before an election was to be held and I am sure that it was of some concern to Sir Hubert that he had been asked to participate in an initiative by a government that was not of his political persuasion. That is why I say it was very gracious of him to accept. He was disappointed that some people expressed concern. But I made sure, as did those people working with me, that it was not a day for the government and it was not a day for me, but that it was a day for Oppy and he enjoyed it enormously&mdash;having the opportunity for the first time to launch a strategy which sought to address the problems of cyclists on the road, to ensure that their needs were incorporated in design work for roads and to do something about the estimated cost of $500 million of accidents involving cyclists on the roads. Among other things on that occasion, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I feel very much as though I am trading on past performances and longevity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But there is nothing which inspires me more than to be among cycling enthusiasts who are prepared to work for its betterment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having the Government focus on cycling as a means of transport and a means of health is a great inspiration.</PARA>
<PARA>Just a couple of years ago, in a kind message that he sent to me during the Christmas period, he referred to the fact that he and Lady Opperman were going to transfer from their unit to a two&hyphen;room apartment in a nearby hostel as they became increasingly aged and in need of greater attention. But, in referring to that change, he said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So we are walking a tightrope of uncertain time endeavouring to forecast and select, without sentiment but regard for the future, the memorabilia gathered over our 65 years of constant world journeys.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps without value but enshrined in our memories of other years, other incidents and other people!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, I wish to be associated with this condolence motion. Sir Hubert Opperman was an outstanding Australian who served his country with distinction as a sportsman of world class and standing, as a RAAF Flight Lieutenant, as a Liberal member of parliament and as a federal minister and diplomat. As was so properly recalled by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), he played a very significant role as Minister for Immigration between 1963 and 1966. It is those matters which I wish to highlight because he was a reformist in the great Liberal tradition. He pioneered liberalisation of the immigration program, yet was firm when he needed to be in that area, as all ministers are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As minister he presided over a review which changed the focus on conditions for the entry of non&hyphen;European people to Australia, their qualifications and ability to settle. Sir Hubert's action to address discrimination against non&hyphen;European students who were forced to leave Australia before becoming eligible for naturalisation, as it was then known, led to another Opperman doctrine. He put a stop to this practice by allowing non&hyphen;European temporary residents to become residents and citizens after just five years instead of what was formerly 15 years. This also allowed the residents and citizens to bring their families to Australia much earlier than might otherwise have been possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Opperman reforms are now recognised as heralding the beginning of the end of the White Australia program and paving the way for the reforms of the late 1960s and the 1970s. Emeritus Professor Jamie Mackie of the ANU  recently said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="34"> March 1996 in a tribute to the Opperman doctrine:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opperman deserves the nation's thanks . . . for having broken the political ice in 1966 and got the process of policy reform started, in substance if not yet in name.</PARA>
<PARA>These were very significant reforms for Australia. It is recognised that Sir Hubert started that process. He is a person whose inspiration and achievements were shared and celebrated by all Australians and whose contribution to public life was much wider than his legendary sporting fame. His political achievements alone will endure for all time as a major milestone in our multicultural history. I commend Sir Hubert Opperman and I offer my condolences and that of my department to his widow, Lady Mavys Opperman, his son, Ian, and family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and congratulations on your appointment. I rise to speak on this motion for two reasons. I think it is important that the families and friends of former politicians know that the efforts of someone such as Sir Hubert are respected on both sides of the House. In my case, there are two reasons, one being that Mrs Annie O'Keefe, who was at the centre of the High Court case in the late 1940s which, I guess, broke open the infamous White Australia policy, was from our family. I have always held in high regard the efforts of Sir Hubert as a minister in that policy area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also had the privilege to meet him and Lady Mavys at an event that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) will take some pride in. Only two or three years ago, I had the privilege of representing the then federal Labor government at the launch of the new Sprinter trains in Melbourne. Much of the credit for the trains, by the way, was being claimed by the then newly elected Liberal state government in Victoria, but it was the member for Charlton who, as the Labor land transport minister, signed the cheque for them. The first such Sprinter train was named after Sir Hubert, just as all of them have been named after various sporting personalities. He joined us at the launch and we took the train trip to Bendigo with him and Lady Mavys.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell just one little tale about the day. He told a joke to the assembled media and throng which, let me say, was a joke from another era. We would probably describe it now as not politically correct. Alan Brown and I muttered to each other that we would not have been able to get away with that one, but a very kindly media did not report it and it was left aside. I think it was a measure of the regard in which he was held by all Australians that that was the way that situation transpired.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to express my condolences to the family and many friends of Sir Hubert Opperman, without doubt one of this nation's sporting heroes. I did not know Sir Hubert personally, although his feats as a cyclist are legendary, not only in Australia but around the world. His personal qualities are even more fondly remembered by those who had the pleasure of meeting him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert Opperman was born in 1904 in Rochester, Victoria, with cycling in his blood. His father, a butcher, was an amateur cycling champion. In those days of amateur cycling, prizes of $1 were usually offered to the winners, and Sir Hubert later said that he regarded them `with more relish than Jack Dempsey did a million dollar purse'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert turned professional in 1922, leaving his job at the navigation department when he was refused leave of absence to compete in a race. Actually, the event in question was of particular interest to me because it was the Launceston to Hobart road race and his first win as a professional. In fact, Sir Hubert returned to Launceston in 1987 to open the National Masters Games and rode a lap of honour of the velodrome at the age of 83.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="35"> Sir Hubert's professional cycling career was given a boost after he took a job in a small cycle shop in the Melbourne suburb of Mal vern. The cycling&hyphen;mad owner of the shop was Bruce Small, later Sir Bruce Small, who was to manage Sir Hubert throughout his professional career and also developed the famous Malvern Star bicycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After winning the Launceston&hyphen;Hobart race for a third successive time, Sir Hubert took the coveted Warrnambool to Melbourne event in 1924 to become the Australian road champion. The same year he won the gruelling Goulburn to Sydney race with its tough climb over the Razorback, despite suffering two punctures and a painful fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next few years, his achievements captured the imagination of the population, so much so that 30,000 people were on hand to see him defeat the American star, Frank Corry, in Melbourne. In 1927 Sir Hubert set a world record for the distance covered in 24 hours. In 1928 Sir Hubert set off for Europe with Bruce Small, taking with them the qualities of mateship, courage and a fair go which had epitomised the Australian troops who had served there in World War I.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After surprising the French by finishing 17th in the Tour de France without the support enjoyed by the European teams, Sir Hubert competed in an event which was to forge his name in cycling glory. It was known as the Bol d'Or, a continuous 24&hyphen;hour race around a 500&hyphen;metre velodrome. His achievements had so worried some of his rivals that they sabotaged his two bicycles by filing halfway through the chains, which both broke in the first hour of the race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Showing the crowd some true Australian spirit and initiative, Bruce Small found an old roadster complete with mudguards, lamps and upturned handlebars for Sir Hubert to continue on while repairs were made to his racing machines. By the time he got back on his bike, Sir Hubert was some 17 laps behind the field, but at the 12&hyphen;hour halfway mark he was in front and, to cries of `Come on, Oppy' from the crowd, he pushed on to set a world record for 24&hyphen;hour cycling, breaking a further seven records along the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, Bruce Small was not satisfied and urged him on to set yet another record for 1,000 kilometres. Oppy is said to have replied, `Blast the record; all I want to do is get <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> off the bike,' but by then the crowd realised what was happening and resumed its chant, spurring him on for another 79 minutes and another world record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The performance was so impressive that in a poll of more than 1&half; million people conducted by a Paris newspaper Sir Hubert was voted the most popular sportsman in Europe. The press decided that the reasons for this were his courage, loyalty and perfect smile. There was, of course, no question as to his loyalty and courage but what the French did not realise was that his perpetual smile stemmed from the fact that at the time he did not understand a word they spoke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On his return to Australia, Oppy continued on his recording breaking spree, including the phenomenal achievement in 1932 of cycling some 1,380 kilometres in 24 hours&mdash;a record which still stands today. In fact, that record stands as one of the three greatest single performances by Australian sportsmen, along with Sir Donald Bradman's 309 test runs in a day and Herb Elliott's 1,500 metre victory at the 1960 Rome Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through this part of his career, Sir Hubert was one of a handful of Australian sporting heroes to lift the spirit of the nation during the Great Depression. Along with Sir Donald Bradman, Walter Lindrum and Phar Lap, Sir Hubert gave Australians suffering through those hard times something to cheer about. There was certainly plenty of cheering in 1932 when he was the first person to ride a bicycle across the newly opened Sydney Harbour Bridge. Amazingly, Oppy was also the first person to ride a bicycle through the Sydney Harbour Tunnel after it was opened in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Hubert's racing career ended with the outbreak of World War II, in which he served as a Flight Lieutenant in the RAAF. Personifying the adage that `old cyclists never die, they just change gears', Sir Hubert turned his many abilities to the political arena in 1949, winning the Victorian seat of Corio. His political career carried numerous highlights, including positions as Government Whip, Minister for Shipping and Transport and Minister for Immigration.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="36">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He later went on to become Australia's High Commissioner to Malta. In his maiden speech to parliament, Sir Hubert said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know that just as the juvenile admires the champion, walks like him, acts like him and follows his example, so we in our malleable condition will be fashioned by the example set us by the older members of this House.</PARA>
<PARA>If today's aspiring athletes can take on board just a sample of Sir Hubert's qualities, this country's sporting heritage is certainly assured. As a nation we are undoubtedly poorer for the passing of Sir Hubert Opperman. Like all of my colleagues, I extend my condolences to his family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in support of this condolence motion for Sir Hubert Opperman. I came to know Oppy during the last seven years of his life. He was one of my constituents. He lived in Salford Park Retirement Village, which is in the centre of my electorate. As I got to know him over those years the full measure of the man gradually became apparent, but not from him because he was a very modest man. It was others who had to tell the stories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) alluded to earlier, for those of us who attended the memorial service in Melbourne last week the full sweep of his life, that incredible life, such as him being a sportsman, all his records and the time he held those records, was gradually revealed in the eulogies. What grabs me, and indeed so many people, when you look back at those years is that he rode pretty antiquated equipment compared with what we ride today. They did not have the gear then that we have today. It was really old, heavy gear. When he went to Europe he did not have the latest gear that all the Europeans had. He was riding very backward equipment by comparison but he still won all those races and set all those records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He served in the air force and did his duty to his country. We have heard in some detail about his record as a parliamentarian and as a minister&mdash;defeating a minister to win the seat that had never been a Liberal seat; defeating Bob Hawke and holding on to it for all of those years; an immigration policy that was enlightened before its time; a successful <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> diplomat; and a friend and servant of the blind, amongst many others. That was perhaps particularly appropriate living in the seat of Aston, which is named after Tilly Aston, who was the founder of the braille library of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go into all the details that have been covered by many of the previous speakers. I will mention some of my personal experiences. I knew Oppy during the last seven years of his life. I first met him in 1989 when I was the candidate for Aston and aspiring to defeat the incumbent Labor member. I went along to Salford Park to address 200 or 300 residents at a meeting&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was addressing the 200 or 300 residents of Salford Park and thought I was going fairly well until a somewhat senior looking gentleman stood up at the back and gave me a fairly thorough work&hyphen;out during question time. After it was all over, and having survived this fairly rigorous work&hyphen;out from this very knowledgeable and intelligent gentleman at the back, I inquired of the management who the person was. It turned out to be Oppy. I said to somebody, `I thought he was supposed to be on my side.' That did not stop him giving me a good work&hyphen;out. Having done that, I went up and introduced myself and that is when I got to know him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Oppy not only appeared with his wife, Lady Mavys, in some of my publicity brochures, but also sent me `Oppygrams' on a regular basis. For those who do not know, he was well known for his `Oppygrams' which were little pieces of paper usually of a pro forma nature but handwritten. During the subsequent campaigns and other campaigns these would arrive at regular intervals. They would give me encouragement, tell me what I had done wrong or tell me what to do differently. Even the odd donation came along as well. He was as delighted as we all were when we subsequently won the next election. I have met him on a number of occasions since then.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="37">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming thing about Oppy was that, in spite of fame and the power and trappings of office and his achievements, he was a man of outstanding humility. He was a man of humanitarian values. He always considered others before himself. I think another of the outstanding features of his life that he would wish to have remembered was the constant support, wherever he went, of his wife, Lady Mavys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was one of life's true gentlemen. He died on his exercise bike, with the cycle clips still around his legs and the famous beret on one side.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to be associated with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and other members of this House in the condolence motion for Sir Hubert Opperman. As other members have said, he died in his 92nd year still riding his bike&mdash;a remarkable achievement in itself. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that when Oppy became a member in 1949 it was the beginning of the long 23 years of Menzies government. There was great excitement in Geelong, I well recall&mdash;I was a young boy&mdash;when Oppy beat J.J. Dedman by 235 votes, a very narrow margin. All of us who had some interest in politics were very excited that the Menzies government had been swept to power and that this famous cyclist was now our local member, though by a very narrow margin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting aspect of that election was that Oppy beat a minister in the Chifley government, the Hon. J.J. Dedman, who was quite famous for cutting the tails off shirts as a wartime measure. That was the highlight of the campaign&mdash;and the member for Corio should draw Mr Scholes's attention to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Oppy was always a very strong member, being a holder of a marginal seat. As a young <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> man, I had a number of conversations with him about how you hold a marginal seat as a minister of the Crown. He always returned home on Saturday mornings to talk to constituents. He said to me, `You must always have a feel for what they are saying here in Geelong because, if you don't attend here on a regular basis, you won't have the seat the next time around.' That aspiring politician from Western Australia, Bob Hawke, came over in 1963, I think, to give it a run. Oppy dealt with him in a strong fashion. It took a long while for that young Bob Hawke to return to the political fray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other members have made strong reference to Oppy's prowess as a cyclist. All of us in the Geelong region and in Victoria know Oppy to be a true hero in terms of those remarkable performances in France and Europe and, as the member for Corio said, in that famous Warrnambool to Melbourne bike race where Oppy dominated in terms of fastest time. I do not think he won it but three times he was the fastest time holder. That, in terms of cycling, is a very high honour, apart from his international reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As other members have said, he was a very human local member. As a young man, I had a number of conversations with him about politics, the way he saw the Australian parliament and how he saw the handling of a very marginal seat. He was a great Australian in the tradition of all those sportsmen mentioned. This House is indeed honoured to have a person of that calibre as a minister. He was an international sportsman and a wonderful human being. I join with others in this condolence motion and pass on my sympathies to Lady Mavys Opperman and her son. I also convey the condolences of former member Tony Street. I know he was very close to Sir Hubert. The electorates of Corio and Corangamite are the Geelong electorates and there has been a long association over many years.

Michael (Mick) Jerome Young, AO, Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Port Adelaide, South Australia, from 1974 to 1988;  Special Minister of State in 1983 and from 1984 to 1987;  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in 1987; Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Multicultural Affairs from 1987 to 1988; Leader of the House in 1983 and from 1984 to 1988; and Vice&hyphen;President of the Executive Council in 1983 and from 1987 to 1988, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased to acknowledge the presence in the public gallery of Mary Young and Mick's daughter and son, and other members of his family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As somebody who entered parliament as a political opponent of Mick Young's, and on the same day, I want to say a few words about him. We were both elected to the parliament midway through the three&hyphen;year period of the Whitlam era&mdash;on 18 May 1974. Mick Young and I, over the time that both of us were in parliament, said some very vigorous and, on occasions, quite insulting things about each other. He would not retrospectively, in any sense, thank me for engaging in any humbug or for denying that that happened. We were vigorous opponents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a great debater; he was a very humorous man; he had a capacity to deliver political ridicule in a fashion I do not think I have encountered in its blunt form from anybody else in the time I have been in the parliament. He did have what was characteristically often described&mdash;whether accurately or not&mdash;as that earthy, Irish&hyphen;Australian wit. He did it very well, he did it with style and he did it very effectively for his party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that Mick Young was a very distinguished son of the Australian Labor Party. It is appropriate on occasions like this that the lengthier, more personal eulogies be delivered by the party colleagues of the person who is being remembered. But it is also appropriate to acknowledge the tradition of your political opponents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick Young came right out of the centre of the Labor Party's working&hyphen;class tradition. He <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> did reflect, when he came to parliament, that it had been a long journey from the shearing shed to the House of Representatives. He typified the Irish&hyphen;Catholic tradition of the Australian Labor Party, a tradition that, I note, is now perhaps not quite as powerful as it once was. As I listened to some of the names being read out today, I began to imagine that the Irish&hyphen;Catholic tradition is at least in part being transplanted to the Liberal Party of Australia and to the National Party of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On occasions like this, one ought to reflect upon the traditions that have made up the two great sides of Australian politics. I have no doubt, as a student of politics, that Mick Young has been one of the most significant figures of the past generation in the Australian labour movement. There is little doubt that the Labor Party would not have won in 1972 without Mick Young's organising skills. As somebody who, in the concluding months of the coalition's reign in office in 1972, was aware of the seeming inevitability that change was going to occur, I respected Mick Young's organising ability. There is no doubt that without him, as Gough Whitlam has acknowledged, the Labor Party would not have come to power in 1972.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick Young understood the need for strong party organisations. He understood the need to change the nature of the Labor Party in Victoria. He had a capacity to work very effectively with his federal parliamentary leader. He was, as I recall, the first national secretary of the Australian Labor Party. As somebody who has, on occasions, witnessed the vagaries of federalism inside my own party, I can understand that it took quite an effort to bring about the establishment of a federal Labor Party secretariat under Mick Young.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the government, I say to Mick's family and to all his friends in the Labor Party that he has made a very significant mark on the political life of this country over the last 20 or 30 years. He was a likeable, robust and direct character. He had great passions. He had a great passion for his party. He had a great passion for the Port Adelaide football team. He had a great passion for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="39"> union that he represented and from which he came.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick Young was a devoted member of a tight-knit family. He brought to public life a tradition which many of us look upon with respect&mdash;even though we may not always agree with its expression. I certainly respected him as a tough opponent. He dished a lot out to me. I dished some back. Neither of us ever apologised, and that is the nature of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On an occasion such as this I would like to record my sympathy to Mary and to Mick's two children. I was privileged to attend the memorial requiem at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney. It was a marvellous tribute. Many moving speeches were delivered, not least the speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). It was a cavalcade of Labor Party tradition and history over the past 20 or 30 years. Mary, to you and your children and to others in the chamber and in the gallery who knew Mick best and were associated with him over many years, I extend the sympathy of my government and of my party and express our respects for the contribution he made to the cause in which he so passionately believed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of anticipatory apology I must say that, quite properly, this condolence motion will go on for some time as there are many people, particularly on the Labor Party side of the House, who will want to pay their respects to Mick. However, I have a commitment to some guests. I hope that none of those opposite and none of Mick's family will regard it as in any way disrespectful of me if I am not personally present when the debate concludes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia and of the government, I extend our sympathy to Mick's family and I record my respect for the contribution he made to the robust political tradition which he so effectively espoused over such a long period of time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for his remarks and for the spirit in which he delivered them. I am sure his views will be appreciated by all who knew and loved Mick on this side of the House and much further afield. It is an indica <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tion of the man that so many people in this chamber&mdash;as is the case with the Prime Minister himself&mdash;can recount the fact that Mick Young was known as a colleague. That we have his young family in the gallery with us here today is an indication of how untimely Mick's death was and, in these circumstances, how fresh in the minds of so many of us is the memory of our dear friend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gough Whitlam once said of Mick that he was one of the greatest pieces of good fortune the Labor Party has ever had. That is an extraordinarily heartfelt judgment from one of the greatest leaders the Labor Party of Australia has ever had. Gough Whitlam formed that judgment for many reasons. Partly, that judgment was formed out of pure gratitude. Mick Young was, I believe, one of the half-dozen creators of the modern Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was Gough Whitlam who was the beneficiary, in political terms, of Mick's extraordinary political skills when the Labor Party was restructured in the early 1970s. Subsequently, as National Secretary of the Labor Party, Mick ran what was probably the first of the truly modern election campaigns&mdash;the Labor Party's `It's time' campaign of 1972. That campaign was devised, basically, by Mick Young and was largely funded by his fundraising activities. It was the first time that that office had devoted itself seriously to substantial fundraising. Both the strategy and the resources were, in large measure, the product of Mick Young's activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick himself believed that at that period in his life he made his greatest contribution to public life. I am not so sure that that was the case. I think his subsequent contribution to public life was equally considerable in our period of opposition during the 1970s&mdash;a situation that was not dissimilar from that which we confront now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the fight of people like Mick Young and Paul Keating that kept the courage in the ranks, that kept the party ticking over. Mick was a tremendous believer in intellectual endeavour in the party&mdash;not just a good parliamentary performance but getting the policy right and getting the electorate accustomed to the way in which you think and accustomed to the solutions that you propose <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="40"> for national problems. Therefore, he was always prominent at the conferences, always there keeping the party on track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was finally recognised&mdash;and I do not think I had ever seen Mick prouder in all his many achievements&mdash;by the party when we made him president in 1986. He said on that occasion, `I think that the greatest lesson is that you can do it from the shearing shed.' When I read that quote of Mick's I went back to his maiden speech. His maiden speech is actually a wonderful detailing of his personal origins. Halfway through it is a plea for the people that he left behind in the shearing shed. He went through in great detail the fact that shearers then still had not achieved&mdash;and they probably still do not have&mdash;what we would regard as normal opportunities in life. He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Few former shearers escape the scourges of back injuries and other severe muscular and rheumatic ailments. For all of these reasons, I put the argument strongly to this House for a better deal for the members of my old trade&mdash;an honourable and colourful profession which has made a tremendous contribution to Australian economic and social life.</PARA>
<PARA>It is an honourable and colourful profession producing honourable and colourful people&mdash;one of whom was Mick Young. All of us here remember him for his humour because we could get it on a daily basis. He was not ungenerous with his humour. I recollect that whenever I had a decent conversation with my wife on calling home and I regaled the list of jokes I wanted left in my mind she would automatically say, `You've had lunch with Mick again.' It was either lunch or a telephone conversation. I guess I spoke to Mick almost every day I was in Canberra during the last five years. If it was not every day, it was two or three times a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick was generous with his advice, but he was quiet with his advice. Many people have left politics and have never left the stage. Mick left politics, left the stage and stayed in the game. He stayed in the game supporting us&mdash;supporting us in relevant terms by providing us with funds, with resources, with advice, with sage counsel&mdash;even after he felt he could no longer make a contribution in parliament. Right to the very end he was doing that both with me and with other <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> colleagues who came to see him when he was in hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His humour was always pungent but never ultimately wounding and always, apart from the sorts of occasions I have referred to, to the point. There is a wonderful quote from the time when he was in the process of restructuring the Labor Party and he overheard a plot in the corner&mdash;perhaps a means by which the other agents of that change might be got at. It was actually referring to Clyde Cameron, an old AWU mate of his. He shouted out to them, `Go ahead and take him on. You'll need only four things: a bottle of No&hyphen;Doz tablets, a Trent memory training course, a barrel load of bayonets and a lot more brains than any of you blokes have got.' So it was not turned on just you, Mr Prime Minister, from time to time&mdash;it could be turned in any particular direction at any particular time&mdash;and it was always extremely effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember one of the first occasions when I came into this chamber. Malcolm Fraser was then Prime Minister. Malcolm carried into the chamber heavy artillery but not terribly mobile artillery. That was once said of Winston Churchill, and it absolutely applied to Malcolm Fraser. So he was very good at portentousness but not necessarily aware of perhaps the consequences or how he might be got at. There was one fella who was always likely to get him, and that was Mick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Malcolm was announcing some committee to solve some problem that will probably recur 20 years from now and it probably occurred 20 years before that. He was reading out a list of names of people who would do that for him. The House had gone into its usual torpor in those circumstances as we listened to the portentous message come across. There was silence at the end of Malcolm's contribution, and then all of a sudden a voice was heard from our benches: `Not one of them is a Catholic.' Perhaps things have changed on your side of the House. If what you, Prime Minister, say about Irish Catholics is true on your side of the House, they have got us all.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not. If they bring to you the sense of humour that they bring to us, that is an advantage for you as well. Mick was a considerable parliamentarian. As Leader of the House, he made some substantial changes. The Electoral Act that we have renders, or helps to render, our national politics in difficult times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we recollect that it costs about $20,000 for a 60-second spot on national television at peak hour, Mick's Electoral Act changes rendered national politics about as corruption free as you can get national politics. His declaration propositions, his public funding propositions&mdash;all of them were critical to getting in place for our national politics the means of evading the sorts of things that have happened elsewhere and to some extent in state politics over the last few years. We owe a lot to Mick Young for helping to get, and substantially getting, that act in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is often forgotten, for a very considerable period we in this chamber had no committee system beyond the sort of functional machinery type committees. We did not have policy committees or committees which shadowed ministries, apart from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which we formed with the Senate. It was Mick Young who got those in place. That was really almost the last thing that he did as Leader of the House. He was a very hard Leader of the House. He was very hard on his political opponents, but he also had an appreciation of the capacity of the chamber and individual members of it to contribute to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So he deserves a memory not just for his contribution in machinery terms to the Labor Party but also for his life as a parliamentarian. That goes to his ministries as well&mdash;as Special Minister of State more broadly and as Minister for Immigration, where he persisted with what has been a bipartisan policy in the direction of multiculturalism for the period that he held that office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to understand Mick Young you had to see him at home in the Port. He had all the people known by nicknames, not by surnames, Christian names or given names. You <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were dealing with Possum, Philpy, Tuppence, the Penguin and Puff. You were basically dealing with rhyming slang for a description of any particular type of activity that you cared to choose and it took you at least two or three years and sufficient humility to ask for translations to really understand what was going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister referred to Mick's association with the Port Adelaide football team, but there was also soccer and other sports which are assumed to be minority sports but are in fact internationally majority sports that Mick was associated with. He was associated with them largely because of that sense of inclusiveness that he had and the fact that he was anxious that Australia's new communities after World War II that played such an important role in the life of the Port should also have their sporting endeavours and activities properly recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So he was really at home when he was in Port Adelaide and from where he took his tolerance in politics. Tolerance is not necessarily within all streams of opinion in the Labor Party and in all regions of the Labor Party. This is a hard political party and it plays its politics hard&mdash;internally as well as externally. The one part where that is less so is in South Australia. So Mick Young's politics were probably more of a generous nature and of a generous outlook on life than they were just about anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also had a tremendous belief in what could be done at a local level, in the power of education and in the capacity for a person to be able to hook themselves up the ladder as a result of their getting a chance in life with education. He also recognised that the formal systems would not necessarily always produce that. Therefore one of the things he was very proud of as a local member was a scholarship scheme that he helped to fund and to put in place. He used fundraising endeavours. Whenever there was a fundraiser for it, he would bring in the people who had been beneficiaries of the scholarship to offer testimony for what they were able to achieve as a result of having been those beneficiaries. That scholarship lasted for a very long time <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="42"> and I understand that it is going to be revived soon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick loved his family. What a wonderful occasion it was, as a family occasion during that terrible trauma of his long and lingering decline, to have that family around him&mdash;to go to St Vincent's Hospital and to have the whole floor taken over by Youngs and associates. This was so much so&mdash;fortunately there are a number of wards there&mdash;that the six brothers could sleep in relays and be joined by the children and friends for a very lengthy period. It was like an ongoing public meeting. It was a wake that started very early indeed, and in which Mick was an active participant for a very considerable period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nurses loved him. I remember one of them coming in and saying, `Now, dear, how do you feel?' `Not very well,' was his response in his last two days of life. He had a name and a comment for everybody who came in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was enormously proud of his family and he was proud when it was joined by a grandchild, Isabella, in his last six months of life. Isabella arrived just before Christmas, at the same time as news of his illness, and he was so proud that she was there. I hope she will be introduced to the remarks that are made here today, because she was much loved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very deepest sympathy of our parliament goes to Mary, the kids and grandchildren. You had a wonderful husband and father. You know that, we all know that and we all gratefully share in his memory.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Shearing sheds have better rules than this parliament,' and with that enjoiner Mick Young launched into another bout of activity. On that occasion it was with the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). All of those who were here when Mick Young was in full force witnessed those sharp enjoiners that he launched often when least expected, but quite often to a dorothy dixer. What I could never work out was whether Mick in fact practised or whether it all came naturally. I suspect it was the latter, not the former, and I certainly salute that colourful aspect of his contribution to the parliament and to the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it would be foolish to stop at that, because there was a very deep thinking side to Mick Young and as a minister he made a very meaningful contribution to the Labor Party. Whilst I was a political opposite to him, I noted one aspect of that contribution which I will try to exemplify in the role as Deputy Prime Minister and as we set out as a new government. That aspect was the ability of Mick Young to provide cohesion, network and contact through the vertical and horizontal length and depth of the Labor Party and, through his role as a minister, beyond that through government to the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was in that sense not always in the public eye. But, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) have indicated, he was a truly great communicator. Through that communication effort and capability he provided a great deal of cohesion at times when there was a lot of pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it was a pleasure and a great privilege to attend St Mary's. It was a pleasure to know Mick Young. It was a great privilege to attend St Mary's on that day a couple of Fridays ago in Sydney and to see the almost tribal occasion&mdash;if I can say that in a meaningful way&mdash;that that service represented, with so many people from so many walks of life who communicated with Mick Young and who were touched by Mick Young in one way or the other present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A happier occasion was last year at a Sydney Swans match. Mick Young was there in great form enjoying his football&mdash;as he so often did&mdash;making a few quips on the side about the game and giving political predictions, one of which has come true. His company on those occasions was always very stimulating and it was a great privilege to have been able to enjoy that company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the National Party, I extend our sympathy to his wife, Mary, to the family and particularly to all the brothers who turned up&mdash;so many of them. They all look like a chip off the old block and they were there to salute and farewell their brother whom they held so dearly. Mick Young's contribution, in the cohesiveness and communication he provided, should be a lesson to all of us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Mick Young had been in this chamber today I know exactly what he would have said to me as I walked into this House for the first time this morning: `Welcome to the A-grade, comrade.' Mick was not a Senate man. In fact, I cannot think of anyone else who was quite so comprehensively and consistently disdainful of the Senate as Mick&mdash;except perhaps me, but that is another story. Others&mdash;like the sadly-no&hyphen;longer&hyphen;with&hyphen;us member for Blaxland&mdash;had their rhetorical moments, but Mick was absolutely, relentlessly consistent. `Seventy-six bodies on a slab,' he would call us over there. `Proof of life after death.' Above all, of course, `The B&hyphen;grade.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What really got Mick's goat about the Senate says a lot about Mick himself. He just did not see it as a house of the people. For Mick, politics was absolutely above all else about people: people's wants, people's needs, how they should be represented. He was of course absolutely right about the Senate. However senators choose to rationalise their existence, the truth of the matter is that when you represent everybody in a state you do not in practice represent anybody. So Mick was a quintessential House of Representatives man as the people of Port Adelaide, as has been said, knew to their enormous advantage for so many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To imagine Mick not surrounded by people is to contemplate a duck without a pond or a fish in a desert. He was just a people man. He was marvellous, as we all know, with people. He could share a beer, a laugh or an idea with absolutely anyone, and he did. I mention all three of those things advisedly because, as I remember Mick&mdash;at least until he went off the grog because of his illness a few years ago&mdash;those things usually went together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was not just a great drinking companion, although he certainly was that in the finest Irish, shearing shed, trade union and at least pre-yuppie ALP tradition. He was not just&mdash;although he certainly was that&mdash;one of the most infectiously, engagingly funny people any of us has ever known, with that marvellous capacity to trot out an old story or an old line which we had all heard 20 times before <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but to do it with that great rollicking, infectious belly laugh that made us all seem as though we were hearing it for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was also an ideas man. He was captivated and absorbed by ideas. He read widely, cared deeply and thought long and hard about how to make the world a better place, particularly for ordinary, decent, hardworking people who wanted a better world, a better country, for themselves and their kids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who thinks of Mick as just a likeable, knock-about, jokey kind of a character and no more than that absolutely misses the point. He was a crucial figure in the history of the modern Labor Party and, as such, of modern Australian society. He was someone who had thought long and hard about the problems of Australian society and about what the ALP in particular had to become if it was going to be able effectively to address them. He was someone who had that capacity to straddle the past and the future, building all the bridges that mattered along the way between the industrial and political wings of the Labor movement, between the different factions, between the idealists and the pragmatists and between the ALP and the broader Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick Young was, with Clyde Cameron, the absolutely crucial figure in the 1970 intervention in the Victorian state branch of the ALP, without which the Whitlam government could never have been elected. He was the crucial figure, as again has been said, as national secretary of the party in devising and implementing the `It's time' campaign of 1972. He was, around about the same time, a key player, it needs to be remembered, in opening our eyes about China and creating the conditions for one of the most significant of the early Whitlam government innovations, the foundations really of our modern engagement with Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a key figure&mdash;many of us have now forgotten, but let's remember it&mdash;in developing new thinking about job creation in Australia with his book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I Want to Work</EMPHASIS>. He was a brilliant parliamentary performer and Leader of the House, as has been said, and he was a serious and thoughtful contributor to cabinet deliberations&mdash;contributing judgment, balance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="44"> and practical experience across a whole range of issues that simply would not have been nearly as well handled as they were without his involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I knew Mick Young well for a long time. I was nowhere near being his closest friend or his closest political friend, but we did have some heady times together, not least during that awful period in the early years of the Hawke government when, at a personal and ministerial level, nothing much seemed to go right for Mick. The frustrations accumulated to the point where he made the decision to leave politics. I could understand his decision at the time, but I thought then, and now, that it was a premature one and a tragedy for the Labor Party and the labour movement that he made it. Inevitably, it took him a very long time to get over it, as it took us a very long time to get over his departure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Mick always bounced back. He was certainly in the last few years beginning to enjoy the fruits of a very successful business consultancy which brought together all his marvellous skills and qualities and, in particular, his superb human qualities. He seemed to have beaten off a whole series of debilitating illnesses over the last couple of years and be ready to begin life all over again when suddenly there occurred this last illness which took him from us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add my tribute to Mick's memory for several reasons. The first is that I spent so many years, on either side of the bar of the chamber, on exactly the opposite side to him, with views which on most occasions were quite contrary to his own. As the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) said a while ago, on one occasion Mick spoke about the rules of this place being half as good as those of the woolshed. It was in response to some measure I had taken in the House. I remember, when we switched sides and he was Leader of the House, every time I tried, as Manager of Opposition Business, to take action against him, he would quote back to me a speech I had made on an earlier occasion, and I was absolutely lost. There was no way I could deny the validity of his argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick was a very redoubtable political opponent, a very significant performer for the Labor Party. As has been said by each of those who have spoken, his performance in the organisation might well have been more significant for the Labor Party than his contribution here in the parliament. There is no doubt that prior to 1972, after successive attempts, the Labor Party really had failed to get its act together until Mick became its national secretary. He was an extraordinary worker within the Labor organisation. Certainly, in his hands, with Gough Whitlam at its helm, the victory of the `It's time' campaign is now very much a fact of history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the parliament, his quick wit, his inevitable humour and his delightful way of being able to make you laugh at yourself were attributes that were extraordinarily hard to combat. I know of no other parliamentary performer who was as adept at doing that. He was quite extraordinary in the way in which, when the heat was on the Labor Party, whether in government or in opposition, by a turn of phrase, by quoting an individual's words back at himself or herself, he was able to turn the tide completely. No matter how critical the issue, it finally would fade, simply because of the way in which Mick was able to turn the phrase and turn the occasion.</PARA>

While in adversarial politics we make few real friends, Mick's memory is one that I will always respect. To his widow, to his family and to his extended family, including that magnificent brotherhood that we saw at the requiem mass, I would like to say how deeply I felt for them in his premature departure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mick Young was one of the great Labor characters and, as has been said, one of the architects of the modern Labor Party. He played a central role with Gough Whitlam in reinventing the Labor Party and making it ready for government in 1972. He became Secretary of the South Australian branch of the ALP in 1968 and held that position until 1974. Even more important, in 1969, he had the guts to challenge the redoubtable Joe Chamberlain and defeated him narrowly to become Federal Secretary of the ALP. He doubled up as federal and state secretary until 1973, as was the practice at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In February 1970, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) pointed out, the federal executive resolved to intervene in the affairs of the Victorian branch of the ALP, sack the then central executive and appoint Mick Young as administrator of the Victorian branch. There was a good newspaper account of Mick Young's achievements on his death but, oddly, not one referred to what I think was his greatest achievement&mdash;his work in 1970 as federal secretary, South Australian state secretary and de facto secretary in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Federal intervention took place because the Victorian branch was virtually on a war footing with Gough Whitlam as the federal parliamentary leader and, indeed, with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) who was then state leader. In 1969, while Labor retained two traditional seats which had been lost in the 1966 debacle&mdash;Batman and Lalor&mdash;and won back Maribyrnong due to boundary changes, it failed to win any of the marginal seats needed for victory. If Gough Whitlam had picked up <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Victorian seats in the same proportion that he won them in the other mainland states, he would have become Prime Minister in 1969.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick felt extraordinarily isolated in that year in Melbourne. There he was in a city he did not know very well. As his son pointed out to me last night, he did not even know where the restaurants were, he did not even know where the good pubs were, he was not even quite sure where to stay. There was a very real risk that the knives would be out, metaphorically at least, and perhaps worse than that. Despite his isolation, through sheer force of personality, good humour and persistence, he took control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With threats of a split and the possibility of the creation of a breakaway industrial Labor Party in Victoria, the situation required coolness, judgment, nerve and persuasiveness&mdash;and Mick Young had all four qualities. The Victorian branch was completely reconstructed and remained united, open and inclusive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1972 Victoria played a vital role in securing Whitlam's election and won even more seats in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick was the national campaign director in 1972 and devised the `It's time' theme. He had the rare gift of humour, a great capacity for analysis and the unusual skill of finding ways of effecting an honourable compromise between conflicting points of view without sacrificing principle. He was also National President of the ALP between 1986 and 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gough Whitlam asked me to pass on one of his favourite stories about Mick Young. On Easter Monday in 1973 Pope Paul VI was presenting medals. Mr and Mrs Whitlam received gold medals, another couple received silver medals and the police&mdash;the polizia&mdash;were to receive bronze medals. Anyway, as it happened, the polizia's places were taken by Eric Walsh, Mick's great mate, and Mick Young himself who impersonated the polizia&mdash;one hopes they were plain&hyphen;clothes polizia&mdash;so that they could get the medals from the Pope for their mothers. Entirely appropriate, I would have thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick brought together the Irish Catholic tradition and a strong commitment to radical reform. I noticed with some interest that there <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="46"> is a new Liberal member with the first names of Joseph Benedict&mdash;and that suggests a certain dissonance with their political history and a certain assonance with ours. But Mick had that Irish Catholic tradition and a strong commitment to radical reform on issues such as welfare, employment, Aboriginal and migrant affairs, foreign affairs and electoral reform. He was the architect of our present electoral system: one vote, one value; independent redistribution of electoral boundaries; public funding of elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not repeat what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) said about Mick's enormous contribution on China policy. Remember that in 1971 and 1972 opening up those contacts with China was regarded as the height of political audacity&mdash;of course, until Richard Nixon did the same thing, much to Billy McMahon's discomfiture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick was devoted to his wife and family. The great farewell to Mick at St Mary's Cathedral gave his many friends&mdash;I do not think he had any enemies&mdash;an opportunity to say goodbye. He was a great parliamentarian, a great public figure, a great party insider as well. The contribution he made to Australian public life and to Australian democracy was enormous.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to be associated with this condolence motion. Mick was a respected colleague of mine. I served with him in the whole of the time that he was in the parliament. But I wish today to speak particularly of the period when he was shadow minister for immigration and later Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As shadow minister, particularly working with Ian Macphee, I am sure all would understand that he brought his experience and intellect to bear, but the relationship between Ian Macphee and Mick Young was quite unique between minister and shadow minister. The bipartisanship of that period was of a standard that I thought brought very considerable benefits to Australia and was certainly of great credit to him and the minister at that time.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was said of him at the state funeral, he had a vision of life which could transcend the barriers of class and race&mdash;and this is particularly important, I think, for all those who hold this particular important position both in government and in opposition. As Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, his department became the first agency to produce an access and equity plan, and a new focus was brought to bear on citizenship and facilitating business migration, on streamlining the temporary entry policies and on computerising and speeding up the processing of entry into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, more importantly, he was the one who initiated the FitzGerald inquiry into immigration policy in September 1987. It was indicative of his commitment to the principle of non-discrimination in respect of national ethnic origin, race, sex or religion while recognising the government's right to determine who should enter and remain in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The FitzGerald inquiry, while it was not accepted in all respects by the government nor for that matter by the opposition, did consult widely with community, particularly its ethnic organisations, and prepared the way for very significant reforms to the Migration Act. It also led to the establishment of the National Council on Multicultural Affairs, which was charged with preparing the national agenda for a multicultural Australia. So these were very important benchmarks against which I think Mick can be judged and which are proper matters to record as having been initiated through the inquiry which he commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick was later to be the council's chairman and it presided over the review and updated the agenda which the government published late last year. It was a position from which he only retired in January this year. He shared membership of that council with, of course, Ian Macphee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick Young's legacy to the portfolio I now represent was a substantial one. He was concerned to translate government policy on multiculturalism into a reality. I thank him for all those efforts. I particularly extend my <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="47"> condolences and deepest sympathy to his wife, his children and his grandchild.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great sadness that I speak to this condolence motion for Mick Young, a former member for Port Adelaide, my immediate predecessor and political mentor. Port Adelaide people consider themselves a little different from the rest of urban Australia. I think this is probably well understood if you come from Port Pirie, Broken Hill, the Hunter or the Illawarra but maybe not in other places. In Port Adelaide we have two sorts of football supporters: those who barrack for Port Adelaide, and those who wish they did. We are a touch parochial and we are a touch proud in Port Adelaide. We believe that we live in a very special place with very special people who are imbued with a different sort of community spirit, one that is rarely seen in urban Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We value intense loyalty, openness and friendliness. We are a bit blunt and direct and, yes, we are pretty wary and suspicious of outsiders. We think their intellect diminishes as they go past West Terrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One old wag said to me in the by&hyphen;election of 1988, when I followed Mick Young, `I see your mum's family came to Port Adelaide in 1839. So you're not an original Portonian, are you, Rod?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">George Whitten, a close friend of Mick's and a former state member for Price, lived in Port Adelaide for 30 years before his preselection for the Labor Party. He told me he was described as the `blow&hyphen;in'. But not Mick Young.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard people swear on their mothers' graves that Mick was one of the Youngs who lived in Carnarvon Terrace, Largs North, a heartland suburb of Port Adelaide. I have heard people say that they saw him as a small boy playing in the stables of Semaphore, another heartland suburb of Port Adelaide. Of course, none of this was true, but it did not seem to matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick left school at Mosman in Sydney aged 15, went shearing in the Snowy Mountains with his brothers, then worked as an Australian Workers Union organiser before becoming <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> South Australian State Secretary of the Labor Party in 1967 and national secretary in 1969. The time spent with people in Broken Hill and Port Pirie served Mick well in his eventual preselection for Port Adelaide in 1973. He was, by that time, a national figure as the architect of the 1972 `It's Time' campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick Young took to the people of Port Adelaide with a passion and the people of Port Adelaide took to him with a passion in return. He had a special exemption from the required residential status. It was as if his family came out on the first ship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick loved the humour of Port Adelaide. The genesis of so many of those devastating one&hyphen;liners he gave to the old House of Representatives happened in places like the Port&mdash;the Club House Hotel at Colac, the Britannia, the Port Adelaide footy club and other meeting places in Port Adelaide. They came from people&mdash;our leader has mentioned some of them&mdash;such as the late big Freddy Cook; the late Leon Wilson, the unofficial mayor of Taperoo; Puffy Johnson; `Tuppence'&mdash;Robyn Porter; `the Penguin'&mdash;Jimmy Franks; `the Big Emu'&mdash;Bob Philp; and Buckets Warley. The list goes on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick loved the Labor in Port Adelaide. It was not a Labor of the left, the right or the centre; it was Labor, loyal Labor. He developed mutually loyal relationships with the Port Labor state members&mdash;Roy Abbott, George Whitten, Kevin Hamilton and Murray de Laine. He did the same with South Australian members and senators&mdash;the late Jim Toohey, the late Jim Cavanagh, the late Laurie Wallis, Don Cameron, Clyde Cameron, Chris Hurford, Reg Bishop, Ralph Jacobi, Liz Harvey, Lloyd O'Neil, Gordon Bilney&mdash;he adopted Ben Humhpreys&mdash;and the current members, especially Dominic Foreman, Chris Schacht, Rosemary Crowley and Nick Bolkus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kevin Foley, the state member for Hart, and myself are both a direct product of Mick's influence. I graduated from selling raffle tickets to be his campaign director and his successor, as Gareth has said, much too early. The day after his resignation he invited my family to his home. Mary spoke to my wife, Aldona, and his daughter Janine spoke to my children. Mick took me for a walk around the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="48"> lake and after a fairly long discussion he simply said to me, `It's you, mate.' It is a time I will not forget. It was a very humbling experience, because Mick should not have resigned, in my view, at that time. He had much to offer this Labor Party and the government of the day. I trust that I have not let him down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick built, from nothing really, the most successful Labor federal electorate council in Australia. Mick knew the true believers in Port Adelaide, people like Bob Collins, whom he appointed as Treasurer, and people like Jimmy Tuncks, an ex&hyphen;seaman, whom he appointed director of the Colac Hotel, of which Bob Collins was also a director. It says something of his choice that they still are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick listened to the community in Port Adelaide, particularly those most in need. He was rightfully very proud of his contribution towards the building of the Parks Community Centre. Mick listened to the rank and file in the party. The location of the Submarine Corporation, the duplication of the Port Wakefield Road, the South Road connector, the bridge to Salisbury, Defence jobs in Cormack Road for British Aerospace, the rail museum, the Maritime Museum&mdash;the list goes on and on&mdash;were all discussed with Mick at some time or another, either formally or informally. They all happened and are testimony to his effectiveness as a local member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think they happened because Mick was very passionate about employment opportunities for working men and women. Mick was very passionate about education, too. When I once informed him that kids in our area were dropping out of school and the level of tertiary participation was falling, he told me to set up a scholarship fund&mdash;now the Mary and Mick Young Scholarship Fund. One of the first graduates was a young man, Robert Churches, from a family of eight brothers and sisters. He was a part&hyphen;time swimming pool attendant. He wanted to become a teacher. The scholarship fund supported him for four years through his studies. Robert has been teaching for a number of years now and is currently at Lucindale in the state's south&hyphen;east. There are 100 other stories like that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which are due to that particular scholarship fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I remember most about Mick Young was that Mick loved his family&mdash;Mary, Michael, Janine, Duane, his granddaughter, Isabella, and his six brothers&mdash;and Mick loved his friends. Mick loved his many staff members&mdash;Vicky Gregory, Pauline Mannix, Luisa Halacas, Michael Wright, Ursula Doyle, Cathy Hudson, David Cox, Helen Hector, John Rau, Arja Keski&hyphen;Nummi and Nina Smyth&mdash;and Mick loved the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The memorial services that were held at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney and in Port Adelaide were, indeed, a testimony to a great Labor bloke, a great Australian and a great Port Adelaide person.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, many others have spoken about the range of the skills, attributes, experiences and contributions of Mick Young. I hope that if I do not duplicate all those, people will not think that it is a failure to appreciate his contribution as a minister, as a parliamentarian, and in many other walks of life. I want to try to add some of the things that, in my experience, were unique about Mick Young, and some perspectives which we shared and which might add something to the assessments of Mick Young in the course of this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a certain awkward symmetry about Mick's career and mine. The last national executive meeting that Mick attended as national secretary in 1973 was the first meeting that I attended. He resigned from the parliament early in 1988 just as I was about to enter it. I began to wonder whether perhaps he did not want to share either of these forums with me, but I am reasonably confident that that is not the case.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I had the opportunity in each of those areas to take up some of the work which Mick had done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick was described by Clyde Cameron as the best national secretary the Labor Party has ever had. I think that is unquestionably true. All of us who followed merely had the opportunity to build some bricks on the foundation which he laid. Many, including the present national president of the Labor Party, have said that Mick was the key architect of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="49"> transition to the modern Labor Party, and that is right. As Gough Whitlam was the architect of the policy engine that became the modern parliamentary Labor Party, so Mick Young was the architect of the organisational engine that became the modern organisational wing of the party today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people have spoken of his great contribution to the campaign in 1972, and that is well documented. What is not so well understood is his great contribution to the victory we won in 1983 when I was campaign director and Mick had the nebulous title, which we invented, of chairman of the campaign committee. For the whole duration of the campaign there actually was no campaign committee. There was the campaign director and Mick. We had to give him a title so he became chairman of the campaign committee. He was an invaluable adviser and source of inspiration and a person who saw more quickly than anyone else I have ever known the way in which issues might most effectively be communicated to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of the campaign he was, of course, a source of great disappointment to some of the media who remembered the rather more raucous role that had been played during the campaign in 1972. A journalist who had written some colour pieces about the 1972 election came across from Adelaide to write a colour piece about the 1983 campaign and invited Mick and me for lunch. He was absolutely crestfallen to find that we went to a sandwich bar and Mick ordered a milkshake. The article that he had clearly constructed before the event collapsed before his eyes. He wrote a very different article&mdash;a very positive article; but clearly not the one he had in mind at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must remember Mick's contributions to the organisation of the party in Victoria, South Australia and elsewhere. It is now forgotten that in many ways the state branch that he and many others helped create in South Australia in the 1960s was the model on which many&mdash;perhaps all&mdash;of the subsequent reforms of Labor Party branches throughout Australia were based. The role that he and the then leader of the Labor Party, Don Dunstan, played became the model for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the modern Labor governments throughout all the states in the subsequent 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond his campaign ability, his organisational ability, and his capacity to bring people together and make them work in a broader, more participatory way than had been the tradition in at least some of the Australian states, he was a key figure in the political life of our generation. This is true of the Labor Party, of course, but, given the role he played in the achievement of government at both the state and federal level over those 30 years, he became a key figure in the whole political life of Australia for that generation. He had an influence extending far beyond his life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Others have spoken about his role in the reform of the electoral laws and of his commitment to parliament and the democracy. I do not want to duplicate those remarks; merely to endorse them. I think one would say of Mick that he left the Labor Party and the parliament inestimably better than he found them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that we will not find another Mick Young because the forces that created exactly that character were a product of the era in which he grew up. The job he did in the 1960s and beyond&mdash;particularly in South Australia, and then nationally, going right back to 1964&mdash;needs to be done in each new generation in a different way. The best tribute that those of us who knew him and who wish to build on his work can pay is not to seek to recreate 1968 or 1972, but to develop a contemporary 21st century Labor Party to give the sort of leadership to the next generation of Australians that Mick helped us give his generation. I am delighted to support the motion and to convey my personal regards to his family and to all his friends.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to associate myself with this motion. Mick Young was an extraordinarily popular figure in my home state of South Australia and was, as others have said before me, a centrally important figure in that state as well as nationally. There is no doubt that when we all heard of his death a few days ago there was a great sense of sorrow throughout South Australia on all sides of politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="50">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick Young's popularity can be measured by the fact that when he retired in 1988 as the member for Port Adelaide, taking into account the vagaries of by&hyphen;elections, there was something like an 11 per cent or 12 per cent swing in that by&hyphen;election away from the Australian Labor Party. I do not know whether the present member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) has made all of that up again. Nevertheless, it was an indication of how tremendously popular Mick Young was. He was not just popular in Port Adelaide, he was popular wherever you went. He was popular with his political foes who did not agree with him always, and I certainly did not, but felt no bitterness towards him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my perspective, I always admired him as somebody who was totally dedicated to his cause in the most sincere of ways possible. He was not just ambitious for himself to advance his own personal career, but was ambitious for the people he professed to represent and for the principles in which he believed. He was very much a traditional Labor figure and he was, as the member for Port Adelaide quite rightly said, a figure of Port Adelaide itself. Just this last Sunday I was in Port Adelaide with my father&hyphen;in&hyphen;law and my son and we drove past the Colac Hotel. You cannot help but think of Mick Young when you drive past a place like that. You could go so far as to say that for many years Mick Young was the personification of Port Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) will not mind me saying this, but in my time as a member of this place, which is since December 1984, Mick Young has been the outstanding Leader of the House. He was a person who had a great capacity to turn around the mood of the House when the then government, naturally enough, was in trouble from the very effective attacks of the then opposition. Mick Young was a great one for saving the day&mdash;getting the dorothy dix question asked and making all sorts of humorous but rather poignant remarks about his political opponents.</PARA>

This was not true. We did not have a two&hyphen;storey doll's house&mdash;and, no, we did not have a one&hyphen;storey doll's house. None of this was true.

But we are, and in that context I would like to add a few remarks to the very fine remarks that have already been made about Mick Young.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I knew Mick through all my parliamentary life. In fact, he presided over my preselection because he was, as has been mentioned, federal secretary of the party at the beginning of the 1970s when federal intervention occurred in Victoria. He became secretary of the Victorian party and in this first preselection under the new regime he introduced the revolutionary approach for the Victorian branch of giving every member of the party in the electorate a vote. So that resulted in my preselection. He became a parliamentary colleague after 1974, a shadow ministerial colleague from 1976 to 1983 and a ministerial colleague from 1983 to 1988, with a few unfortunate sojourns in the penalty box.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick had many admirable qualities and they have all been mentioned by previous speakers. But I particularly point out his great capacity as a yarn teller. He absolutely adored telling yarns and he was tremendously good at it. His use of rhyming slang was something which was quite astonishing to me. He just delighted in using it in a way which confounded people and then having the joy of explaining what it all meant. His love of a beer and convivial company has been mentioned by others. He was a man of almost invariably good spirits. He radiated good humour, bonhomie and joie de vivre. He was a pleasure to be with at all times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in those rare times when he was depressed about some matter&mdash;of course there were those occasions&mdash;he always bounced back. He had great regard for his friends and colleagues. He would always go out of his way to console them when they were down, although perhaps in a chiding and mocking <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> way which was nevertheless well intentioned and generally well received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example of his great concern for others was a phone call I received from him soon after the last election in which he consoled me about the result of the election. It was only in the course of that phone call that I learned that he was actually suffering from leukemia, yet he was ringing to console me. He bore this affliction, as has been mentioned, with great stoicism and, as it eventuated, misplaced optimism. But I was immensely impressed that even in these circumstances he still had this irrepressible good humour and he had me laughing despite the sadness of his news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But he was no mere caring comedian, as has been said by others. Mick was a shrewd and canny politician and a great parliamentary performer. He was a great party official, and I do not need to elaborate on that. His quick wit and great one-liners ensured that he excelled in parliamentary repartee and made him a formidable parliamentary opponent. He had that unique ability to make the person who was the subject of the mockery or the ridicule laugh along with everyone else. I could never understand why that was so, but perhaps this was because he always laughed at his own jokes. I must say that is a fairly annoying trait in others, but in Mick somehow it was a likeable trait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite some well publicised misjudgments when he was a minister, for which he paid heavily, his political judgments were generally very sound indeed. I regarded him as a great source of political wisdom in the party and in the cabinet. In cabinet he had that great and rare ability to puncture high flying rhetoric or to get through turgid detail and bring the discussion back to the coalface of political reality. To give one instance of that, we were having a discussion once about telecommunications policy and somebody mentioned that they had seen some reference in the press to timed telephone calls. This started some discussion on that subject and, as this was going on, Mick brought it back and virtually ended the discussion by saying, `Well, I dunno who it is who's promoting this stuff <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="52"> but I know one thing's for sure&mdash;he hasn't got any teenage kids.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick also had that extraordinary ability to mix well at any level. He looked equally at home in a pub with the boys, in tough political meetings in the parliament or in the company of the rich and powerful. But he genuinely enjoyed the company of working&hyphen;class people and identified very much with them. His career as a union official with the AWU ensured this identification was turned to a dedication to assist the ordinary working people of Australia. I remember him saying to me when we were both ministers, `What a thing to be&mdash;a working&hyphen;class hero!' He meant that he would love to be one, but the irony of the situation was that to the many workers who knew him that is already exactly what he was. Although he enjoyed good food, good company and the good life, he never forgot his roots and he never forgot what he was in politics to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said by the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), it is a great tragedy that Mick ended his parliamentary life and then had his mortal life ended far too soon. He was greatly missed as a parliamentary and ministerial colleague when he resigned from parliament in 1988. He will be greatly missed as a friend and colleague now that he has gone to that great shearing shed in the sky.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I express my very sincere condolences to his wife Mary, his family, his children and his wider family. In their grief they at least have the satisfaction of knowing that his was a life that really mattered; that he contributed greatly to the cause to which he was passionately devoted; that the deprivations and travails that they bore through his absences and his involvement in political turmoil were not in vain; and that he will be long and fondly remembered by the vast array of people whose lives he touched and enriched in the course of his exceptional life.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had a very special relationship with Mick Young which arose out of some of the internal traumas in the Labor Party in Victoria. If you want to have a fun time in politics, try having an exercise in federal intervention when in fact at various levels of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the party, at both a federal and a state level, you have got those who quite sincerely believe that they had a role to preserve their view of political purity and that that was more important than winning elections. It came to a head in my state, and when Mick had to play the very active role that he did as the then federal secretary his presence was absolutely vital and necessary and his political judgments were inevitably sound.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those of us who were political leaders at that time, people who one had grown up with in the party, friends of long standing, became political enemies overnight. That certainly affected me, it affected the federal leader, but at no stage did it affect Mick Young. In all of that heady exercise I never heard, at any level, a criticism of Mick. If you want to get into that sort of dogfight, having someone like Mick, with his good sense of humour and his capacity to relate to people, is essential. That exercise changed the course of Labor history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The stories about Mick are legendary. My other colleagues have mentioned his sense of humour. I have seen him turn debates both within the party and within this parliament with a wisecrack made at the right time. For those new members of this parliament, there was a time when the then opposition decided that the most important thing in Australia was for the chair from Old Parliament House to be brought in here, even if it involved knocking half the building down. I recommend the reading of that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to anyone who was here, because by the time Mick had finished, without reflecting in any way upon the opposition, the opposition was laughing at itself. I have never seen that before, having spent over 30 years in two parliaments. It was a unique capacity, the like of which I hope we will see again, although I doubt it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Mick got into his rhyming slang with Ben Humphreys and Eric Walsh, one somehow felt a little left out of the conversation. You might as well have been sitting down with several Tibetan monks speaking Tibetan. His capacity not merely to tell a story but to invent a story, particularly if it involved a close political associate, was legendary. On more than one occasion I was the victim of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="53"> Mick's humour, involving a story that I do not think bears repeating in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick will not merely pass into the history of the Labor Party for the job that he did for this parliament and the organisational structure but he will become part of the legend of the Labor Party. He served it in an administrative capacity. He was a great parliamentarian. His capacity on the floor of this House I do not think I have seen equalled on many occasions. He was devoted to his electorate and the people he represented. I believe that he has already not only become a Labor hero and regarded as one of the architects of a different sort of Labor Party but also become a part of the folklore of a party which was born out of adversity and which represents the hopes and aspirations of working people. He was always an outstanding exponent in the good times and the hard times for that community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His early death has affected all of us. I express sympathy to his family and his wife, Mary. As a family they had to bear not just the tribulations of the last few months but Mick's constant absence from home as he carried out his range of duties. There is nobody on this side of the House that does not owe Mick and his family, who made sacrifices by virtue of his responsibilities, a debt of gratitude. His name will always have a very honoured place not merely amongst those who knew him but, when the history of this party is written, for future generations of Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to join with others in this House in this condolence motion for Mick. Unlike the others who have spoken, I did not serve in this parliament with Mick. I came here in 1990, two years after he prematurely left it&mdash;a point that has been made by many on this side. My association with him spans more than a quarter of a century and it goes back to the time that many have mentioned&mdash;his involvement in the intervention of the Victorian branch of the Labor Party, a time when I was starting my career in the labour movement with the then Storemen and Packers Union. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick was one of the architects of the intervention but, more than that, he had to implement it. That is a very difficult double task. It means courage as well as foresight in the initial stages. Mick had both. The reality is that, as a result of those sorts of decisions, what happened in Victoria in 1970 was the precursor to the modern Labor Party&mdash;a Labor Party that not only won office with the Whitlam government in 1972 but also dominated federal politics and lot of state politics for the following 20 years. In that sense, we owe a lot to Mick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick struggled in the early days in Victoria. It was a very lonely experience. That fact has been referred to. I remember back to 1971, when we found those restaurants that Barry Jones said he took time finding in Melbourne. We went up to Carlton one night. I was fortunate enough to be invited, along with Bill Landeryou, who was the secretary of my union. Tom Burns and Mick Young were there. As we walked back to the Trades Hall&mdash;and members in Victoria might remember the small church that was beside it&mdash;we noticed there was banner up out the front which read, `If you died tomorrow, where would you spend eternity?' When Tom Burns read this to Mick, Mick said, `Where else but Victoria.' It is an indication that, even in the difficult periods, the times when he felt lonely and wondered where it was all going to end because he had many enemies and few friends, he could still see the humour and, in a self&hyphen;effacing way, relate it back to his own circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have spoken here today of the way in which he was able to use wit to great effect in the parliament. I recall the way he used his serious side to great effect in the parliament and how he showed some degree of duplicity in the parliament. Again, this was at the expense of the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was in 1980 and my union had been involved and still was involved in a very lengthy wool dispute. Wool was not moving. It also happened to be at the time when Malcolm Fraser was urging a boycott of the Moscow Olympics because of the invasion into Afghanistan. The question that Mick was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="54"> tellingly able to ask in the context of an industrial relations dispute was: what sort of procedures were being used to move wool bales labelled `Nareen' so that they could be supplied to the Soviet economy? It was a very telling point because the Prime Minister of the day hated it and, from memory, he stormed out. I think this highlighted what became something of a slogan in the 1970s&mdash;that is, that Malcolm's wool was keeping the Russians warm. At the same time he was actively out there advocating a boycott by our athletes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been spoken about Mick's role in the shadow ministry and ministry. When I was the president of the trade union movement, Mick was always the first Labor politician to ring about ACTU congresses and ask about the sessions and the order. He was always there. He believed very much in keeping in touch with the trade union movement. He was always welcomed to the ACTU congresses and, between congresses, to the John Curtin Hotel, where we were still meeting on regular occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many things have been said about what Mick achieved as a minister. I simply want to repeat those points which I think have been fundamental to the strengthening of our democratic values in this country: the declaration of political donations; the legislation embodied in the one&hyphen;vote, one&hyphen;value system; redistributions&mdash;we are not too happy about them when they affect us in our own seats, but the principle is very important and it was Mick more than others who pursued that&mdash;and the public funding of election campaigns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick joined a proud group of very effective immigration ministers, many of them on our side of the parliament. I just want to underpin the point that whatever Mick put his mind and commitment to he did exceedingly well. Port Adelaide was always a great place to visit. I remember many occasions at the Colac Hotel and at the Port Adelaide Football Club. The community spirit that has been referred to in Port Adelaide and through the football club was carried on. I must say that pleased me because it was the first club to offer job opportunities, through its contacts, to unemployed people in Port Adelaide, where there <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was a very high level of youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the sorts of legacies Mick left at the local and community level. He was very much a grassroots politician, whether representing people in this place or being in the industrial and political wings, involved in organisational aspects of the party. He did it better than anyone I know. Mick did epitomise the bridge between old Labor and modern Labor. He had the common touch but he was never out of touch. Indeed, Mick's astuteness and ability to be so perceptive about issues that he could give that wise counsel that all of us have experienced at some stage was due to the fact that he had a great political antenna. He kept in touch, he knocked around, he knew what the issues were and he had a great gut instinct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was also a tremendous social leveller. It did not matter what group you went into, Mick was always comfortable and made others comfortable in that environment. He did all this with warmth, compassion and dedication. He was much loved and admired not only in this House but also in the wider community. We will miss him because he did leave us, not just here but in life, far too young.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My condolences to Mary, his wife of 36 years, who was a constant source of support and companionship. He spoke often of you, Mary, when he was away with us on his own. My condolences to Michael. Many people have talked about the service at St Mary's Cathedral. I think one of the moving speeches was made by Michael, who referred to his father as his best mate. I think the circumstances where sons and fathers can also be best mates is a great tribute to the relationship and the family commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My condolences to Janine, who got Mick out to a Rolling Stones concert that I also happened to be at. I could not quite work out whether it was your role, Janine, in keeping him in touch with the community or whether he was just reliving the past. I think that, when he was talking to me, it was the latter. We had a great night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My condolences to Duane and to Isabella. We all know how much Mick adored Isabella, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="55"> his grand daughter. My sincere condolences to all of you. I know you do miss him; that came through at the funeral service. But we miss him, too, and our thoughts are with you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us here appreciate the support from your family&mdash;without your knowledge at times&mdash;in the taking of Mick's time over the years and I appreciate the comradeship I received from him. Mick was a true son of the labour movement who never forgot his roots. He remained accessible to all throughout his career, no matter the stations he came to occupy at various stages of that career. Like the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), I first met him in a preselection. Would you believe it was the Shortland preselection?</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You remember it, do you? I happen to remember it, too. At one stage during that preselection he had the temerity to accuse me of not being able to count. He told me to go away and learn how to count. That was when we first met. In the 25 years that followed he always remained as approachable, easygoing and humorous as when I first met him. That was one of his great qualities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was ever ready to help out with a Labor cause or a community cause. His sense of humour was spontaneous, sparkling and, at times, destructive. It did not carry malice or ill will, as previous speakers have said. I often thought of him and Fred Daly as a kind of twins&mdash;not in age, but in style, behaviour and presentation. They both used similar weapons and both had a similar spontaneity and a pleasure in company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier, the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) mentioned Mick's great presence of mind. I remember an occasion down <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at the Old Parliament House&mdash;the temporary and provisional Parliament House, where I am sure Mick's spirit still roams around the corridors&mdash;when Andrew Peacock, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, held the chamber enthralled as he rolled through a major debate on foreign affairs. The government was besting us; there was no doubt about that. Andrew had the parliament virtually in the palm of his hands. But, like all of us, at one stage he had to pause to draw breath. He paused for just an instant and in that instant, that quietness, Mick called out, `Hey, Andrew. Give us your angry look!' Andrew could not help it; he looked down at Mick at the table on this side, and just for that moment the corners of his mouth started to move. He grabbed hold of himself, but it was too late, and the debate was lost&mdash;just in that fraction of a moment, with that quip from Mick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick, like Fred, was a graduate of the greatest university of all: the university of experience. He was a great member of this party who came out of mainstream Australia. He had a career in life first. He did not come into the parliament as a professional politician or straight out of university or tertiary education. He knew what it was like to be without. He carried that figure of the shearer&mdash;the shearers stoop, which we always tormented him about, which brought with it the bad back that was referred to earlier and from which so many shearers and former shearers suffer. As a man out of mainstream Australia he understood, felt for and could empathise with working Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In more recent years, Ben Humphreys, then the member for Griffith, occupied an office just down the corridor from me. Ben and Mick regularly met, and Mick passed my office on his way to Ben's. Ben has now left the gallery, but he was here earlier. When Mick and Ben got together, there were always episodes of rhyming slang and catching up on each other's stories. Like my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), I had difficulty in trying to interpret what they were talking about sometimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, my younger brother Dr John and Mick shared considerable expertise&mdash;so they used to tell me&mdash;and knowledge <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="56"> about matters related to the turf. On numerous occasions I reprimanded them about that&mdash;but to no avail&mdash;as I thought it was a waste of skill and talent. But it was interesting when one would accuse the other, when one had taken advice from the other, when the sequence of arrivals at the winning post was not as predicted, as assuredly would happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned Mick's readiness to help out with community causes. As patron of the authentic operating replica of the first steamship built in Australia, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">William IV</EMPHASIS>, I asked Mick back in 1991 to chair for me a fundraising evening for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">William IV</EMPHASIS> at New South Wales Parliament House. Mick was to chair it and Fred was to be the guest speaker. Gough came along as a paying guest and thought it was uproarious that, on the day after St Patrick's Day, at this great and very successful fundraising function, we had these two notable Irishmen&mdash;he called them `notable Irishmen', but we should say, I suppose, that they were Australians of Irish origin&mdash;celebrating William IV, the butcher of the Irish! So they were flexible. Mick was flexible; whatever the cause, it was no problem for Mick to hop in and help out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia must express to each member of the Young family&mdash;to Mary, Janine, Michael, Duane, Isabella and the brothers Young&mdash;our grateful thanks. It was mentioned earlier, but I want to dwell on it a little more, that only those of us who work in this place know the sacrifices that our families make. Only those of us who work here know the hours, the days, the weeks, that Mick spent away from you, working for Australia in this place and helping each of us in so many ways. I want to say to you and to all the family: thank you. We are grateful. He did your family a great honour. He did Australia a great service. In the labour movement, the trade union movement, his role was an unstinting and noble one. He began as an ordinary man who came to do extraordinary things. He was an extraordinary son of the labour movement and the trade union movement. We honour his service. We honour his memory. He may not be here with us, but his presence will be here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much has been said about all the dimensions of the work of Mick Young and I want to concentrate on one area in which I had the most dealings with him and in which he was also loved. I refer to the contribution he made to multicultural Australia. It may not be so well known, but Mick Young was loved by the ethnic communities of Australia and he was a very passionate supporter of multiculturalism. Although he had other things to do, one of Mick's last public works was, as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has mentioned, to chair the National Multicultural Advisory Council. In his chairman's introduction to its report in June last year titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Multicultural Australia: the next steps: towards and beyond 2000</EMPHASIS> , Mick Young again reflected on his vision for Australia. I will just read two short paragraphs:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, this report was developed against the backdrop of the High Court's Mabo decision on land rights for Australia's indigenous peoples, and in the midst of the reconciliation process. These developments are of profound importance, not only for a multicultural Australia, but also for the continuing evolution of our national identity. Such considerations have at their heart the very nature of Australian identity. These are issues relevant to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent years have seen a great deal of discussion about what Australian society might be like in the year 2000 and beyond. The Council believes that in a world of rapid change, new opportunities for obtaining further benefits from our multicultural society will continue to be found, and that we should strive to identify and overcome any remaining impediments to true Access and Equity for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Mick's commitment to multiculturalism began even before he became shadow minister. In my first dealings with him as shadow minister we used to huddle together and discuss the new policy that was to go forth for the 1983 election. Ursula Doyle, his faithful assistant and who I think is here today, worked with us to develop this very important policy which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="57"> helped us win very significant support from the ethnic communities of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick continued to take an interest in multicultural and immigration affairs, and he became the minister in that area. Some people used to think that was not a very high position, given that he also held the very important position of Leader of the House, but he was absolutely delighted to become Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. In that role he performed very credibly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick did a very important thing in 1986 when the government had been forced to make some very tough decisions. These decisions were seen to have disproportionately hit the ethnic and multicultural communities of Australia. Mick Young, when he became minister shortly after those decisions were made, set about finding out what the ethnic communities thought about them. It came to his attention when he as minister went around Australia to listen to people, which he did on many issues, that they were all concerned about the decision to amalgamate the SBS and the ABC. Everywhere he went the ethnic leaders were all saying that they could not live with that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the parliament had passed a motion in the House of Representatives and the party had supported that motion, Mick was honest enough to call a special meeting of the immigration committee&mdash;I remember this as I was chairman and this was a very important day&mdash;and said, `I have something to tell this committee. I have listened to the communities and it's become clear to me that, overwhelmingly, our ethnic communities are opposed to this decision. I've spoken to the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and have persuaded him to reverse that decision.' Of course, the committee supported him. Only three days later, at a major function in I think the Greek community in Melbourne, the Prime Minister announced that the Labor Party had reversed the decision to amalgamate the SBS and the ABC. This was received very joyfully by the ethnic communities of Australia at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> When Mick resigned as immigration minister on 8 February 1988, we were all shocked because he had been such an excel lent Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. There was so much pain in the ethnic communities of Australia about this resignation. Everyone wondered why it had happened because he was still so full of life, as other people have said, and he had so much to contribute to Australia in general and also, more particularly, to the area of immigration and ethnic affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned at the beginning of my contribution, Mick continued to make a contribution where he could and he chaired that very important committee. As a result of that committee, the Labor government, in one of its final acts, produced the policy Our Nation, which is a direct response to the agenda he put forward and which sets the agenda for a multicultural Australia towards the year 2000 and beyond. So Mick Young's contribution was, as I said, multi-dimensional, but in this particular area he will be much remembered. I can say that all those communities think of him extremely fondly and are very grateful for the contribution he made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To Mary and the rest of the family, let me say not only did Mick have a great vision for Australia; he had a great vision for a multicultural Australia in which every person, irrespective of where they came from, could be equal in a very genuine sense. He made a tremendous contribution to that. I think the whole nation can be grateful for it.</PARA></SPEECH>

Mick was a great supporter of me in my campaign in Barton, even after he was diagnosed as suffering from leukemia. He organised a fundraising breakfast as recently as 16 February at what has now become famous, as a result of Mick, as Suzi Carlton's Hotel in Paddington. Simply as a result of Mick getting on the phone to his friends, many of whom had never met me, there was a substantial roll&hyphen;up at that fundraising breakfast.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick had a way of making what otherwise would seem stressful or traumatic a great adventure. I remember two comments made by Mick on that day. One was a joke which I cannot repeat in this House, but the other was his comment to me, again in the serious vein that has been noted, that the opportunity to serve in parliament is an honour which comes to so very few. It was a feature of great encouragement to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A comment which I would like to make is that, having been a lawyer in my former capacity, I had the honour of working for the Australian Workers Union and working in some instances very closely with Michael Young. I can assure the House that Michael has many of the qualities of his father&mdash;his competence, his dedication and indeed his good humour. I am sure that in many ways the spirit of Mick Young very much lives on. From my point of view, the McClelland-Young friendship will survive for many years, as indeed I suspect the Young friendship with the Labor movement will.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to be associated with this condolence motion. I want to emphasise that all of those things that have been said about Mick Young this evening Mick Young thoroughly deserved, and so did Mary and the family. The fact that at Mick's funeral service there was the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), three former Prime Ministers, so many colleagues of Mick and so many friends from so many different areas of activity and so many geographical areas attests to the correctness of all of those things that have been said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick and Mary's son, Michael, when he was speaking, told how Mick would spend money on books for the family, even on those occasions when Mary perhaps believed that they were running short of cash for clothes. His dad's response was, `Do you want the kids to grow up being the best dressed idiots in the town?' Mick was very conscious of that. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick and I were appointed to Broken Hill in the mid-1950s at the same time. He was appointed to the shearing sheds and I was appointed to the local high school. While he was down in the trades hall in Broken Hill addressing union meetings from the boxing ring in that building, which is probably still known as the Kremlin, I was up at the high school teaching kids. We did not know one another then, but I think we got to know one another pretty well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reference has been made to Mick's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I Want to Work</EMPHASIS>. Mick was responsible for a lot of articles, a lot of speeches and a lot of things that have been recorded in library histories, in local histories, in the history of the parliament and in the history of the party. But the fact that one of Mick's major works was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I Want to Work</EMPHASIS> reflects more than anything else Mick's attitude towards the rights and the basic human dignity of all of those people he was concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he wrote that book he was the Labor opposition spokesman on employment and industrial relations. In the first chapter he refers to a week in a member's office, dealing with the problems of unemployment and the problems of the unemployed. In his chapter on blaming the victims, he wrote, `To many Australians and especially conservative politicians the unemployed are to blame for being unemployed.' He said, `The victims have become the scapegoats.' That is an expression which many of us have frequently used since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This next quote probably sums up better than any other single statement Mick's concern about the rights of ordinary people, and especially their right to work&mdash;their right to the fundamental human dignity of being able to contribute to society and to earn an income for themselves, their families and dependants. Mick said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployment is a disease, a cancer. It destroys individuals, divides and breaks up homes, wastes human potential and increases crime and drug use. If we apply accountants' rules and are concerned only with money, the cost is astronomical. But in Canberra, where economic policies are formed, slogans hide facts. "Fight inflation first" has a fine, tough ring to it and must be pleasant to hear if you are living in Toorak on unearned income from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="59"> shares. For more than one million Australians it means life below the poverty line.</PARA>
<PARA>I have said that Mick and I were appointed to Broken Hill at the same time in the mid-1950s. The party has treated me very well. I would like to think that I have made a limited contribution. Mick was always proud of the fact, as you know, that he came from the shearing sheds. Although Mick went out to Broken Hill at the same time I did&mdash;as I said, he went to the shearing sheds&mdash;I can with genuine modesty acknowledge, applaud and marvel at that man's achievements and contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much has been said. Mary and the family made sacrifices to make it possible for Mick to make those contributions. He was quite clearly away from home for an enormous amount of time in order for him to be, at different times, the National Secretary of the Labor Party, the National President of the Labor Party, a federal minister with a group of portfolios for which he was responsible, the Leader of the House and the Vice-President of the Executive Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was one of about six people who could claim responsibility for the reformation of the ALP. As others have said, in 1972 he was one of the essential architects of that magnificent campaign `It's Time', which brought us back out of the wilderness after 23 years. He was involved in all of those achievements that Andrew Theophanous referred to, for example, in multiculturalism, in questions of immigration and in those enormously important electoral reforms&mdash;consolidating, entrenching, firming the principles of democracy and important democratic principles in the national structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick very generously came up to my electorate. My electorate, which is in the Hunter, is part of Labor's heartland. I appreciate the fact that Mary obviously released him again so that he could come up and be the special guest at a local history conference that my federal electorate council organised. We wanted him to be not only the special guest but also the special speaker, with reference to his experiences in the history of the Labor Party. I am so very proud of this and I am so delighted that Mick Young came up.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the opportunity when introducing Mick to refer to what was clearly a classic reply that he gave to a question on one occasion. I will not read out all of the answer, but it really was a classic. I know that the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), as a student of the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> when he was in the Senate, would have undoubtedly read this answer and enjoyed it as much as everyone else did. Mick was asked a question about market research in connection with politics, politicians and so on. He went on in some detail on a number of things. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here is the coup de grace of the market research surveys which are having so much impact on our lives, and it may cause some disturbance to honourable members sitting in this chamber, both to those on this side as much as to those on the other side. The survey shows that if anything unfortunate should happen to our Prime Minister&mdash;God help us&mdash;the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Premier of New South Wales, I am next in line.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not know what Gareth thinks about this. I thank the honourable member . . . for his question and I hope that I have enlightened him.</PARA>
<PARA>So he was also, of course, able to take a joke at his own expense. He was a great raconteur, a great humorist, a person with no venom, no vengeance, no vindictiveness, no deliberate hurt. He inflicted no deliberate pain, except perhaps on capitalism, and he would have been very happy to reform it even more. But Mick Young had genuine concern for ordinary people, their rights and their dignity. People have said here tonight, quite correctly, that not only will Mick live in the history of the Labor Party and the labour movement; Mick Young has become part of the fabric of the Labor Party and the labour movement. I say to you, Mary, to Michael, to Janine and to the wider family, that I join with others in expressing to you my own deep personal sympathy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like so many people of my generation, there were three really defining events of my teenage years. The first was the Kennedy assassination; the second was the Vietnam War, which continued through much of my high schooling; and the third, shortly after my 19th birthday, was in many ways the most <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="60"> important, and that was the `It's Time' campaign for which Mick had such great responsibility. It inspired me to join the ALP soon after the 1972 federal election. But at the time it so moved those of my generation that I handed out how&hyphen;to&hyphen;vote cards for the party without even being a member at that point. When I did join, finally, Mick was still the state secretary in South Australia and the federal secretary nationally. He played a very important part in the lives of my political generation and provided the inspiration for many of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a young member of the party, I was aware of his friendly manner, his easygoing style, his ready wit and humour, but also, and very importantly, his organisational skills and his leadership. Although I sat on the floor of the convention hall and at party meetings and Mick was on the podium or the stage as the state secretary or the federal secretary, when we met informally at social functions or at party functions afterwards, he was always there to provide a kind word or an encouraging thought to the younger members of the party. He was never too preoccupied with his office or too self&hyphen;important to share the good times and occasionally the bad with all members of the party&mdash;not just the leaders, premiers and prime ministers with whom he moved so freely, but the young, the old, the ordinary members of the party who were at that time the front line in the days of letterboxing and door&hyphen;knocking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I next met up with Mick when he was Special Minister of State and had responsibility for the Federal Police. At that time I worked as the state Police Minister and Minister for Emergency Services. In that capacity, I often met with Mick in his capacity as the Special Minister of State. We shared many conferences together&mdash;police ministers conferences and the like&mdash;and I got to see a different side of Mick. He was a very efficient political operative in that context but one who was able to bring people together and ensure that ideas were shared by those with like&hyphen;minded views and who wanted to move forward in those very difficult areas. He brought those qualities which we have spoken of this evening very strongly, not only as a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> state and federal secretary in the party, as a minister in the Commonwealth government, but as the ultimate true believer in the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following my election to the Commonwealth parliament, I again had an opportunity to make contact with Mick and saw him on a number of occasions here in Canberra&mdash;the most recent occasion only a few months ago. His unfailing charm, wit and humour were certainly responsible for inspiring many people in my generation and for ensuring that this parliament functioned in a particularly effective way during his time here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has left us with a great legacy and a great history. I certainly extend my condolences to his wife and to his family in their time of grief.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to be associated with the many remarks and tributes which have been made this afternoon and this evening for Mick Young. I will not repeat many of the tributes that have already been made by members who served with Mick in the parliament for a longer period than I, other than to repeat what a great contribution he made to the Labor Party as the national secretary, in rebuilding the structure of the party and in policy areas like China. No&hyphen;one has yet mentioned state aid, but Mick Young played a very constructive role with people like Eric Walsh in helping Archbishop Carroll make that important statement before the 1972 election that it was not a sin to vote Labor at that crucial time. I refer also to the great work he did not just in opposition but in government. Lots of people have mentioned his work in persuading the parliament and getting the legislation through to guarantee one vote, one value and the disclosure of political donations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some of us in this parliament&mdash;a few in the chamber now&mdash;who, as part of the class of 84, would not be here but for the fact that Mick was able to persuade the National Party to vote with Labor to increase the size of the House of Representatives. Many of us will be grateful for that reform, as well as the introduction of one vote, one value and the declaration of donations. The member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) mentioned <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="61"> Mick's support for the fundraising for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">William IV</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a wonderful vessel. But Mick was not quite as helpful to people like the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and Peter Morris when they were campaigning to build some submarines at Newcastle. Mick Young fought with great passion and determination to persuade the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) that those submarines could best be built in Adelaide. I am sure all the people who now work in that area in Adelaide and in the many jobs that will be created not just in Adelaide but right around Australia as a result of his success in that campaign will always remember the great lobbying effort that Mick put into that campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For myself, having entered the parliament in 1984, my fondest recollections of Mick are at the Old Parliament House. The member for Mayo, Alexander Downer, mentioned that famous answer in question time. Just the recollection of Mick in full flight in that smaller chamber&mdash;no&hyphen;one will ever best that. I can also recall on many occasions Mick holding court with people like Ben Humphreys and the current Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, late at night in that room next to the old dining room over tea, hot chocolate and coffee and all sorts of stories being regaled. That is a recollection that will always be with us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick was very generous to me as a backbencher, going out of his way to point out numerous mistakes and hints on how to improve. As a minister, he was always a source of wise advice. A few of us&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and I&mdash;had a rather close call at the last election. Almost every day Mick was on the phone from his hospital bed at St Vincent's, wanting the detailed breakdown of how the count had gone in Dobell that day&mdash;and no doubt wanting the same from Kim and Arch as well. I certainly appreciated the interest that Mick showed in a time of crisis for me when he was no doubt in pain and going through enormous difficulty himself at St Vincent's.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is great to see that the torch carried by Mick through the union movement, in the Labor Party and in the national parliament has now been passed to Michael, who is now carrying it with distinction inside the union. Perhaps one day either Michael or another one of the Young family might be in this chamber&mdash;perhaps Isabella&mdash;carrying the torch in future days. We will miss Mick's wise counsel and his infectious humour. I am sure that every member of the Labor Party right throughout Australia extends their deepest sympathy to Mary, Janine, Michael and every member of the family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the requiem mass at St Mary's, I was sitting there proudly reflecting on the fact that I regarded myself as a personal friend of Mick's&mdash;having stayed with him at his unit in Sydney and having met with him and his business colleagues many times after he had left the parliament, and things like that&mdash;until one of the speakers said that there were a thousand people at St Mary's and every one was a personal friend of Mick's; and that is the fact of it. We all thought we were and we could not have been but we must have been, and we will always claim for all our lives that we were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also felt, Michael, that in your contribution, in the speech you made, there was so much of your father in your voice, your mannerisms and your passion&mdash;and you should proudly remember that, and rightly so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two brief anecdotes I would like to tell. I think it was in 1986 or 1987&mdash;and the financial members of the club in which Mick had deemed himself unfinancial will remember the detail better, but I think it was in 1987&mdash;there was a visit to Australia by His Holiness Pope John Paul II. I remember that I, as a marginal backbencher, complained to Mick that at every one of these big dos in Canberra there would be, first of all, the ministers, the politicians, then all the senior bureaucrats and then all the military heavies&mdash;and we would never get any ordinary people at them. He said, `Mate, I can't work miracles but I'll see what I can do.' A couple of days later all the members got a letter inviting them to bring two guests to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="62"> reception here at Parliament House. I conveyed that offer to the two largest Catholic congregations in my electorate. And, to this day, those congregations remain immensely proud of the fact that they had two representatives at the Old Parliament House at that reception for His Holiness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other memory I would like to share is one that Mick does not know about. Just after he left the parliament and Kim Beazley was appointed as the Leader of the House, something happened&mdash;I forget what the circumstances were&mdash;and I had the one great joke and one-liner that I have ever thought of. I rushed around to Kim and said `Hey, here's a great one-liner you can use; you'll sound just like Mick.' Very wisely, Kim said to me, `If I try to be like Mick, I'll make a fool of myself.' I think you essentially decided not to try to be like Mick, to avoid the comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick achieved one final thing in his death, and that was at the requiem mass. I suppose you would say that in the Labor Party we feel our traditions strongly, proudly; our bonds are very strong, our fallouts are very bitter. To see Gough Whitlam, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating sit together and resolve their differences in a public bond at Mick's funeral, I felt was one final great thing Mick did for Labor memories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new member for Barton (Mr McClelland) made the comment that Mick was very proud of being here and proud of the fact that the Labor Party could bring ordinary people to this place. In the same way that he spoke to you, Robert, he said to me once, when I was talking to him about one of my lows here, `Mate, never forget, if you're in this joint, life's dealt you five aces'&mdash;and he was absolutely right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mary, you should know. I remember at my father-in-law's funeral how amazed my wife and her mother were at the show of public support, the great turn&hyphen;up. They did not ever really know the number of people who regarded my father-in-law so well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brought it home to them. There is no doubt that what has happened since Mick died has brought it home to you. In just about every conversation he had with us, Mary's name came up: whether it was seeking advice <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about how to keep our personal lives together while we were here or whether it was a bit of political wisdom which he would punctuate with, `That is what Mary reckons too.' You came up all the time. I want you to know that. We convey the thoughts that have been expressed tonight and we are all very proud to say, and always say, that we think we were personal friends of Mick Young.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I suppose it would be very true to say that Mick Young touched more lives than anyone else that any of us in this place would know. I think that was evidenced very much by the attendance at the requiem mass at St Mary's Cathedral. When one looked around that large cathedral one saw thousands of people&mdash;as other speakers have said&mdash;who all considered themselves to be a personal friend of Mick Young.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the thing that I found most interesting about that day was the great breadth of people who were there. There were people ranging from just ordinary working folk to the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard). Having heard the eulogies delivered by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), by Father Campion and by Mick's son, one could recognise that we were seeing a change in history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After watching Michael at the service a number of members have remarked that it was eerie; that it was really like watching his dad, particularly in the way he stood, the way he held his hands and the way he spoke. For people who had known Mick and seen him around here it was a very eerie thing. I am sure that what others have said, Michael, about you taking on his name will certainly come about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who served with Mick in this place know that he was a person who would always give advice. Sometimes he would give advice that you were not the least interested in hearing. Ros Kelly received some advice from him once about measuring the curtains in his office and she remembered that for a long while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick was always the person who would put out the hand of friendship and he was also a person who could spot talent. I think probably <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="63"> many people were envious about the bond that existed between the current Leader of the Opposition and Mick. They used to go for a walk at lunchtime each day to the lake. Mick used to refer to Mr Beazley as `General'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mick had quite a different life in the Labor movement from Kim Beazley. Mick had a lot of experience to pass on to Kim. I believe that what the member for Burke, Mr Neil O'Keefe, said is not quite right. I think we can see a lot of Mick Youngisms in a lot of the things that Kim did when he was Leader of the House. I think Mick Young was probably the greatest exponent of the role of Leader of the House that any one of us will see. He had that great ability to turn the place around with wit and skill. While he certainly had everybody on our side of the House laughing, the Foreign Minister (Mr Downer) has said that Mick would get people on the other side laughing at some barb as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His barbs were not just for the opposition. Sometimes they were for people on his own side in the chamber. That ability was something that came from Mick's graduation from the university of hard knocks rather than from a normal academic course. I think Mick was the bridge between the old Labor Party and the new Labor Party. The Labor Party as it is today is very much a result of the work that Mick did in the 1970s when he got us to think in the modern way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, while your loss, Mary, and your family's loss is a great one, it is also a loss for us. We will miss him very much. For all of us when we come into the parliament&mdash;particularly those of us who served in the old House&mdash;the ghost of Mick Young will certainly surround the building. We will all miss him greatly. Thank you and your family for giving him to us.</PARA>
