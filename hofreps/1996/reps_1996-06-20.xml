<TIME.STAMP>(9.31 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I entered the Victorian parliament in 1963 and this parliament in 1977, so this, I suspect, unless some kind of revolution takes place, will be my last address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply speech in this House. I begin, sir, by congratulating you and your deputies on your election to the difficult task of presiding over this House, which, from past experience, is not always as orderly as it ought to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we take many things for granted in this nation, and one of the things we take for granted is our system of parliamentary democracy and the Westminster system upon which it is based. We take it for granted that we have had a change in government, that there were no armed police on the streets, there was no military presence, there was an orderly transition of power and we have lots of new faces in the parliament. That does not happen in many parts of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> For my sins, I am a member of the Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Union Committee on Human Rights. There are over 130 parliamentarians in gaol as a result of military actions or takeovers and they are there for no other reason than the fact that they sought to carry out their democrat mandate&mdash;mandates that we take for granted. Therefore, I think it is important on an occasion like this to remem ber that we all have a duty to maintain the integrity of the Westminster system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I must confess to republican sentiments, I have to say that we all owe a debt to the British system we inherited in this place. That involves the concept of a democratically elected parliament and an independent public service&mdash;and I will talk about that later&mdash;but it also involves the separation of powers and an independent judiciary. On those three tiers, basically the whole system of our parliamentary democracy and the rights of our citizens rests.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="COBB" NAMEID="MF4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr Cobb</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They would like that in Burma.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad the honourable gentleman mentioned Burma. It is a perfect example of a takeover by the military, a situation where parliamentarians, democratically elected, have been imprisoned and an arrogant military dictatorship simply refuses to answer the questions that are posed to it by international tribunals as to the fate of those parliamentarians who are languishing in gaol, subject to torture and abuse and separation from their families. These are issues which I think should concern all of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to turn to some questions which, in the cut and thrust of debate, we do not often ask ourselves. There are clearly differences between the philosophy of the incoming government and that of the former government. I am bound to say that I have never been in a parliament when any government has not made mistakes. I say particularly to the newer and younger members of this institution that the role of the parliamentarian, the backbencher, is to try to ensure that, as far as possible, the government he or she supports does not make mistakes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an awe&hyphen;inspiring task and, given the nature of our government process, I think it is true to say, regarding the endeavours that are made from time to time by people who might disagree with government policy, that party discipline in our system is such that it is not always easy to speak out and disapprove of some aspects of policy.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FILING" NAMEID="QT4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr Filing</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is too restrictive.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Therefore, I think it is time we asked ourselves some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pretty important questions. I am concerned about what I believe is the erosion of the Westminster system in state parliaments and in this parliament. The thrust towards privatisation is, I believe, out of kilter and out of balance. I don't believe that there is any overwhelming evidence that privatising an area of government or handing it over to private consultants ultimately does anything more for the government than that which has traditionally been performed by a public service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not an accident in Australia that, despite the crossfire of politics, we have never had a serious allegation  of corruption&mdash;some have resigned because of wrong judgments&mdash;against any Commonwealth minister in carrying out the responsibilities of his portfolio. There have been errors of judgment, yes, but never an allegation of corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not an accident. That comes about because, basically, the pressures on ministers and the range of information and material that they have to deal with comes from a public service which, over years of tradition, has produced a process whereby, by the time the material comes onto the minister's desk, he or she has had an opportunity to make decisions on the best available material. The decision is his or hers. The minister will be argued with by public servants but there are only two kinds of ministers: those who run their public servants and those who are run by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Independence is important. By the time a government contract reaches the minister's desk, it is not possible for him to say, `You'd better take it away because there happens to be a factory in my electorate which I think could do a bit better than this,' or `I have some friends you ought to go and talk to.' It is just not on. Therefore, I am concerned at the thrust of what is taking place in my home state. One of the roles of the Public Service is not just simply to advise the government but to brief the opposition, which they used to do with great skill and discretion. Some matters are properly formulated in government policy which they would not want to discuss. But if either the Leader of the Opposition or a parliamentarian needs advice on some aspect of government policy, he is entitled to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2370"> seek that from a senior public servant. In my introduction to the parliamentary scene in Victoria, that was very much part of the process. There was no difficulty about getting the head of Treasury to speak to opposition members or to a shadow minister&mdash;none at all. It was simply a question of ringing the Premier or the Treasurer and asking and there was never an occasion when that permission was not given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Victoria that system has now changed because the public servant's position is no longer guaranteed. He is now under contract for three years&mdash;not even to his minister but to the Premier. And his salary, of course, has gone up enormously, with very big retirement allowances&mdash;you are looking at millions of dollars. The problem is not necessarily the emolument, which I think is excessive. The problem is that the public servant, as head, can be sacked with three to four weeks notice. That makes the concept of an independent public service a highly questionable exercise indeed. I do not know that those systems which are appropriate to a private company ought necessarily be the systems that apply to government administration. I think the role is clearly different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to look at the social problems that are occurring in many parts of Australia&mdash;not merely unemployment but the rift that is developing between rural Australia and the metropolitan areas. There was a time when no political party, state or federal, could go to the polls without real policies on decentralisation and the moving of resources from the centres out to the bush. In fact, the Whitlam government had a very constructive policy but the only thing, I think, that remains of that now is the Albury&hyphen;Wodonga complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing a cutback in services at many levels to regional towns and cities, and that is a matter of concern. As a parliament, we have to ask ourselves whether banks have a social responsibility or whether they are simply private agencies that set their own policy standards and can say, `It's bad luck for a country town of 800 or 1,000 people but we're going to have to close the bank and the small shopkeeper may have to drive an hour <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and a half to do his normal financial business.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is that an acceptable standard? Does this parliament simply say, `We'll just simply let it run. Banking is not really a question for this House'? The kinds of social infrastructures of regional centres and country towns are being destroyed. That has to be a question that does not affect merely members representing rural constituencies; it affects all of us. Therefore, I believe it is important that more emphasis be given to these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not good enough for banks simply to say, `Our main concern is profit and the bottom line. Running a small bank which services a country town of 800 people or 1,000 people means that the turnover is not great enough. We'll take our banking services out. Within five years they'll all be doing it electronically anyway.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to ask ourselves some serious questions. I do not really care whether the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was bested by the state premiers or he believes he bested them. I think that is irrelevant and, apart from that, the ego of the Treasurer is such that he will never concede the argument anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important, however, that one look at the cutback in services in every state. In my own electorate, one has only to go to the Alfred Hospital to see the cutback in services there and the problems that are facing our health system. Our public transport system is such that if you are getting on a train you need a pretty tight bladder these days because the toilets are closed. Not many families will now allow their daughters to travel on public transport, particularly train services, late at night. Frankly, that is a position which should not be accepted by anybody in a parliamentary institution who realises that there are people who need those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, at a time when our universities ought to be gearing and planning for a fresh intake of young Australians, what has happened? There is not one university in Victoria and, I suspect, every other state, where there are not meetings every day of academic staff to talk not about teaching or intakes but about survival. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2371">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot continue with a situation where the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) can contemplate a level of cuts and we are then told that universities need not plan. If what is being proposed&mdash;and one can only speculate at this stage&mdash;by the minister for education takes root, then you are taking our tertiary system, and the capacity of younger people from poorer families to enter tertiary institutions, back to pre&hyphen;1948. There are many people in this House, there are many people now holding leading positions in Australian society, for no other reason than the fact that the Chifley government in 1948 brought in a scholarship system which opened up our tertiary institutions. There are people in this parliament who are beneficiaries of that. We simply cannot turn our backs on that situation and say that we hope the minister for education will get it right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the same with unemployment. We still have a high rate of unemployment. I believe there is a genuine concern and commitment on the part of all members on both sides of the House that it must be brought down. But you do not bring it down by cutting existing services which are working, and working well. In my electorate&mdash;and, I suspect, in many other electorates&mdash;there are structures which are training younger people and getting them jobs or training them to run small businesses. But the people running those services with very high success rates are now putting everything on hold because they do not know what their funding is going to be. We have to ask ourselves: is this an effective level of management?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am deeply concerned about a view that seems to be emanating from members of the opposition whereby they see an attack on the trade union movement as solving all of Australia's problems. We have seen that development in Great Britain under the Thatcher government, where they confronted an entirely hostile trade union movement. I have heard the argument, and I accept it, that many trade unionists would have voted against the re&hyphen;election of the Keating government. Many unions and many unionists were unhappy about the responsible leadership which tied <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the trade union movement into an accord. We had a period of industrial peace. Union members found that their entitlements were restricted while they saw company profits going through the roof.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trade union movement has been the subject of unreasoned attack in this House. Nobody will argue that the trade union movement or business corporations are perfect; they are not. We know, for example, that in my electorate, and in every metropolitan electorate in Melbourne that has any industrial base, the Clothing Trade Union, due to lack of resources, has never been able to deal effectively with the problems of backyard and illegal outwork. There are migrant women being grossly exploited and underpaid by private contractors who then take the garment and compete with legitimate small businessmen running properly based manufacturing industry. They are having to compete with these backyarders. That is not just a problem for the trade union movement; that is a problem for government. Do we believe that there is social progress involved in that gross exploitation of women and children?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, I find it extraordinary that while there is this emphasis on privatisation, in my own state we are talking about privatising levels of public administration while the mates of the Premier are given a private monopoly to run a casino. I do not have any problem with casinos per se. Personally, I would like to see two or three smaller, boutique style casinos like you see in Europe. I would have no problem with them also being in Mildura, Bendigo or Ballarat. But I find it extraordinary that, without any kind of research into its social impact, we have this ever increasing structure which has a private monopoly. So it is monopolies for mates on the one hand but privatisation of public assets on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find that very difficult to understand from a state administration which says, `We believe in competition and we believe in private enterprise.' I think it is time that we talked about this because Australia is part of a capitalist system. I do not think that is going to change. So is America and so is Japan. Each of those systems is constrained in many <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2372"> ways by their culture and religious tradition. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, may I extend to you and to your deputies my congratulations on your election to the most esteemed position in this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To take a first step in the Commonwealth parliament is one of inspiration and, faced with the daunting size and magnitude of the occasion, and with the support of the people of Petrie, family and friends, I stand here determined and prepared for whatever challenges might lie ahead. I take my seat in this chamber with no foreseen expectations. I have the strong belief in the mandate to be a true representative and to give clear voice in the decision making of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My first speech marks more than one achievement. I am the first female to represent the seat of Petrie, the first female of Australian&hyphen;Italian origin to take a seat in the House, and it is indeed a privilege to take a seat in the first Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to take this opportunity to thank those from all walks of life who have been important in my journey to this present position. In particular, I wish to make mention of the contributions by the Liberal Party team, at both a state and a federal level, and the tireless efforts of my campaign director, Bill Lunney. His dedication and persistence in achieving the goal of success at the federal election were enormous contributions to ensuring my seat here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish also to thank Terry Barlow for his support and years of dedication and service and his wife Lois for the hundreds of cups of tea she made. I wish to thank Anne Hobbs, who joined me in door knocking the electorate, and Geoff Green, who kept my finances in order throughout the campaign. Thank you also to branch members across the electorate for their tremendous efforts and support. I wish to thank the many people in the local <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> business community who supported me, particularly Ralph De Pasquale, Hank and Mary Van Lieshout, Kevin Driscoll and Bob Turner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to acknowledge the support and assistance given to me by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard); the Treasurer (Mr Costello); and my mentor, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). Many thanks also to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), Senator Macdonald and Senator MacGibbon, as well as local state member John Goss. Thank you also to the state Minister for Training and Industrial Relations, the Hon. Santo Santoro, for his assistance, guidance and fundraising assistance, and to the former state member for Redcliffe, Terry White.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be remiss of me not to make particular mention of the contribution and guidance of a former representative of the people of Petrie, the Hon. John Hodges, and his wonderful wife, Margaret. He is a man of true integrity and a gentleman. He held the seat of Petrie from 1974 to 1983 and from 1984 to 1987. He was the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and made a significant contribution to the House during his time in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seat of Petrie stretches from the Moreton Bay shaped edges of Deception Bay and the Redcliffe Peninsula in the north to the residential suburbs of Chermside, Carseldine and McDowall in the south. The electorate includes some of the fastest growing regions in south-east Queensland&mdash;namely, Fitzgibbon, Deception Bay and, more recently, Mango Hill. The Petrie electorate is dominated by social and industrial issues. There is a reliance on the efficiency of social security, support for local small business and an emphasis on cost effective transport corridors and education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electorate includes Queensland's major specialist cardio&hyphen;thoracic hospital, Prince Charles Hospital, which services Queensland, New South Wales, Northern Territory, Papua <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2373"> New Guinea and the Pacific Rim. The hospital houses Queensland's only heart transplant unit, which has performed some 129 operations since 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Local government issues and agendas are high in the Petrie electorate and four councils feature&mdash;Brisbane city, Redcliffe city, Pine Rivers shire and the Caboolture shire. All four are extremely active with development plans and growth management. The importance of local council contributions to the community can never be underestimated and the services that they provide should always be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The city of Redcliffe, on a peninsula of just 35 square kilometres, supports a thriving fishing industry and a variety of light industry and is a favourite spot for picnics and weekend angling. The fishing industry is important to the local area with Moreton Bay being the feeding ground for sand and mud crabs, fish and prawns. The fact that one of the largest expenditures for the industry is fuel, oil and gas ensures my particular interest in the diesel fuel rebate scheme and its impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be remembered that it is not just farmers who are affected by rain. The fishing industry is also reliant on rain, and seasonal conditions can determine a year's economic stability. However, the fishing industry in Petrie cannot just be classified under the banner of catching and trawling. It covers a wide chain of economic activity, encompassing processing, transporting, wholesaling and retailing. The planning of transport infrastructure is important to the continued development of the local area and, in particular, public transport facilities and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pine Rivers is another shire on the move and it adjoins the electorate of the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith). The population of the shire has increased dramatically and, according to the shire's annual report, building applications worth $184.5 million were processed last financial year. Caboolture shire, as the member for Longman (Mr Brough) would be aware, is growing and considering all options to provide cultural, recreation and social services to residents. A decision to build a community recreation centre at Deception Bay was finalised only last week, giving <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> residents of the area a focus for both recreational and social pursuits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seat of Petrie was named after builder and architect Andrew Petrie. An achiever, Petrie has the distinction of being the first white man to climb Mount Beerwah, one of the Glasshouse Mountains in the Sunshine Coast hinterland. On his death in 1872 he left an enormous legacy. His eldest son, John, became the first lord mayor of Brisbane and his second son, Thomas, studied Aboriginal tribes, their customs and languages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with Andrew Petrie that I feel I can draw some similarity. I spent my formative years living in Petrie Terrace and went to school at All Hallows', which houses the historical building of Adderton built by Andrew and John Petrie in the 1850s. The Petries then went on to play a significant role in the construction of Queensland's Parliament House, the general post office and the port office building. My association with Petrie flows through my childhood, my schooling years and now will continue throughout my political life. The spirit of Petrie lives on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I looked back into the history of Italians in this country, I found their contributions were significant in  Australia's development. After 1947, the demographic pressures in Italy, the industrial expansion of Australia and the restrictive immigration policies adopted by the United States favoured mass immigration to Australia. Within the next 20 years the Australian&hyphen;Italian community became the second largest community, after the British, in Australia. A common element to which I can relate is the strong social and cultural life within the Italian community. The focus on the family is strong, and support and guidance forever lasting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to this parliament with a community and business background, having worked extensively in the retail, tourism, personnel and franchising industries. The road to this House was never an easy one and I had to weigh up my business commitments and my work as a tutor in the marketing department of the Queensland University of Technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to thank my academic colleagues. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at QUT. I would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2374"> like to make mention of Cathy Neal, Nancy Fredericks, Dr Chad Perry, Su Mon Wong, Catherine Rankin, Evan Price, Max Briggs, Dr Jim Kable, an academic mentor from way back, and all the wonderful staff in the marketing department. Thank you for your support and your encouragement over a very long&mdash;16-month&mdash;campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was delighted to achieve a swing of 12.59 per cent in Petrie. Su Mon Wong, your words stay with me always: marketing is giving people what they want. The reason the coalition won by such an overwhelming majority is that we listened to people and their needs and we gave Australians what they wanted. As social analyst Hugh Mackay has said, people are more likely to listen to us if we listen to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During a recent visit to Humpybong state primary school children of ages eight to 12 told me their view of politicians. Two significant responses from these valuable members of our community were that politicians argue and call each other names. Children can be very brutally honest and first impressions can taint you for life. I applaud this government's move to bring honour and dignity back to the parliamentary stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to see so many females on this side of the chamber and, in essence, to see the influx of females standing for federal parliament. Currently over 78 per cent of the females in this parliament belong to the coalition. I am proud to be one of the new women in parliament and hope to realise the expectations and ideals which have been placed upon us. I believe Australia will one day have a female Prime Minister. The support and role of responsibilities given to women and members will ensure that this `one day' will be a reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the past 15 years of my working life I have come to realise that as we go through various stages of our life cycle our work needs change. A more flexible workplace is what is needed, job sharing and more worker friendly practices. My time in the personnel industry showed me the huge demand for good quality part-time work. Whenever we advertised these positions our phone would run hot and the mailman would  deliver our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mail not by hand but by the bagful. This is one of the reasons why women are setting up business at three times the rate of men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Flexibility and control of one's environment are what real quality of life is all about. I welcome the new workplace reforms and their effects on the flexibility of the work system. The award system under the workplace reforms can only benefit employers and employees. If Australia modernises its industrial environment, the rights of women in the workplace must be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Businesses have much to gain from introducing work practices that reflect the family needs of employees. Some benefits automatically include increased productivity, increased work morale, retention of high quality staff, reduction in staff turnover and absenteeism, reduction in stress and a more harmonious workplace. I wish to acknowledge the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) for his contribution in the area of work and technological change. In his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sleepers, Wake!</EMPHASIS> he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Western world is passing through a period of technological change, more far-reaching&mdash;and much faster&mdash;than at any other time.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many people feel reluctant to face up to the issues and would prefer to put off thinking about them, in the hope that either the problems will go away or prove to be exaggerated, or someone else might solve them.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a bias today towards the expansion of information systems rather than engineering and related skills. Australian management needs to be more outward looking if we are to embrace this technology and increase our competitiveness overseas. Businesses must carefully consider the concept of combining recruitment and placement of permanent and part-time employees with outsourcing for productivity and performance enhancement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign I made a significant effort to visit the small business sector in the Petrie electorate. In the months leading up to the election I visited some 2,000 small businesses in Aspley, McDowall, Bracken Ridge, Redcliffe, Deception Bay and Rothwell. I listened to their concerns and the hardships they face. Small business is the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2375"> heart and soul of many families. It is a livelihood, an employment mecca and a strong branch of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The areas of concern are nothing new&mdash;labour on-costs, the strength of big business, bureaucratic red tape, government intervention and an employer unfriendly industrial relations environment, especially the unfair dismissal clauses. These have caused hardship not only to the businesses and the people of Petrie but throughout Australia. Many of these areas of concern were once again highlighted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> small business index report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact that small business owners are lacking the confidence and encouragement to employ new staff, especially young people. Instead they are either cutting staff and operating hours or working longer hours themselves. Small business, as the nucleus of the Australian economy, is the single greatest generating source of jobs and opportunities in our economy. We must reward business owners and operators for their hard work, not punish them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The double digit figure of unemployed people between the ages of 15 and 19 living in the electorate is a further source of concern to me. Father John McKeown, a Catholic priest in Redcliffe City and a broadcaster on a metropolitan radio station, has stated that employment is one of the key components that make a city livable. We must not forget our youth, their dreams, their ambitions and their self-esteem. Bert Weir, a personal friend and teacher of mental strength to the staff of businesses and government organisations all over Australia, in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">What happened?</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kindness, generosity, ability to cooperate, inquisitiveness, confidence, sense of humour, creativity and calmness are only some of the . . . important qualities of human worth. How often are these praised? For a child to have a strong, balanced sense of self-esteem, it must be anchored in many different aspects of human beauty and worth.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>One must not forget our more senior citizens. Australia is an ageing population. It is estimated that the average number of people aged 65 and older will grow at twice the rate of the total population from now until 2011 and three times this rate thereafter. With an ageing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> population Australia faces a major challenge now and in the years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I had the pleasure of meeting a wonderful psychologist and philosopher recently, Dr Hilda des Artes. We discussed the housing of the aged. She spoke of a wonderful vision where single people, families and the aged could live in harmony. Young people could balance intellectual expansion with the experiences of the older members. Her vision was not to isolate people but to resurrect community based values on the extended family concept, therefore ensuring that the experience and memories of the elders are appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a government I believe we need to market ourselves. A lack of information can cause problems. The technology is available to inform and educate constituents, and we must continue to utilise these options. By being steadfast in its approach, I am sure that this government will provide for the demand of services required for the people of Petrie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I come from a working background. My grandfather, Giovanbaptista Gambaro, at 17 years of age, in 1905, worked in the Pennsylvanian coal mines. It was hard, arduous work digging coal by shovel. In 1915 war started, and he returned to Italy and joined the Italian army voluntarily. While a soldier of the allied forces, he was captured, became a prisoner of war and was put to work in a sugar factory in Czechoslovakia for four years. This was the first time he was to be a prisoner of war. Meanwhile, back in Italy, my grandmother ran a tobacconist shop and raised six children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1938 Giovanbaptista came to Australia and worked in North Queensland managing a farm. Sadly, with the arrival of 1940, he was to experience his second stint as a prisoner of war when he was transported to South Australia as a civilian POW. He spent four years as a prisoner of the Australian government. Mr Deputy Speaker, this was an unnecessary and regrettable period in Australia's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My father, Dominic, arrived in Australia in 1944. Working in North Queensland, he raised the money to buy a retail fish store in Petrie Terrace where he worked with my grandfather. In 1950 my grandmother and my <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2376"> Uncle Michael came to Australia and also worked in the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My family's business is now one of Australia's best known seafood restaurants. We have a thriving wholesale business and seafood processing facility and export plant, and we export to Asia and the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to thank my parents, Dominic and Rosetta, for exposing me to the wonderful experiences of my youth. As a student they encouraged me to work in the business and, as I peered over my economics books, I observed the rich spectacle and the passing parade of clients in the restaurant. They came from all walks of life and from all countries to dine on Queensland's finest seafood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank my parents for all they have taught me&mdash;my father, Dominic, for his determination, single-mindedness, perseverance and, dare I say it, relentlessness. Many of his qualities have been passed on to me, though at times he probably wished they had not. Thank you for your love and support during my campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My mother has been the driving force in my life. Not only did she raise four children but also she worked seven days a week for many years to ensure that we had economic stability. Her kindness to others is legendary. I am proud to be the daughter of Rosetta Gambaro and will admire her always. The love and kindness she gives to others will live on forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my brother John: thank you for the wonderful letterbox delivery and folding skills. I wish you success in your further career path and admire you for the courage of your convictions. My sister Elisa, the philosopher and intellectual of the family and her husband Glen: thank you for the encouragement and strength you gave me during the campaign. My baby sister Ida and Robert: welcome home, we missed you. But Robert, the space program is far richer for your research and work in Germany over the past three years. Ida, I have missed your black and white approach to life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my own family: thank you, Chris, for your assistance. To my children, Rachelle and Benjamin: you are the most precious things in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> my life; thank you for the joy you bring to me each day. My two children have influenced my life, and I intend to make a contribution which will lay the foundation for their future lives in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to acknowledge Ugo Sirianni and Josie and the whole Sirianni family for encouraging me to go into politics. Your strength and faith in me never faltered. Michael and Josie Gambaro and family: thank you for your support. To all my friends and fellow Rotarians, many of whom are listening: thank you for your help and involvement in my life and my campaign.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, let me congratulate the honourable member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) on her fine first speech in this parliament. Indeed, may I congratulate the many others who have already made first speeches and those who will be making first speeches. They have been very interesting first speeches and of a very high quality on both sides. I only hope that the enthusiasm and idealistic views those new members have brought into this parliament will be maintained and stay with them during the years they are here, as that enthusiasm and vigour sometimes dim a little after you have been here a few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party lost the 2 March election for a number of reasons, not the least because of its time factor but more significantly because the new government made many promises and commitments that it knows it cannot fulfil. In that election the candidates for the conservative parties had a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2377"> dream run: they could promise anything and ask the people to take them on trust. Candidates like me, members of the then governing party&mdash;indeed, a party that had been in government for 13 years&mdash;had to defend constantly the previous government's policies. Some of us must have got it right. I was one of the few on this side who actually had a swing towards me; in fact, my primary vote increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you a couple of examples. For example, the current member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) spent much of her campaigning on New South Wales government issues, not least on roads and on the question of the Minnamurra bends. The member for Gilmore, who I see is in the chamber, also made comments saying that youth unemployment would not be tolerated. Yet the policies of this current government, of which she is a member, will not reduce unemployment generally. I suggest that the Minnamurra bends will be just as congested in three years time as they are today. I also make the point that had the truth been told about the plans for Holsworthy airport Robert Tickner would still be the member for Hughes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The expectations the Australian people have for the Australian Labor Party always amaze me. Whatever the interest group is, they always expect the world from the Australian Labor Party, but they expect nothing from the conservatives. Australians always raise the high bar with the Australian Labor Party but never with the conservatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conservation movement is a good example. I will defend the Australian Labor Party's stand on the conservation issue. With the conservation movement it always seems to me that they ask the conservatives for nothing because they know that they will get nothing from the conservatives. When they get nothing, consequently they are not disappointed. With the Labor Party, when they expect the world or 100 per cent and we deliver 90 per cent of their perceived expectation, they turn on us with the vengeance of a spurned lover for not delivering the next 10 per cent of often unrealistic expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrast this with the conservatives. The interest groups expect nothing from them, ask <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them for nothing and seem not to be disappointed when they receive nothing. From Labor they want the 100 per cent bargain and when they receive 90 per cent, they decide to punish us, even if in doing so they punish themselves. Many punished themselves by their vote during the last election. Some are now starting to realise this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my speech some time ago addressing the Supply Bill, I gave a gentle but legitimate touch&hyphen;up to the Wollongong University branch of the National Tertiary Education Union and particularly its untrustworthy or treacherous president, Michael Morrissey, for punishing themselves. Because of the cuts of this government to the University of Wollongong, the Illawarra region is going to lose $50 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The universities around the country are screaming because of the hurt that is being inflicted on them. Yet many of these universities and the academics campaigned against the Australian Labor Party. They campaigned for the government that is now in power. I will support the blue&hyphen;collar workers in the universities and the universities in general, but I find it awfully hard to get enthusiastic for some of the academics when in the Illawarra they campaigned against the Labor Party. They doorknocked the seat of Gilmore; they letterboxed it and the seat of Hughes. They took ads in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS>&mdash;`Put Labor last'. I have had enough with the universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a different target today. It is the Dapto Medicare Action Committee. During the campaign, the Liberal candidate for Throsby, one Dr Albert Galea of chicken fame, landed himself in my electorate like a breeze or a chicken from Sydney to announce in one day's campaigning in Throsby for the entire election that he would deliver a Medicare office to Dapto. This was the only commitment the Liberal candidate for Throsby gave during the entire election campaign. Dr Galea spent one day during a month&hyphen;long campaign in my electorate, travelling from Sydney, to deliver one sole promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This illustrates my point about expectations from Labor and the conservatives. The campaign to establish a Medicare office in Dapto <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2378"> has been around for many years. There has been, and still is, considerable support within the Dapto community to establish a Medicare office. The campaign was mounted by the Dapto Senior Citizens and support has been expressed by numerous Dapto community groups and individuals and through meetings which have taken place with me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I gave my total support to this campaign from the beginning. I attended and arranged meetings with officials from the Health Insurance Commission; I arranged for deputations from the Dapto Medicare Action Committee to call on the ministers responsible for health in the previous government. I made numerous representations seeking information to advance a campaign and offered my office facilities to the committee to produce and distribute pamphlets, petitions, leaflets and letters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 28 November last year, a journalist from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS> contacted me in Canberra and said he had just met with the Dapto Medicare Action Committee, who had accused me of betraying their campaign. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Dapto Medicare Action Committee, which has been striving for more than two years to have a Medicare Office re&hyphen;opened in Dapto, said yesterday it was upset with a statement Mr Hollis made on WIN TV at the end of a public meeting last week. The Federal Member for Throsby said that should Dapto get a Medicare Office, there would be four Medicare Offices in close proximity; other offices are in Wollongong, Warrawong and Shellharbour. The DMAC has interpreted Mr Hollis' comments as a suggestion that he did not support the group's goals . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The three committee members did not even bother to check with me what I said on WIN TV following the public meeting. They took their interpretation and their remarks straight to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS> , which gave them a cheap headline and a photograph in the newspaper, but did absolutely zero for their goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have three volumes of files in my office, which I invite people to examine for themselves, so they can draw their own conclusions as to my efforts and my support to establish a Medicare office. I have no doubt that the three committee members who were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so critical of me were part of the 18 per cent of the voters in Throsby who did not vote for me when they went into the polling booth in Dapto to cast their vote for the Liberal candidate for Throsby in the vain hope that a Medicare office would be established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Dapto were lied to by the Liberal candidate for Throsby during the last election. The Liberals had no intention of establishing a Medicare office in Dapto. I can see the huddle now on the footpath outside the Dapto Post Office: the Liberal candidate and his campaign strategists, on the only day of a fleeting visit to the electorate, thinking up a promise to garner some votes for the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While people can be critical of me and my stand on some issues, one accusation that can never be made against me is that I lied to the people in Throsby. I have never promised something I could not deliver. I have always supported a cause. I have always explained the difficulties. But I have never lied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my 13 years as a member of parliament I have been involved in many campaigns, but none have been distorted or my role so wilfully misreported as in the case of the Dapto Medicare office establishment. As I have said, Dapto needs a Medicare office, mainly because of the extensive population growth which is being experienced in new residential developments like the Horsley Estate at west Dapto. I have always seen this as the key to the establishment of a Medicare office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the election of the conservatives to office and their demonstrated need to take the axe to the public sector, not only will Dapto not get a Medicare office but I have seen documents which indicate that one of the existing four Medicare offices in the Illawarra is earmarked for closure. I suggest that it will be the Shellharbour office. Under this new government, the people of Australia will face a tidal wave of public sector cuts. Every department and agency will have a date with the axe. The Illawarra, as usual, has been the first region to cop these cuts in the neck. So much for the claims of the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) that, as the only Illawarra based member on the federal government, he <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2379"> would pay close attention to the region. He is paying close attention; the kind of attention he gave the region when he was the Premier of New South Wales. While Premier he was tagged `closed shop John', as he gutted the New South Wales public sector, particularly the Department of Community Services. As finance minister, he is living up to the tag in his latest reincarnation. The closure of the Shellharbour Medicare office, the Wollongong office of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the closure of the Family Court facilities in the Illawarra and the customs services at Port Kembla are the first of many instalments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conservatives do not have a mandate to attack the public sector in the Illawarra. The community, trade unions, public sector organisations and Labor politicians will fight every move to close these important service delivery agencies. We will all be involved in any community, political and industrial campaign to ensure that these decisions are reversed and these important services retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already had meetings with representatives from the Illawarra Migrant Resource Centre, the Illawarra Ethnic Communities Council, the South Coast Labour Council, the Community and Public Sector Union, and ethnic communities based in the Illawarra to discuss the planned cuts. In regard to the closure of the office of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the people of the Illawarra are going to be particularly disadvantaged. I contact the office frequently&mdash;on average, four or five times a week&mdash;regarding a range of issues, most of them of an extremely complex and involved nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is almost unbelievable that this government could even think about closing this immigration office in Wollongong, one of the most ethnically diverse centres of Australia. Now, instead of going into Burelli Street in Wollongong, people will have to make a trip of 80 kilometres into Rockdale in Sydney to do all their dealings with this office. The announcement shows the distain that the coalition government has for ethnic Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is rapidly acquiring the title of the fastest promise <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> breaker in Australian political history, which will no doubt earn him a special entry into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guinness Book of Records</EMPHASIS>. So much for the Honest John image!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question has to be asked at one stage or another: how much more of this can Australians take? How much more can be cut? How much more can be downsized? How many more people can we add to the unemployment queues? How much more can be done with less? How many more advisers and commentators do we have to listen to whose only contribution is made up of three words: cut, cut, cut? The government has a counting paperclip mentality. It has this need to be seen imitating Thatcher's Britain or Gingrich's United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor left the economy in good shape. We are in the fourth year of continual economic growth. The indicators all point to healthy economic conditions. The share market is at record level, consumer confidence is up, we have a broken drought, community prices are at a high, company profits are up 7.7 per cent in the latest quarter, and inflation remains slow. Australia already has a small public sector by international standards. Only Japan and the United States spend less on their own public sectors. Australia is already the third lowest taxed major industrialised country in the world. The public sector is already efficient and productive. There is no fat left to trim from the bone. The government, with these substantial cuts, will be cutting into the muscle which holds the public sector together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This week the government is debating the industrial relations legislation package. Although the standing orders prevent me from addressing some of these provisions, I do want to make some comments about the trade union movement. It has always been fashionable to blindly attack the Australian trade union movement and blame workers for every real or imagined industrial relations problem. It has always been very easy and sometimes very convenient to make unions into scapegoats. Frequently such attacks are without foundation, they ignore the reality of the situation and present one view of a  conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not claim that in each and every dispute the union is always right but certainly, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2380"> contrary to the view which the government holds, the trade union movement, especially in the Illawarra, is largely made up of responsible members and officials who care about not only their wages and conditions but also the state of the economy and the wellbeing of all Australians, particularly the disadvantaged and the battlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trade union movement in the Illawarra, under the leadership of the South Coast Labour Council, has had a long tradition of being active in a whole range of worker related issues that extend well beyond the customary role of seeking better wages and conditions. It is most certainly my experience in the Illawarra region, given my close working relationship with the trade union movement, that the officials and members are prepared to negotiate before considering industrial action. They see strike action as a last resort to be used only when all other courses of action have been exhausted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unions in the Illawarra have been credited with taking a leadership role in initiatives to seek the development of structures and approaches which, on the one hand, will facilitate better working and management communications and shared decision making and, on the other hand, reduce industrial disputation. However, they are certainly not prepared to sacrifice hard won wages and conditions without getting some tangible results. The Illawarra has a strong tradition of workers standing up for their rights. It is only the most prejudiced people who cannot or will not distinguish between what they see as pigheadedness and legitimate trade union militancy. The history of the trade union struggle is one of a long and hard fight to achieve the wages and conditions which Australian workers enjoy today. However, the Illawarra unions understand that the price of maintaining decent wages and conditions is that one must be eternally vigilant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Illawarra unionists have changed with the times. They have recognised that we live in different economic circumstances than in the boom of the fifties and the sixties. They know that they have to respond to changing conditions and, in fact, they have led that change. The labour movement in my area leads the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community. We have the best interests of our region and the people in it at heart at all times. Those of us who have a background in the trade union movement will not stand back and see this government's ideological agenda simply slip into place. We will be legitimately militant with no apology&mdash;no apology at all. Some in the community, in order to punish Labor, have now set themselves up to be punished. But, as usual, the political and industrial wings of the labour movement will once again meet the expectations always placed on us to ensure that they are not left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the beginning of my speech I paid sincere compliments to the many people who are making their first speeches. One element comes across constantly, though, and that is the bogey of the trade union movement. Not everyone in the Illawarra is a member of a trade union, but people often come to me and say that they have been sacked. Two young people have been sacked from a company called Death by Chocolate. UFI Pools have gone into bankruptcy. There are a lot of situations where workers are sacked or stood down and do not get their conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two weeks ago I had the case of a boatbuilder who came in and told me that he had not been paid for six months. I said, `What does your union say?' `No, we're not members of the union,' he said. No&hyphen;one realises the importance of the trade union movement until they need it. We hear about compulsory unionism. We hear all these things about unionism. That is fine if the bosses are the understanding, advanced people that so many on the other side think they are. But, unfortunately, my experience over many years&mdash;not only in the trade union movement but also in this parliament&mdash;indicates to me that the bosses are not like this. People do not realise just how important the trade union movement and their membership of a trade union is until they need it, and then it is often too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be wonderful if the bosses were as caring and concerned for the wellbeing of their workers as some on the other side indicate. It always seems to me that the only thing the boss ever cares about is the bulge in his pocket. That bulge may be responsible for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2381"> many things, but it is usually the money that he is making by putting harsh conditions on the workers.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past few weeks some 38 new members have risen to deliver their maiden speeches. I would like to begin by acknowledging the quality of so many of these members on both sides of the House. In their first offerings, many have enthusiastically sung the praises of their own electorates&mdash;a perfectly understandable sentiment&mdash;but, with respect, I say to the honourable members that until you visit Macquarie you have not seen anything!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the uninitiated, a brief geography lesson. Macquarie covers about 4,000 square kilometres extending north&hyphen;south in a band about an hour's drive west of Sydney. It covers some of the most breathtaking scenery in the country: the rugged and spectacular Blue Mountains, including the Three Sisters, the Jamison and Megalong Valleys and the untouched Wollemi, Kanangra&hyphen;Boyd and Blue Mountains national parks&mdash;some of which I soon hope to see achieve world heritage listing. It includes the mighty and majestic Hawkesbury River with its fertile flood plains, and it includes the tranquil beauty of the Kurrajong Hills and the spectacular Grose Valley and Colo River.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is Macquarie abundantly endowed with physical beauty, not only is it a unique <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tourist attraction, but also it is an area steeped in history. The region was settled initially by several indigenous tribes, particularly the Gundungurra and other Dharug speakers. More recently, European history in the region dates back almost to the First Fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hawkesbury was settled from 1794, and the towns of Richmond, Wilberforce, Windsor, Pitt Town and Castlereagh were selected in 1810 by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. In the Blue Mountains, the trail&hyphen;blazing exploits in 1813 by Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth across the Blue Mountains have left their mark on the string of settlements which basically follow the route trod by those early pioneers. I would like to focus briefly on three of the most significant political figures associated with the area I represent because I feel that each of them has something to teach us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is Governor Lachlan Macquarie&mdash;obviously from a time well before the seat was created but the one from whom it derives its name. Macquarie, whose epitaph calls him the `Father of Australia', was a man of vision, determined to push the frontiers and extend our horizons. His establishment of new towns, his commissioning of the crossing of the Blue Mountains and his encouragement of early exploration all mark him as someone who was not willing to accept the status quo. But he was also a pragmatist. His energetic program of public works and development of infrastructure, his concerns to tackle Sydney's water pollution problems and his determination to use the Hawkesbury Valley to supply Sydney's agricultural needs all show his practical and down&hyphen;to&hyphen;earth approach to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Macquarie was also a humanitarian. His establishment of public schools, his attempts to lift the moral standards of society in order to protect family life, his attempts at humanitarian reconciliation with the indigenous people and his well&hyphen;known program of emancipation all point to a man committed to social justice. In fact, his obituary in the gazette of the time said of him rather succinctly: `To serve mankind was his delight.' A challenge for any of us in public life.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2382">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second key figure whose link with the electorate is perhaps not so well known is Sir Henry Parkes. Parkes, the `Father of Federation', at times lived in the Blue Mountains and, in fact, lies buried there in a grave at Faulconbridge&mdash;a town named after his mother's family name. In fact, earlier this year we commemorated at Faulconbridge the centenary of his death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message from Sir Henry Parkes is, to use his own words, `The crimson thread of kinship runs through us all.' In his battle to bring together six separate struggling colonies into one great nation, Parkes concentrated on the things that unite us rather than the things that divide us. He was driven by the vision of nationhood that can be achieved only when we allow our differences to be swallowed up in the things that we share. The challenge here for us is to put aside our differences of background, race, religion and ideology, and focus on our common aspirations and the good of those we represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third great figure of history associated with the electorate of Macquarie is the former Prime Minister Ben Chifley who held the seat from 1928 to 1931 and then from 1940 until his death in 1951. What Ben Chifley brought to Australia was a determination to rebuild the country after the devastation of war. It involved a commitment to providing a reasonable standard of living for all. In his view, this required sound economic management and the eradication of unemployment. He rightly saw employment not only as a necessary ingredient for economic wellbeing but also as a vital component in an individual's self&hyphen;respect. These issues, I believe, are still paramount if we are to achieve economic and social justice in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn briefly to more recent history, as recent in fact as 2 March this year. Like so many of the new members, I stand in this parliament because of the events on that day or, more accurately, because of a string of forces leading up to and culminating at the ballot box on 2 March. In my electorate of Macquarie over 4,600 voters changed their minds since the previous election. The obvious questions are: who and why? If I knew <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who, I would shake each of their hands individually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are questions, however, worth pursuing, not for the sake of raking over the coals or rubbing in the salt, as tempting as that might be, but because it enables us to focus better on the needs of those we serve. It is possible that those voters included some of the 3,500 registered unemployed in the electorate, many of whom had been out of work for over a year or the thousands more hidden unemployed, people tired of endless training programs, job queues and frustrated hopes. It probably included some of the hundreds of low income earners I met during the campaign who felt cheated by the fact that they worked 40 or 50 hours a week and, after doing so, were no better off than others they knew on welfare. It possibly included some of the 13,500 home buyers in the electorate worried about the mortgages hanging over their heads and battling the effects of the previous government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps it included some of the 3,000 defence personnel at RAAF Base Richmond who were disillusioned and demoralised at the ongoing battering and neglect of Australia's defence forces, or some of the hundreds of independent retirees throughout the electorate incensed at the discrimination they feel at being penalised rather than rewarded for having saved for their own retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps it included many of the frail aged and their families despairing at the severe shortage of nursing home beds in the electorate, a mere 877, with virtually every nursing home having an enormous unmet waiting list. It probably included most of the 4,000&hyphen;odd small businesses in the electorate sick of being slugged every time they turn around, fed up with the endless pile of paperwork, red tape, taxes and the ultimate humiliation of Labor's ridiculous unfair dismissal laws&mdash;and then being told, `This is as good as it gets.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It probably included many friends of the environment appalled at the degradation of the Blue Mountains streams and the Hawkesbury&hyphen;Nepean river system, and wanting to see action. I daresay it included ordinary men and women from all sections of the community <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2383"> concerned at the direction of the country, sick of paying rising taxes to see no real benefit, sick of playing second fiddle to sectional interests, alarmed at the decline of our health system, confused over what seemed to be anti&hyphen;family policies and anxious about the growing legacy of debt left to our children. There are no doubt many other reasons as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that over 4,500 Macquarie voters changed is the reason I am here today and the fact that over half a million voters nationwide did the same thing is the reason I stand on this side of the House with so many fine colleagues. Yet this places an enormous responsibility on the government and brings with it some great challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first challenge is the need to restore responsible economic management. The head&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;sand approach of the previous government, graduates from the ostrich school of economics, has been a disaster that has left us with a net foreign debt which increased from $23 billion to $180 billion in the last 13 years and total net foreign liabilities of $270 billion, involving the sale of many of our national icons; a current account deficit dangerously close to six per cent of GDP; and Commonwealth public sector debt which has blown out from $32 billion to $97 billion in the last five years&mdash;up from 10 per cent of GDP to 20 per cent of GDP in that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Real interest rates are amongst the highest in the industrialised world and unemployment is stuck at around 8.5 per cent of GDP, with youth unemployment at a tragic 27 per cent. Possibly there are up to another million hidden unemployed or underemployed who have either given up looking for work or have settled for part&hyphen;time work. We have a GDP per capita which has fallen from 10th in the world in 1983 to 22nd now, with increasing inequality in income distribution and increasing levels of poverty in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tackling these issues demands enormous vision and commitment. Amongst other things it requires policies to lift the level of national savings. In addition to correcting the public sector savings problems it also means raising the household savings ratio, which has fallen from seven per cent of GDP to less than one <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent in the last decade. It requires an honest review of our taxation system and an overhaul of the industrial relations system, with a view to providing real labour market flexibility and enhancing productivity, results which I am sure will flow from our recently tabled workplace relations bill. It requires a determination to hasten the pace of micro-economic reform, raise productivity and lift our international competitiveness from its appalling 21st place in the world. It requires policies designed to promote incentives in this country&mdash;incentive to work, incentive to invest, incentive to save, incentive to innovate, incentive to take risks and incentives to be independent. We must reward those who are willing to have a go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second challenge is to restore the fundamental place of the family in our community. Strong family units are central to a healthy society&mdash;central in providing a secure upbringing for our children and a sense of worth for our emerging young people, central in fostering patterns of care, love and respect in human relationships, central in providing a place of help and strength in an often hostile world, central in providing a real welfare net in times of material hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, families are under increasing pressure&mdash;pressure from policies which have often assisted sectional interests and ignored their impact on the family; financial pressures in the form of increased taxes, higher interest rates and unemployment have often been the last straw for struggling families; pressure from the media, which has glorified lifestyles which are destructive to the family unit; and pressures from a range of philosophies which undermine the intrinsic worth of the individual. To counter some of these forces is nigh on impossible, but to start where we can is absolutely crucial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third challenge for us is to restore public confidence in the political processes of this country. Over the past few years, the public have understandably become increasingly cynical, witnesses to a degeneration of many of the conventions and practices of government; to declining standards of parliamentary behaviour; to governments which have come to treat the truth as a disposable <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2384"> commodity, trotted out when politically convenient and discarded just as easily; to governments which have treated parliament with contempt; and to governments of arrogance out of touch with the needs and aspirations of ordinary Australians. I believe that we have an enormous responsibility to restore the trust and confidence of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth challenge for us is to restore balance. For too long we have seen policy decisions driven by ideological excess or acquiescence to powerful interest groups. We need to restore balance between idealism and pragmatism&mdash;to be driven by our ideals but to understand that they must work in the real world&mdash;balance between equity and efficiency so that we seek a fair distribution of income but not in a way that reduces incentive and productivity and ultimately lowers the living standards of all; balance between dependence and independence so that our welfare net provides genuine security for those who need it but does not discourage the struggle for self&hyphen;sufficiency; balance between individualism and community so that our collective commitments flow from individual freedom, not from regulation or coercion; balance between rights and responsibilities so that what we expect from society is more than matched by what we desire to contribute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to be part of a government which, I am sure, will rise to these challenges, a government which will earnestly tackle our economic problems, a government which will protect and strengthen the family unit, a government which will restore public trust in our political system, and a government which will help restore balance in the thrust of government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, without the help of very many special people, it would not be possible for me to stand here today. I wish to publicly acknowledge and thank all of those who have helped. I begin by thanking those who have made the long trip down here to support me today, including many friends, supporters and family. I particularly acknowledge the mayor of the Blue Mountains,</PARA>
<PARA>Michael Neall, and his wife, Pauline; the deputy mayor of the Hawkesbury council, Les <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Sheather; the general manager of Hawkesbury council; and several other councillors from Hawkesbury council. Thank you all&mdash;friends, supporters and family&mdash;for making this trip today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all, during the campaign, around 600 helpers contributed to our success. Honourable members will be pleased to hear that I do not intend to mention each one by name. However, please allow me to mention some. I thank, first, the campaign team and other key helpers: Jim Aitken, Jennifer Scott, Chris Vander Kley, Jim Patterson, Randall Walker, Troy Craig, Sean Fannin, Janette Lennox, Quentin Cook, Mike Kouriloff, Bob Stagg, Mal McEwen, Judy McDougall, Wal Howard, Fred Thompson, Daniel Miles, Matthew Barnes, Rebecca Mason, Brendan Cooper, Peta Demery, Mark Connell, Nils Kenny and Peter Bardos. A particular thank you to Betty Smith, who put in so much time for so long before the election. Secondly, thank you to several sitting members: Alan Cadman, Andrew Thomson, Senator Bob Woods and the New South Wales state member Peter Debnam. My thanks also go to a number of shadow ministers who visited the electorate before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, I want to thank my brother and his family and the many friends who gave tremendous encouragement along the way and, in some cases, assisted in spite of their political leanings. I particularly want to thank my wife, Christine, and our family, Kate, Erin and Tim, for their tremendous patience during a long campaign. Christine's tremendous support and encouragement as well as long summer days spent doorknocking with me were invaluable. I would also like to place on record my gratitude to my parents, long since deceased, who, in spite of having so little, gave so much, who raised us in a secure and loving environment, who gave us every encouragement to achieve to the best of our ability, and who taught by example that people are more important than possessions and that giving is indeed more important than receiving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, I want to publicly thank God for the opportunity of serving in this place and for the ultimate direction and meaning I believe <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2385"> He gives to our endeavours. None of us knows how long we will be here, but for the time afforded me my pledge is simply this: to represent with energy and determination the people of my electorate of Macquarie and to contribute in whatever way I can to the delivery of sound government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a great honour to be here. For any Australian to represent their nation and to represent a constituent part of it in the House of Representatives is an honour. To follow my predecessor, the former Prime Minister, is a singular honour. To join the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, which over 13 years returned to this country its future and dragged the country into the modern world, is a special honour. To join my colleagues in the battle to return to office is something I look forward to with great relish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having set the country up for the future, having modernised the economy in our period in office, having recast social policy with a view to equity and decency, and having made the nation conscious of its identity and achievements, Labor can now repair to the task of creatively thinking about and laying down the matrix of our nation's future course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are things in life that do not change like death and taxes and, well might we say, the conservatives in this country&mdash;whether it is the UAP, the Nationalists, the Liberal Party, the Country Party or whatever guise they have taken over the history of Australia. They always have and always will stand for one thing, and that is the principal tenet of their existence: they know what they are against, but they do not know what they are for. They are anti-Labor; they are the non-Labor parties&mdash;the bumps on the road to progress which those going places have to overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliament will no doubt show their best, which from our perspective is their worst. They will let the progress drift; they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will seek to return to their past nostrums. They will grind down the verve which the country has got about itself. They will not understand, for to understand they have to be a part of the ethos of Australia. They never have had and never will have that pure understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to being part of this task. I look forward to being able to represent the electors of Blaxland with the same fidelity, purpose and understanding my predecessor demonstrated over 27 years as the second Labor member for Blaxland. I look forward to dealing with the essence of the things that affect all of our lives. I want my time here to be relevant to the electors of Blaxland and to the people at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has always been left to Labor to do the hard yards, to think creatively and to enlarge the place of the country's future and how it will advance. Its history has been a constant fight against the reactionaries and the conservatives, who make Labor establish a new ideal. Doing that gives them an opportunity to acclimatise, to find their place in Labor's latest creation. I say that they cannot, no matter how much they try, reface Labor's work. We say they will try to turn back the clock, but now it is so much harder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to being in this parliament, to being involved in the issues&mdash;the issues of social equity, economic efficiency, the great adventure of our internationalisation and the firming of our identity. I take this opportunity to thank the electors of Blaxland for the privilege of serving them in this parliament. I take the opportunity to sincerely thank the members of my own party, those who supported me and those who did not. I especially thank my family&mdash;my wife, my mother and my brothers&mdash;and all my close family and friends for supporting me and persevering over so many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 the people of Australia made a fundamental choice. They chose Medicare; they chose a fair, equitable and decent industrial relations system; and they said an absolute no to a GST. The Liberal Party took note. The coalition said that Fightback&mdash;which they had espoused; an ideological statement of their real convictions&mdash;was not saleable. So <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2386"> they put on a cloak and masked themselves. They took that masked figure to the 1996 election. Their campaign for the 2 March election was based on a fraudulent representation of themselves as moderate, sensible and practical. They promised to effectively retain the Labor government's framework. They perpetrated a fraud upon the Australian people and won a campaign based on deception and deceit. They hid their true flint&hyphen;hearted ideological nature behind that cloak of moderation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 2 March, the real nature of the beast that is the Howard coalition government has become increasingly apparent. This is a government of implications. This is a government of hints and whispered indications. This is a government that says the people of Australia should have taken the little hints they gave out in the general election campaign as to their real intention and purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 March the Australian people, for the first time in their history, accidentally elected an ideological federal government to power. The Howard coalition government has already shown behind the flummery and the posturing of their first 100 days that it is a doctrinaire, backward&hyphen;looking and, indeed, an antediluvian creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government, bereft of any real structured and coherent understanding of Australia and its people, is a prisoner of its own dry and dusty past. It has no framework for creatively building a better, richer, stronger and more diverse cosmopolitan society&mdash;a society certain of its core identity, certain of its place in the world and certain of its fundamental adherence to notions of fairness, practicality and equality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party has built a framework in government over the previous 13 years to provide Australia with a modern, forward&hyphen;looking, coherent and practical approach to the main issues that face the nation. The depth and intensity of the Labor Party's vision for creating a new Australia is one that is certain of its past, understands its recent history and has the motive force to take us into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On 15 June the people of Blaxland voted to elect the third Labor member for Blaxland. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They did so not long after 2 March and in an environment in which the Liberals had come to power&mdash;with a very large majority&mdash;on an ideological basis which they had hidden. They won with very great numbers because there were so many marginal seats up and down the coastline of this country. But on 15 June, their first electoral test, the Liberals squibbed it. After having a candidate in every general election since 1949, they did not stand a Liberal Party candidate in the seat of Blaxland in the  by-election. We wonder why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Neville Wran, the former Premier, retired from the seat of Bass Hill in 1986, they knew that Michael Owen, the Liberal candidate they put up, would win the seat&mdash;he did so with a 22.32 per cent swing to the Liberals. Given that that seat is fully enclosed within the electorate of Blaxland, one would have thought that a newly elected government in their honeymoon period, priding themselves on marching towards their first 100 days&mdash;a government that had their popularity rating rise nationally from 47.2 per cent to 54 per cent and which had seen the national popularity of the Labor government fall from 38.8 per cent to 35 per cent at the 2 March election&mdash;would have put up a candidate because they might have had a chance. But what did they do? For 2&half; months they ducked and dived and tried to decide whether or not they had the courage to put up a candidate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder whether it was simple cowardice, simple stupidity or simple arrogance on their part that delivered a 13.46 per cent swing to the Australian Labor Party in the government's first electoral test since 2 March. I wonder why they were so insensitive to their supporters&mdash;who had had a candidate to vote for since 1949&mdash;that they abandoned them. I wonder why they deserted the Liberal voters of Blaxland. The voters then faced a choice of whether to vote for Labor, and many of them did&mdash;13.46 per cent on a two-party preferred basis. On 2 March their candidate, Nick Korovin, scored 30.7 per cent of the primary vote&mdash;two-party preferred, 37 per cent. Yet they could not stand a candidate this time in their first test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The by&hyphen;election for the seat of Lindsay is coming up. The government wants to say that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2387"> will be their first test. But their secret is out. The true nature of that lot over there&mdash;interestingly, the frontbench are entirely absent at this point&mdash;has started to come out. At the 2 March election, we knew the extent of policy in those little documents that they threw out day by day, yet the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) has simply taken the first step and talked about implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people should have taken the little hints, such as those relating to the second airport at Holsworthy. During the election campaign there was a little hint: one group from the northern suburbs said, `Oh, we'd like the second airport not at Badgerys Creek but at Holsworthy,' and the coalition spokesman said, `Oh, what a good idea!' After the election was over, we found that the coalition were mightily impressed with that idea. They proposed a second EIS, and are very attached to the proposal. It is quite obvious that Mr Sharp, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, is very attached to that idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the work of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party in this place since 2 March, it has been revealed that, quite simply, they did a deal. The deal in regard to the second airport of Holsworthy, which just happens to be surrounded by Labor electorates and not Liberal ones, was based upon this: they did not want to have, before the election, an idea that would whack a big, new, seven&hyphen;day a week, 24&hyphen;hour a day airport in the seat of Hughes. They told us afterwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hughes, Danna Vale, who is to speak later, has tried to say that she is going to fight it with all her might. All the Prime Minister has to do is say, `Sorry, we cut a bad deal. It is a terrible thing to do, but we are going to do away with that completely.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 June the electors of Blaxland said they did not want a second <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> airport in Holsworthy&mdash;they rejected the proposition entirely. Not only do they not want a second airport but also they do not want the crushing of general aviation in Sydney. They do not want Bankstown airport, with 4,800, jobs to go. They do not want the Taxation Office in Bankstown&mdash;a regional tax office serving the people and the industry of Bankstown&mdash;to go, costing 650 local jobs. They do not want that on the mark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, they made it absolutely plain that they do not want Medicare to be touched. They made it plain in 1993 and they made it plain again on 15 June. Whether it be an up-front fee or a reduction in the Medicare rebate to doctors from 85 per cent to 75 per cent&mdash;which would mean the end of bulkbilling in Australia&mdash;the electors of Blaxland said, `No!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people know and understand that the Fraser government ripped Medibank to pieces over seven years. This ideological government that we face across this chamber has every intention in their first steps in the coming budget to start the process of the demolition of Medicare. We on this side of the House, and including me as the new member for Blaxland, will fight it tooth and nail. I will fight it on the part of my electors who have said, quite significantly and surely, that Medicare is fair; it is reasonable. Being a Labor initiative is not a reason to rip it apart. They know the system works and works well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Equally, my electors, those who are old and those who have young families, are very concerned about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The notion of bringing in greater user pays from the government scares them. They know that when they go to the doctor and they have to go to the chemist the cost of the medicines they need should be fair and reasonable. They understand that, under Labor, we kept those costs as constrained as we could and that we understood the pressures that were on people. Those points were made very sensibly and clearly by the people of Blaxland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the by&hyphen;election campaign, which went on for about 2&half; to three weeks, I had a campaign team that worked as hard as any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2388"> campaign team could in any election in this country. They were young and inexperienced, but they forged themselves into a fighting force that will be able to work effectively in all future campaigns. My team comprised my campaign manager, John Alam; Justin Lee, the media liaison officer; Leonard McCarthy, who controlled most of the day-to-day issues in the office; Mark Arbib, from ALP head office, who did the campaign liaison; the best on-the-ground man in Australia, Dennis Ryan; and riding shotgun over the whole lot was Councillor David Blake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allied to this team were my wife, my mother and my brothers who have for so long put up with me doing the hard work, day by day, in terms of campaigning. This time everyone was out, not only my brothers but also my extended family&mdash;all of the branch members in Blaxland who so strongly came together in a unified way across the factions to support the Labor Party campaign to enable me to become the third Labor member for Blaxland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that campaign we campaigned sensibly, creatively and we campaigned on this simple basis: that it is possible to establish a trust between the electors and the people who are putting the campaign forward. I think the result demonstrates that. At a time when the Liberals were at an absolute high in terms of their voter appreciation they deserted their people and did not turn up. The vote on the night was 59.02 per cent, on the first scrutiny 58.95. This seat was held for 27 years by Paul Keating, my boss for the last 12&frac14;, my friend for all of my life, the person I voted for in his first preselection 28 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has had, in my opinion, no greater Prime Minister than Paul Keating. He set the framework to take this country into the 21st century. He worked with my colleagues in this parliament to set a structure, to set a coherence, to set a framework, a matrix to take the country forward in his position as Treasurer and then Prime Minister. But Paul has also been my friend for these many years. It was my great joy, privilege and pleasure to work for him as his electorate officer with Veronica Webb, my colleague. We worked on an equal basis. I am glad to say that Veronica <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has chosen to work with me as my electorate officer. She has been joined by Justin Lee as my research officer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I hope to attempt to achieve is to take forward the Labor cause not only in Blaxland but also in this parliament as the member for Blaxland. It is important for our electors to understand when they bring us to this place that we are not just meant to be community politicians, which is of core importance, but that our central task is to be elected to this parliament. Our central task is to think creatively. Our central task is to bring all of the skills that we have and the skills of our party machines in our electorates to bear upon the great issues that face this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say this quite simply and directly: the result in Blaxland of 13.46 per cent against the Liberals, despite the fact that they did not bother to turn up and deserted their people, is the first step for the federal parliamentary Labor Party back towards office in this place. It is the first step because Labor will always be relevant. It is the first step because Labor in government has always been practical, pragmatic and sure-footed. Labor, when we come to power in the next government, with the factions working together sensibly, as they have for the past many years, will be in a position to create a new Labor government that builds on the framework of the past and takes the cause of the ordinary people of Australia forward. I look forward to and anticipate playing my part in this parliament as the spokesman for the people of Blaxland and as someone who will stand up for ordinary Australians and advance their cause.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My election to office most certainly highlights the positive aspects of our democracy. I am a member with very few academic qualifications. I left school at 14 and commenced my working life by following my father into the Queensland railway department. As a junior lad porter, one of my first tasks was to be chief toilet cleaner of the Mareeba railway station. Wanting to improve my opportunities, I was accepted into the RAAF, where I qualified as an aircraft engine fitter and served my country for 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On completing my term in the air force, I worked in a number of professions from maintenance fitter, truck driver and real estate salesman to nightclub manager and wildlife park manager. I was for a time a site convener for the Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union and among my more interesting occupations I spent considerable time as a wild bull catcher and crocodile trapper. These latter occupations, I am sure, will assist me greatly in dealing with the political process in Canberra. Most recently I had my own business interests in the pastoral industry in Cape York and a crocodile farm in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make mention of my background to highlight to honourable members on both sides of the House the fallacy of community perceptions. The perception that the Liberal Party consists only of the privileged and silvertails of our society is just as inaccurate as the perception that the Labor Party represents the workers and less advantaged members of our society.

I discovered that in 1976 National Party member David Thomson read from a letter written by a member of his family in 1888. It talked of the great troubles in getting supplies in and out. He also mentioned the inadequacies of communications in his electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that in 1996 the concerns raised by my predecessor are still as relevant today. Over the years Leichhardt has been grossly neglected by governments which have been quite happy to take the wealth which our region yields, returning little in the way of infrastructure and basic services to the citizens of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My arrival in Canberra after 2 March only serves to highlight to me the inadequacies of the services in Leichhardt. I stand in awe of the fantastic infrastructure and services available to the lucky citizens of Canberra. Coming from a regional electorate, Canberra seems like fairyland. The services provided here are almost beyond the imagination of my constituents. It is little wonder the bureaucrats and decision makers, insulated in the comforts of Canberra, lose touch with the harsh realities of regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Leichhardt in 1996, our Cape York cattlemen still cannot move their stock during the wet due to unsealed roads which are impassable for months. Even travelling to Cooktown, only 330 kilometres north of Cairns, there are 75 kilometres of very rough unsealed road, which has had a serious negative impact on the economy of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2390"> I hear members complaining about inadequate digital phone services. In my elector ate, with the exception of a small area around Cairns, there are no mobile phone services. There are huge areas that have no power. They receive no or limited television and radio reception. Many of those who do have access to the limited communications services are restricted to the ABC. While the ABC may well be an admirable service, unfortunately, it gives people a one&hyphen;sided view. In 1996, I think it is imperative that all our citizens have access to a broad range of communications to give them the opportunity to formulate an informed and balanced view of current affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suburbs in Cairns have little or no access to television and mobile phone reception. I am talking of areas within a 15&hyphen;kilometre radius of our major population centre, one of the largest provincial growth areas of Australia. This is a disgrace, and I am committed to pushing for more equitable access to communications in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the size of my electorate, I will start at the top, an area absolutely vital to the future security, health and wellbeing of our nation. Be assured: threats to Australia's health and our agricultural and pastoral industries are real. Any breach of our stringent quarantine regulations would certainly come through the Torres Straits. Be under no illusion, Mr Deputy Speaker and fellow members: at low tide you can almost walk to Papua New Guinea. It is only about three kilometres from our northernmost island of Saibai&mdash;so close, in fact, that the deer from Papua New Guinea swim across to Saibai each wet, swimming back to Papua New Guinea as the surface water dries up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nasties such as screw worm, foot and mouth and rabies are right on our doorstep. Diseases such as Japanese encephalitis, which took two lives in the Torres Straits last year, should be a clear warning of the risks. Torres Straits has to be acknowledged as our front line and should be treated accordingly. Several weeks ago, a large outbreak of black sigatoka was discovered in banana trees in Weipa. This outbreak is believed to have originated through the Torres Straits. The recent papaya fruit fly infestation in Far North Queensland only serves to highlight the risks.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Smuggling is also prevalent throughout the Torres Straits, with fauna, flora, guns and drugs moving in and out of Australia. While organisations such as customs and the defence force do an admirable job, there has been a continual reduction of funding and a contraction of services which I believe ultimately put our entire nation at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many needs in the Torres Strait. I would like particularly to address two today. Firstly, all members, I am sure, are aware of the vast amount of money that has been spent in recent times on reafforestation programs. This is very commendable and I support these programs. However, I am sure members are unaware that in the Torres Straits in the 1920s the beche&hyphen;de&hyphen;mer fishermen removed every single tree from islands such as Darnley to fuel their fires in order to dry the beche&hyphen;de&hyphen;mer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To this day, not a single tree has been planted in the Torres Strait islands from any program to rectify this problem. I give a personal commitment to my friend Mr George Mye, the Chairman of Darnley Island, that I will work towards rectifying this anomaly to ensure that the Torres Straits get their equitable share of the tree planting programs so that we can bring these islands back to their former beauty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to acknowledge another dear old friend, Mr Etti Pau. Etti is a proud Australian and a proud old soldier. He was a member of the volunteer Torres Straits Light Infantry Battalion that served in the Torres Straits region during the 1939&hyphen;45 war. There has been little recognition of Etti and his comrades and, with only about 150 of those old soldiers left, out of an original 850, I am committed to affording them the recognition they deserve for their wonderful contribution to this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving from the Torres Straits, Cape York Peninsula represents a huge part of my electorate. Cape York is an area rich in natural beauty, resources and Aboriginal and non&hyphen;Aboriginal culture, a place with which I am proud to have had a long association. In recent years, Cape York has been used as a political pawn in an attempt to buy votes in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2391"> urban electorates whose populations have absolutely no concept of the real Cape York.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Much has been said with regard to land rights and reconciliation for our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. If you believe the rhetoric of Labor and the Democrats you would believe that they were the champions of the ATSI people with an exclusive mandate. Let me tell you that this is wrong. The majority of us on this side of the House&mdash;in fact, the majority of fair&hyphen;minded Australians&mdash;fully support these goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not support ambit claims where the hopes and aspirations of grassroots Aboriginal people are raised to unachievable levels only to be told, `It was only an ambit claim', and you have to accept much less or, in many cases, nothing at all. Believe me, many of the grassroots Aboriginal people do not understand the meaning of the word `ambit' and they are left feeling devastated, cheated and angry. It sets Aboriginals against non&hyphen;Aboriginals and Aboriginals against their own people&mdash;it is so divisive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their legal representatives and advisers make a fortune yet Aboriginal people are still dying in disproportionately large numbers from preventable diseases. Unemployment in some Aboriginal communities is as high as 95 per cent. This money could be better invested on health, nutrition and culturally appropriate employment opportunities in Cape York.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These ambit claims also have a devastating effect on the non&hyphen;Aboriginal community of Cape York with so many people living day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day for close to seven years since the possibility of land claims was first mooted. Financial institutions recalled loans and refused to lend for expansion or upgrading. Mining, agriculture and other projects likely to offer an economic future to the area have been delayed and in some cases abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many in the House may not be aware that there are pioneering families who have lived in Cape York Peninsula since the 1860s and over time have developed close friendships and, in many cases, family relationships with Aboriginal people. The Native Title Act, in its current form, is not working and has delivered nothing for the Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said about the recent Cape York heads of agreement. It has been supported by graziers, Aboriginal people, Greens, both sides of the House of Representatives and, heaven forbid, the Democrats. What many may not know is that I prepared and moved the original motion in August 1994 which formed the basis of that heads of agreement. Therefore, I can assure the House that I am totally committed to working towards a long-term future for the Shepherds, the Quartermains, the Jacksons, the Callighans and the Cummings, people like Eddy Holyroyd, Wompi Kepple, Gordon Charlie and their families and all the other fine people in Cape York.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cairns is the population centre of my electorate. The largest population is spread between Babinda to the south to Port Douglas, Mossman and Daintree to the north. The region was originally settled as a port and supply base for the early goldfields. Many of the early settlers diversified into agriculture, particularly sugarcane, which saw the region become one of the largest sugar producing regions in Australia. It was the prosperity and security of our sugar industry that formed the backbone of the region for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1984, the Cairns international airport became a reality and its success can be gauged by the fact that last year there were 2.99 million passenger movements. Exports through the Cairns airport have grown by over 65 per cent per annum for the past five years and currently total some 6,000 tonnes. Fresh fruit, flowers, fish, crustaceans, for the growing Asian restaurant trade, are but a few of the quality Australian products exported out of Cairns on a daily basis. International flights out of Cairns have grown to a total of 67 per week. They go to 15 destinations on 10 international carriers. This community owned facility is Australia's fifth biggest international airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tourism in Cairns is our economic lifeblood and it offers us a bright future. Unfortunately, it has not come without a price. With much of the focus on tourism, many of our industries have fallen further and further behind. I believe it is dangerous to put all our eggs in one basket and we need to look at continuing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2392"> to develop other industries. We are well placed to continue to expand our export facilities out of Cairns and the expansion of the port of Weipa to facilitate live cattle exports and other freight exports is a real option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a ship builder in the electorate, NQEA&mdash;it is a local company; 100 per cent Australian owned&mdash;that in 1983 directly employed 800 people and indirectly employed a further 100 subcontractors. Their ability to build fast catamarans is internationally renowned as is their ability to produce ships for our navy. Unfortunately, for reasons known only to the previous government, NQEA went for 13 years without being awarded a defence contract&mdash;this is in spite of their competitiveness and proven track record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over those years NQEA was forced to scale down its activities to a point where, at the change of government on 2 March, their total work force was less than 300. They were on the brink of ruin when one month after the election a defence contract was signed, awarding a $200 million contract for the construction of two hydrographic survey ships for the navy. This reprieve has meant that they are now re&hyphen;employing. We as a government must ensure that there is a fair and equal distribution of contracts and do all in our power to ensure that this type of unfairness never happens again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, there have been suggestions of closures of the local tax office, CES offices and rumoured reductions in Commonwealth funding for the Cairns campus of the James Cook University, the family law court and the Customs Service. If these cuts are made I can promise that you will hear me screaming. What little we have has taken so long to get. What we need in regional Australia is an expansion of services not a contraction of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of social issues in my electorate that I would like to flag at this time&mdash;I appreciate that I am limited to 20 minutes. At a later stage, I will raise these issues in more detail. We have a chronic shortage of funding in the area of aged care and I am fully committed to addressing these shortfalls.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While raising the issue of aged care, I must bring to the attention of the House the plight of our profoundly disabled youth. At present, those requiring full&hyphen;time care are bundled into aged care facilities and we have, in some cases, teenagers, with minds as sharp as tacks, sharing rooms with aged dementia patients. This is disgraceful. I will be working towards establishing a facility in Far North Queensland specifically to house these needy young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have for many years had deep concerns about the deteriorating situation in the area of mental health. Social changes and a lack of funding have done little to improve the quality of life of those unfortunate enough to be afflicted by mental illness. The previous government's policy of putting more and more mentally ill on the streets without sufficient support puts both the patient and the general public at risk. A complete overhaul of our mental health system is long overdue. I will certainly be a driving force for this agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also of real concern is the present state of our family law system. Family law matters are one of the highest levels of constituent inquiries in my office. There is a large number of desperate people out there. Sadly, nearly every case involves children. Recent figures suggest that more than 10,000 people in my electorate are suffering under the current system. It would appear that the present system is very much biased against the non-custodial parent and there is an urgent need to bring back some balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be able to stand here today in this chamber proudly representing the people of Leichhardt is an achievement shared with many people. While it would be impossible for me to name every one of them, there are some very special people whom I would like to acknowledge. First of all I acknowledge Hal and Faye Westaway, who worked tirelessly through my campaign giving me both moral and physical support. It was Hal and Faye who kept liberalism alive in Far North Queensland. Without their dedication and persistence, my win in Leichhardt could not have transpired.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2393">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to acknowledge Gladys Potter and her dedicated band in the women's council. Apart from their great support, they make wonderful cakes and are exceptional fund&hyphen;raisers. Thank you, ladies. I also thank members of my campaign committee&mdash;Doug and Lyall Jones, Paul Beasley, Kel Ryan, Bob Norman, Peter Taylor, Graham Smith and Nicole Tobin-Donnelly&mdash;and Senator Ian Macdonald, who has kept the seat of Leichhardt warm. I would also like to acknowledge Sandy Mulley, through whose work the Liberal Party was able to win the booth at Weipa for the first time in its history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to thank two very special people. Joy Palmer, after meeting me for the first time, had sufficient confidence in me to give me 100 per cent of her time, loyalty and support from before preselection and through the entire campaign. She is still with me today. Thanks, Joy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another special mention is to an aggressive dynamo from the Northern Territory. Ashley Manicaros joined my team just prior to the election. He had the monumental task of shaking some of the bush out of me and shining up my dull bits while improving my massive four per cent recognition factor. Ashley certainly had his work cut out for him. In spite of the fact that at times he had to drag me along kicking and screaming, this guy persevered and, with the help of his wonderful lady, Janice, achieved results which were not possible of a lesser man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have kept my final thanks to those very special people in my life, my family. First, I thank my wonderful wife, Helen, whose patience, support and preparedness to take a back seat allowed me to get out there and fight for my political goals, comfortable in the knowledge that I always had a warm home and a sympathetic ear to retreat to should I be on the receiving end of a political bashing. I guess you could call her my security blanket. Thanks, Helen. I would also like to mention my three wonderful sons&mdash;Steven, Jason and Jacob, my youngest. I can assure the House that with these three boys you are looking at a very proud dad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, I would not be here if it were not for my mum and dad, Mavis and George <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Entsch. My dad worked for 40 years in the Queensland railways, an ordinary working man but with extraordinary family values. What we lacked in monetary assets was more than made up for with an abundance of love, warmth and a sense of belonging. As a consequence, we wanted for nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like several other new members in this chamber, I too am the first in my family to become involved in politics. I know that my mum and dad are very proud of my achievements. Let me say for the record that it is their efforts in instilling in me a strong set of values through a happy and loving childhood that will have an immense and positive influence on my contribution to this fine House. Thanks, mum and dad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to acknowledge my father- and mother-in-law, Lou and Lorraine Tognolini. Apart from a beautiful daughter, who became my wife, they have given me a tremendous amount of support during the campaign as well as providing a willing baby&hyphen;sitting service on demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obvious from my background that I could not be considered an academic. While I am the first to admit that I come into the House with very little political experience, I arrived here very apprehensive but I must say extremely confident and looking forward to contributing in a positive, practical way with grassroots, commonsense representation which will in time, I am confident, offer a long-term benefit to my electorate and its people. Thank you.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="2393" TIME="11.35 a.m." SPEAKER="Brown, Bob, MP" NAMEID="5A5" ELECTORATE="Charlton" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME>
<ELECTORATE> (Charlton)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.35 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliament is responding to the speech by His Excellency, the Governor-General, on the occasion of the opening of the 38th Parliament. The debate is known as the address-in-reply. It has given members an opportunity to range over many of the issues of concern to them, because the Governor-General, in delivering that speech, outlined this government's intentions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the circumstances in which that speech was delivered and the address-in-reply debate has taken place, following so closely after the election on 2 March, it understandably has provided new members with an opportunity to make their maiden speeches. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2394"> want to take this opportunity to congratulate all of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interesting things about the maiden speeches that have been made by the new members who were elected on 2 March is that listening closely to them helps to reinforce our understanding of the enormous diversity of interests, geography, economic activities and problems across the continent. In the history of the world, Australians have been privileged to be the only nation to have exclusive occupancy of one continent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One hundred and forty-eight people are brought into this parliament from across this continent to represent the people and the interests and problems that those people have. I have been particularly encouraged to hear in those maiden speeches the range of talents and concerns expressed and, as I say, the diversity of those areas from which those members come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have a very special responsibility, as they have indicated. They are very privileged to be in this parliament. They have a very special responsibility to bring into this parliament their concerns without fear or favour. Of course, the vigour with which debates are conducted in this chamber from time to time indicates that not all members of the chamber agree with their colleagues on either side of the House, nor do they endorse a lot of the issues that are brought into the parliament nor the way in which they are expressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But people do not become members of parliament unless, on a preferential system of voting, they secure over 50 per cent of the support of the people in their electorate. So they represent them first and have a responsibility to them primarily, and then of course they have a wider responsibility to all Australians. As I have said, I congratulate all new members. A number of members, because of the enormous change which took place on 2 March in the composition of this place, have yet to make their maiden speech. They undoubtedly are looking forward to doing so because that will introduce them more positively and definitely into the procedures of this chamber and of the parliament generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to be the first opposition speaker to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> follow the speech made by the new member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton). I want to refer to two comments that the honourable member made in his speech&mdash;and it was, I thought, an excellent speech. Perhaps for a maiden speech it was more contentious than usual. But I am not one of those people who subscribe to the opinion that, on the first occasion that members get up to speak in this chamber, they have to be non-contentious. I can think of nothing more stupid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New members should feel free to be as contentious as they wish. They are here to raise issues and to represent their constituents. The least we can do&mdash;that is, members who have been here before&mdash;is extend to them the reasonable courtesy of sitting here and listening to them as they raise those issues. I am pleased that the honourable member for Blaxland has indicated that he is such a person: one who is here to raise issues and represent his constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two particular things he said on which I wish to comment. Firstly, he said, `I want my time here to be relevant.' That is a great aspiration. I believe that all members, in particular all of the new members, would want their time in this place to be relevant&mdash;relevant to their constituents, relevant to the problems they want to express here, relevant to the solutions they want to find; relevant to their understanding of Australia, its place in the world and its destiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, it is perhaps most appropriate that I also refer to the fact that, as we all know, Michael Hatton, having been elected to represent Blaxland in this place, follows the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. Michael said some nice things about the former Prime Minister, every one of which was more than justified and more than well earned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have often been distressed when confronted with what I have thought was a grossly unfair perception of the former Prime Minister&mdash;not on the part of all Australians, but on the part of some Australians. I remember on one occasion, as I was driving through Sydney, listening to the talkback radio program of John Laws. The lady speaking to John Laws was making some very deprecating remarks about Paul Keating. John Laws then <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2395"> simply asked the lady, `Have you ever met him?' and she said, `No.' He said, `Perhaps if you were to meet Paul Keating, your opinion would be different.' I know exactly what John Laws meant when he said that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, everyone who knows or has had the privilege of meeting and knowing Paul Keating knows what John Laws meant when he said those words. Paul Keating is a man of enormous talent, of great vision, probably one of the most visionary leaders that Australia has ever had in any capacity&mdash;a man who is a proud Australian, who had his own perception of the destiny of Australia and its place in the world. He was able to achieve what had obviously been his ambition for a long time&mdash;to become Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I wish to show no disrespect to the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard), I think it was a serious loss to Australia as a nation and as a community that Paul Keating was not able to continue making the quite remarkable contribution which he did make during that relatively short time in which he was Prime Minister. But Paul Keating undoubtedly will continue to use his talents, as he has already shown he intends, in the interests of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing the new member for Blaxland said to which I want to make reference is this: he said, `I look forward to being involved in the parliament and being involved in the issues.' One of those issues to which he made special reference was the issue of social equity. We on this side of the chamber do not resile from, nor do we apologise for, our commitment to social equity. I like to believe that members on the government side also have a genuine concern about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) is nodding his head. He endorses the comment that I have just made. The Labor Party, as the political expression of the labour movement, has based its whole raison d'etre on the need for social equity. For 200 years the organised labour movement, not only in Australia but throughout the world, has not been prepared to accept the belief, still held by some people, that market forces, for example, are adequate in themselves to ensure <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all economic objectives we would set and also social equity. I do not believe that there are many people, incidentally, including those among us who are the most conservative, who would believe that market forces, in themselves, are adequate. But that is the reason for our existence. If we fail to do what we can in the pursuit of social equity, then we fail in our charter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I say just in passing&mdash;and I have made reference to this before&mdash;that this is one of the most uncertain and insecure jobs to which a person can aspire. We, the former Labor government, lost government on 2 March, having held a majority of 11; the coalition government on 2 March came in with a majority of 40. I suppose, in a sense, that is pretty devastating. However, having referred to the uncertainty of this place, all I want to say is this: the Australian Labor Party requires a swing to it of less than four per cent at the time of the next federal election for us to be back in government&mdash;I repeat: less than four per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the swing across Australia were an average five per cent, the ALP would be back in government with a majority of 16 seats. We know that the electorate is volatile; we know the electorate is often harsh in its judgment&mdash;I believe it was on 2 March even though the results that we see in this parliament do not reflect the changes in the voting expressed on 2 March. For example, the opposition got 46 per cent of the votes but we finished up with about 32 per cent of the seats. I don't complain about that. The fact is that when you have a large number of marginal seats that type of change can occur. But 46 people in every 100 voters in Australia still voted for the Labor Party and we lost, in terms of seats, overwhelmingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Governor&hyphen;General, speaking on behalf of the government, introduced his speech on 30 April, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 2 March the Australian people entrusted to a new government the responsibility of managing the nation's affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In doing so they endorsed decisively a comprehensive programme of practical reform. The Liberal and National Parties will keep faith with the people and implement that programme. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2396"> </PARA>
<PARA>Well, I hope so. I hope they do not just introduce the fine print, leaving the detail vague. There was a perception on the part of the electorate when it cast those votes on 2 March that the coalition parties would honourably introduce the types of measure that had been suggested. But we already see, as we come to the end of that period known as the honeymoon period of a new government, the disenchantment. I believe, as I have often expressed, that the alienation of the electorate and the swing against a government starts on day one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have families in Australia that are very apprehensive about the changes this government has already introduced. For example, as a result of that fiasco of a Premiers Conference a week or so ago, every family in New South Wales will be saddled with a state burden of an additional $300, and New South Wales itself will be saddled over three years with an additional burden of $900 million. How are people reacting to that? Families are apprehensive and fearful, and I am one of those people who believe they have good cause to be. The government has made much in its rhetoric about what it refers to as the $8 billion black hole. That has been discredited.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, the minister at the dispatch box says that only we are the ones that believe that that has been discredited. On 8 March, six days after that election, the Australian Treasury, in its report, said, `The economic outlook for 1996&hyphen;97 remains favourable'. It didn't say that the outlook has become favourable in the last six days; it didn't say `We hope it will become favourable'. It said that it remains favourable. Early in May, again after the election on 2 March, Ian McFarlane, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Reserve Bank we are pretty happy with how things have turned out in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He didn't say `since 2 March' or `on 2 March'. They are the two major financial, economic institutions in Australia: on the one hand, the Australian Treasury; on the other hand, the Reserve Bank&mdash;both of them more objectively and more honestly giving credit <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indirectly to what is, in a sense, the economic goldmine which this coalition government inherited on 2 March, despite the rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hear some gasps of disbelief, but let me just give some examples. During the period of the Fraser&hyphen;Howard government, economic growth in Australia averaged 2.1 per cent per year. During our 13 years, it averaged 3.7 per cent&mdash;a 2.1 per cent average under a coalition government compared with 3.7 per cent under the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the process of achieving that type of result, that average rate of growth&mdash;and I have some other examples if I have sufficient time to deal with them&mdash;the Labor government was able to put together what was quite clearly a coordinated, coherent, consistent and effective series of policies. At one time we used to talk about governments adopting fiscal measures or monetary measures but, under that Labor government during those 13 years, the whole question of economic mismanagement and coordination was brought to an art form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me emphasise that. Not only did we use fiscal policy appropriately, not only did we marry that with monetary policy but also we developed wages policy, trade policy, industry policy, competition policy and savings policy. And all of them were integrated and coordinated into a very effective way of dealing with the problems that we had quite clearly inherited from the previous government when we came into office. It wasn't just a matter of economic growth but everything else related to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think there is anyone now who could genuinely deny that, when we came into government in 1983, we in effect inherited an industrial graveyard. Australia was uncompetitive. It was inward looking. The inflation rate was 11 per cent, unemployment was 10.5 per cent and interest rates were 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During our period in government, two million new jobs were created, including over 700,000 of them in the last three years and 500,000 of those in small business. Inflation, which was 11 per cent when we came into government, was left at an underlying rate of 3.5 per cent; unemployment, which had been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2397"> 10.5 per cent, was 8.5 per cent; and interest rates, which had been 20 per cent, were eight to nine per cent. They are the realities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has become a much more culturally diverse nation, a much more sophisticated nation, a much more efficient nation, a much more productive nation and a much more competitive nation. Instead of 13 per cent of GDP being exported&mdash;which was the rate when we came into government&mdash;24 per cent is now being exported. Almost one quarter of the total productive capacity in Australia every year now is being exported. That is a result of some of those changes which took place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that the present government has inherited an economic goldmine. The more honest, the more dispassionate and the more objective members on both sides of this chamber and in the wider community would accept that and would endorse it. The government has that basis now to build on. It will be a test of their capacities to see whether they can do what Labor did over 13 years and continue that program. That is the challenge. Like the rest of Australia, I hope they do not botch it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In all my life, I had never dared to dream that it would be my honour and my duty to stand before you in this honourable House to represent over 83,000 of my fellow Australians. That I am here can be attributed to a confluence of circumstance and destiny in a personal spiritual journey, together with an awareness that, as a lucky citizen of this still lucky country, I have reached that time in life when something must be put back for that which has been received. This is not altruism, but my own fearful anticipation of an inevitable appointment with divine reckoning, where the idiosyncrasies of my life will be balanced with any good bits&mdash;and, mea culpa, I am more than a little short on the good bits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If birth is the great lottery of life, then I must have been one of the winners. I was lucky enough to be born in Australia, to have grown up in Sutherland shire and to have met and married a man who is good and gentle. My husband, Bob, and I had four sons in five years&mdash;which was more good luck than good management&mdash;and we were lucky enough to have raised them in Sutherland shire. I was lucky enough to be a full&hyphen;time mum and lucky enough to have been there to share the joys of rediscovering the world through the bright eyes of our four little Vale boys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention them today because they are the achievement of my lifetime. Together with Bob, I have raised four young Australians who understand the meaning of love, family and commitment. They stuck together as children, and they stick together now, and they have a loving affection and respect for their old dad. So to our sons, Robert, Christopher, Matthew and Alexander, I want to say thank you for coming to live in our house. For so many years, you were my reason for living, you were the only glory I ever wanted, and I am so very proud of you all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I was also lucky to have had a childhood in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s. My mother and father, Albert and Delma Ward, built our family home at Sylvania near the Georges River just after World War II. I was the eldest of their six children and, with my brothers and sisters, our childhood was spent mucking about in old rowing boats on the river. We were the last of the billycart generation, before the invasion of television and technology stole all the real fun from an Australian childhood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I left school and began working at 14, and I was lucky enough to get a job almost immediately as an office junior. But, for a girl, I had a restless spirit and dared to dream of things not usual for girls at that time. When I was 18, I dreamt of flying aeroplanes. I was told this would be impossible&mdash;I came from a working class family, I did not have any contacts in aviation and, besides, at that time such a pursuit for a girl was irrelevant in a world of men. But I was lucky. I worked hard at two and sometimes three jobs and I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2398"> obtained my pilot's licence by the time I was 20.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was 34, I dreamt of going to university to study law, but my betters said it would be impossible for me&mdash;I did not have any contacts in the legal profession, and I did not have the intellectual fortitude to undertake the rigours of the discipline. But I tried anyway, and I was lucky enough to graduate from Sydney University&mdash;one of the most prestigious and oldest universities in the country&mdash;with degrees in arts and law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you see, Mr Deputy Speaker, Australia has truly been the lucky country for me. It is now my turn to pay something back from the bounty that I have received, and to begin to redress the imbalance of the lack of any good bits before my time comes for the greater accounting, by committing myself to the service of the people in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate of Hughes lies to the south of Sydney and for a greater part includes the western end of Sutherland shire, extending north-west to Chipping Norton. I have heard many of my fellow members wax lyrical on the beauty of their electorates but, as the representative of Hughes, I must be silent on its secrets. The secrets need to be kept because from Coalcliff to Como, from Menai to Moorebank and all the areas in between, Hughes is where God comes for his holidays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I do wish to draw the attention of this House to a particular issue in the electorate&mdash;that is, the completion of the Woronora Bridge, which has taken on great significance in local politics. The last Liberal state government began to build a new medium level bridge. However, after the victory of the state Labor government in March 1995, funding for the bridge was stopped. Today the bridge pylons stand silently in the river, mute testimony that the state Labor government&mdash;despite a petition of almost 13,000 signatures, urgent overtures by Sutherland Shire Council and hundreds of personal pleas by local residents&mdash;remains deaf to calls to complete the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election I strongly supported the completion of the new bridge. I now understand that the federal government has already granted $230 million in untied road grants to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the state government in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget. I challenge the state ministers for roads and transport to explain to the people of the electorate of Hughes why some of that federal funding could not be allocated for the completion of the Woronora Bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My opportunity to get serious about putting something back into my community came with the approaching federal election and the need for the Liberal Party to win seats like Hughes. Yet again I was told by those who knew better than I that it would be impossible to succeed. Not only was the sitting member a minister of the Crown but also he had at his disposal the considerable resources of his incumbency plus a 6&half; per cent majority for good measure. It was against the odds, I was told.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without resources and without finances, I took unpaid leave of absence from my job as an associate solicitor in Jannali, and in August 1995 began the hard slog of doorknocking the electorate. I wish to thank the partners of my employer, Macedone Christie Willis, especially Sam and Margaret Macedone, for their support and goodwill, and for keeping my job safe for me if I did not succeed. That our little campaign in Hughes was so successful that it nearly doubled the national swing is a tribute to the many friends and supporters who gathered to sustain us along the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be impossible to thank them all, but thanks must be extended for the kindness and generosity of the people of Warringah conference&mdash;to its president, Angus Robertson, and to Jane Vincent, David Begg and the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), who even came doorknocking with me in Engadine. Thank you Andrew Maiden, Scott Briggs and Meredith Laverty and all the wonderful members of the Young Liberal Movement who worked in the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thank you senators, Michael Baume, John Tierney and Bob Woods. Thank you to the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) and to our state members for Georges River and Miranda. Thanks must also go to our golden oldies, who worked in the campaign rooms&mdash;to Edna and Jack Gentle, Mary Stewart, Nola and Des Lawrence and Norm Humphries, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2399"> to the many others who kept the campaign rooms at full operational strength.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very special thanks and full credit go to our campaign director, Mr Chris Downy, state member for Sutherland, our brilliant ideas man who gave us his experience, his encouragement and his friendship. Thank you to our campaign manager, Brett Thomas, and his wife, Faye; to our generals in the field, Gilbert Vanderjagt, Ian Leeding, Bill Meehan, David Adamson and Steve Simpson; and to our fundraising committee, Jill Deering, Lorna Stone and Jennifer Turville. Thank you to all our supporters and workers who turned out on the day, up before the sparrows so that our booths were ready to deliver long before any opposition arrived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thank you to my own family, Delma and Don Matheson, Hilary and John Tipping, and the most loving thank you of all to my 81&hyphen;year&hyphen;old mum, Delma Ward, who came down from Tuncurry and `womaned' the booth in Bangor all day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To all my men, the four Vale boys and to my darling Bob whose peaceful life I have turned upside down&mdash;he married me for better or for worse, not necessarily for politics&mdash;my loving thanks. Bob, I couldn't have done it without you, mate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stood as a candidate for government because there are things I see in our society today which I do not understand. I am moved to question why, in a country rich in natural resources, mineral wealth and of a population of high creativity and ingenuity, our compasses are all awry. We have not only a huge $8 billion deficit but also over 805,000 of our citizens unemployed, 280,000 of whom have been walking through the experience of unemployment for more than a year and a half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen the homeless, the hopeless and the aimless. I have seen children, one as young as 11, left to face the juvenile justice system alone, deserted by whatever passed for a family in his young life and abandoned as if he were the flotsam and jetsam of life. I have seen the despair caused by youth suicide in my own electorate, the parents and the families, the teachers and friends disconsolate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the depths of despair and no answers as to their questions of why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen the shameful lack of support facilities for the old, the frail and the disabled in our community, and seen how governments fail to support the carers, those wonderful few who toil unselfishly in the care of their loved ones, taking over a burden which rightly belongs to governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen how we have abandoned our responsibility to those amongst us who suffer a mental illness, and I have seen our once friendly, gregarious Australian society change in recent years to one which exhibits a high level of anger and aggression. I have seen a culture of violence flourish, encouraged by the entertainment media where depravity is celebrated and homicide is presented as a brutal form of conflict resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of this House, as an Australian citizen, there are some questions about the state of the nation that I am driven to ask. It has been a long time since anyone has been burnt at the stake for heresy. But I would dare to ask questions of the kinds of principles and values which guide the decision making process of this House which ultimately become the values which determine the priorities in our lives, in our relationships and in our Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent tragedy of Port Arthur has seared the psyche of our nation like no other single event in our history. Australia will never be quite the same ever again. I add my voice to the expressions of sympathy extended to the families and the people of Port Arthur by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). The event at Port Arthur has left, in its destructive wake, some tough lessons from which we might derive some understanding of the direction in which our modern Australian culture is heading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in this House are supposed to be the leaders of this nation. If we do not give our time for serious discussion on the nature of our society, to the kinds of guiding principles we want to uphold as those our society should value, then the compasses may always be awry, and heaven help us all in the future. And the future is our children today. The kind <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2400"> of adults they will become will depend on the kinds of values we uphold as worthy of our own commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mindful of my heresy, I dare to ask the economists among us why is it that the principle of efficiency is the guiding principle upon which our economic realities are based. That such a principle is apparently so readily accepted without debate by both sides of this House tells me that it has the status of dogma. I am not an economist, nor can I pretend to be. But I do have a problem with the dogma of economic rationalism which sacrifices people in the name of `efficiency'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why must every activity, enterprise, business or industry be rationalised in the name of `efficiency'? Efficiency of what? It cannot be the efficiency of our economy, not with a deficit of $8 billion. It cannot be the efficiency of our industry, not with 805,000 people unemployed. I remember a time in the 1950s and 1960s when Australia fairly bristled with a manufacturing sector which made us wealthy, independent and secure in an insecure world and which gave our young people employment and hope and a future. But a new generation of economists has no place for old&hyphen;fashioned economic structures, especially tariffs and other forms of protection. Their litany includes terms like `level playing field', `open economy' and `rationalisation'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what if our manufacturing industry of the 1950s and 1960s was inefficient? Was it so wrong? It provided jobs for the greater majority of Australians and hope for our future. Why is it that a better outcome is to have a small remnant manufacturing sector which may be efficient but which provides very little employment for Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reminds me of a scene in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister </EMPHASIS>when Sir Humphrey wanted to give an award for efficiency to a brand new hospital. `But it hasn't any patients, Humphrey,' said Mr Hacker. `But that's not the point, Minister; it's the most efficient hospital we have. We don't want any patients in it,' said Sir Humphrey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to tell the Sir Humphreys amongst us here that we need to factor people into the economic equation if we want real, effective outcomes for our nation. Otherwise, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the only outcome we will have will be the effect of higher and higher levels of unemployment. The impact of unemployment in a society is well documented. It has a millpond effect and causes loss of self&hyphen;esteem and self&hyphen;identity, mental depression, hopelessness and helplessness, and family and relationship breakdowns. It adds to our crime rate and increases in domestic violence. At its very worst, it eventually impacts as a generational phenomenon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would take this further: the tough dogma of economic rationalism which places no value on people and dominates our political and economic culture is also reflected in the pursuit of self&hyphen;focused materialism and personal convenience in our society. The devaluation of people in the economic world is reflected by a devaluation of people in society generally. It can be seen in the way society values its relationships and the kind of language the society uses. Of recent years, there has even been a shift in the language to accommodate such pursuits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commentator John Hyde, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 10 May 1996, suggested that if we are to re&hyphen;assess our values we should start with changes in our language and that we should start to use the words `right and wrong' instead of the words `efficient and inefficient'. I agree with him. There are certain principles which underpin human relationships and Port Arthur has as much to do with human relationships and the devaluation of human beings as it does with guns, mental health and violent videos. It is a fundamental principle that love is necessary to enrich and sustain the relationship of the family, which is the basic building block of our nation. Families tell us who we are and let us dream of what we might become.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the family is changing. In modern Australia there are parents who do not see any need to provide the nurturing and love needed by their offspring and the word `care' is now used instead of `love'. Relationships increasingly end in divorce and separation without any consideration of proper strategies to deal with the distress of the children. Contrary to fashionable opinion, I can tell you that divorce and separation hurts. We cannot put <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2401"> personal ambition, convenience or the pursuit of lifestyle above the emotional needs of our children and expect to bring up confident and well&hyphen;adjusted young adults. We cannot convince a baby of its intrinsic value as a very special human being in our lives if it is left in long&hyphen;term care from the time of its birth and is collected after work with the milk and the bread.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be those at this very moment who are gathering the wood to burn this heretic, but it seems to me that the process of devaluation of people in the dogma of economic rationalism in this House is reflected in the devaluation of people in relationships in many households in our country. It is the role of government to provide the leadership necessary to reverse the cultural shift and to make this nation a kinder society where effective outcomes are those which include the human equation. Otherwise, I have a fear, a very real fear, that the tragedy of Port Arthur will be revisited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now wish to refer to the recent decision of the government to reconsider Holsworthy, in my electorate, as a possible site for a second airport in Sydney. I give notice to this House that I and the people of Hughes are implacably opposed to Holsworthy as a possible site for an airport and I will fight the government on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, my betters are telling me I am taking on the impossible and I cannot win. There are many environmental and other issues which cause grave concern for the people of my electorate. These will be fully addressed in the EIS process and I do not intend to address such issues here. However, I wish to make it clear that I am very proud to be here as part of the 38th parliament of Australia and to be on the team led by our Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the campaign, John Howard spoke up for the family, integrity and small business. He spoke his truths clearly and firmly. The heartland of Australia heard his call and voted for John Howard. His name is now firmly etched upon the escutcheon of this nation. For me, he is not only the Prime Minister of Australia; he is my Prime Minister. I am very proud of him. I would be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proud to hoist my colours alongside his in any fight, at any time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want this House to know that it gives me no pleasure at all to fight the Prime Minister and his cabinet on the proposal for Holsworthy. But I have a sacred duty to the people of my electorate and it is with a resolute heart that I stand with them against this proposal. There is a grave principle here for which I have a very real concern and that is the principle of trust that underscores the relationship between the government and its people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Hughes and I began a very special relationship during the campaign. I knocked on their doors; I shook them by the hand; I looked them in the eye; and I asked them to vote for me. I am their member, they are my constituents. They are my extended family and I will do my best to look after them. Already they have felt the impact of the proposal but not as much as the sense of betrayal they have in this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask our Prime Minister, who stands up for families and family life, and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to look elsewhere for a location for a second airport. We should not repeat the mistakes of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport in one of the fastest&hyphen;growing areas of Sydney where it will have an impact on over 100,000 homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have told the people of Hughes that I would fight for them on this issue&mdash;and I will not betray them. I come from a long line of heroes and I give my word of honour on this. My grandfather, Mr Donald Dempsey, and his brothers were Anzacs and he and two of his brothers paid the ultimate sacrifice over there. Of his two brothers who returned home, one was full of shrapnel and the other had the Military Medal. My father, Albert Ward, and his brothers fought for Australia in the Second World War and served in Syria, Egypt and Palestine. My husband, Bob, has a citation for bravery from the Royal Humane Society for the rescue of a pilot from the Georges River near Milperra in 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tell you this, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I want the people of Hughes to take heart. They will look at me and see a small and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2402"> insignificant woman but I have inherited the heart and the stomach of an Anzac. I know how to fight and I will never desert them. From this time forward I am at one with them; they are my heartbeat and I am their voice. For them I will take on what others tell me is impossible. I will fight this proposal to the death knock. I will do it with determination and I will do it with guts. I will do it for the people of Hughes and I will do it with the grace of God.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard some stirring words from the honourable member for Hughes (Mrs Vale). Unfortunately, however, I have heard it all before from those opposite. I look forward to hearing it more and more in the months ahead. The wails, shrieks and screams will start when they come to understand what they are actually doing. The contradiction inherent in that speech regarding economic rationalism and caring about families and people could not be more black and white.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply gives the government an opportunity to lay out its program for the 38th parliament. It provides an opportunity for the government to outline what it proposes. Opposition members can then outline their perspectives and projections. Effectively, this debate contrasts rhetoric and reality. It contrasts what has been proposed and what it actually means, and what the government puts forward to the people and what it is going to do. One cannot get past this question about truth and accuracy, and truth in budgeting and information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear that we are going to get truthful budget legislation to make sure that the right figures are revealed. That is quite interesting. Figures revealed to date for the March quarter absolutely confirm the statement from the previous government that the budget was in surplus. Figures released by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) the week after the election forecast a change in the deficit. As all in this House are well aware, 90 per cent of that change involves Treasury projections about growth and employment parameters, not government spending. The deficit that has been talked about by those opposite is one of their own <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> making. It needs to take into account the $6.8 billion the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised the people that he would spend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also promised them that he would give that spending preference over dealing with any budget deficit. In other words, he gave a solemn promise that, if the figures were wrong, he would run a deficit rather than cut those promises. We have seen how long that lasted. It did not last beyond the first week. Day by day and week by week we are seeing evidence of it. As recently as last week there was a massive attack on the state governments, which effectively was an attack on the people. The idea that somehow the state governments can find $1.5 billion without recourse to the community or wiping out services is just ludicrous. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald </EMPHASIS>earlier in the week about it being a gun at the head approach was very apt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a proposed cut to the Public Service of 2,500 jobs through natural attrition. We are now looking at 20,000 or 30,000 job losses. I imagine that there would be 2,500 job losses north of Hornsby alone let alone in the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister was also very strong on the notion of job growth and the idea that small business would massively employ if given some concessions. I find it quite interesting that no-one ever seems able to explain to me why small business people would employ someone extra rather than buy a new car or house or have a holiday, which many of them need, if they made extra money because of a change in taxation or something else. Increasing profits and employing more people are supposed to be magically related. The fact that more than half of all small businesses employ nobody extra seems to escape some people. When small business grew or when company profits improved quite dramatically during our term, we did not necessarily see a concomitant increase in employment. The relationship between cutting provisional tax and lifting employment is non&hyphen;causal. It is a bit of mythology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going slightly further than that, this government fails to understand that it has not learnt from its 13 years in opposition. We heard <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2403"> from the previous speaker about the state of the manufacturing industry when she was young. What she did not say&mdash;what she does not even know&mdash;and what those opposite have never understood is that the manufacturing industry we had was all based on overseas licences. The vast bulk of it was governed and controlled by licences, tools and equipment that were overseas owned and managed. The vast bulk of it was not Australian owned or native. That was not Australia's choice; it was a choice of the owners. Ericsson from Sweden, which had a plant in Australia, would not allow its product to be exported beyond Australia. That was not an Australian decision, but a decision by Ericsson in Sweden about the Australian product and licences. That sort of thing occurs with any company you care to name, be it Heinz or various others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that the opposition does not understand that, to generate real wealth and real long-term jobs, we have to generate extra production. That is what it is about. The idea  that somehow small business people and single family businesses will generate increased production is a nonsense. Most of them require someone else to do the producing. Business is broken up into two kinds. The distinction is not between big and small businesses but between producers of wealth and recyclers of it. Most small businesses recycle wealth that someone else creates. They do it very well and it is a very important function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless the wealth is being generated by somebody, there is nothing to recycle. The steel producers, car makers, pharmacists, farmers and whoever generates that wealth are the ones that policy should be directed at. They can then generate more so that there is more to recycle. The idea that you can somehow regard small business as generating a greater national product for Australia is a nonsense and always has been. It was a nonsense when the opposition was previously in government. That explains its failure to understand the changing world and why in 1983 we inherited an economy, as the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) said, that was an industrial graveyard.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government had the task of taking Australia through the transition 10 years too late. It should have been done 10 to 15 years earlier when the world was changing. It was happening in Europe in the 1960s. Australia was held back by the coalition government because it failed to understand what was occurring in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The transition to technology changes, industry changes, changes in world trade, miniaturisation changes and computerisation changes&mdash;all those things&mdash;was postponed until we came to government. In making those decisions about that transition we had to take into account the effect they would have on the economy and on people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our budget for last year and the budgets we projected for this year and the year after would have balanced people with the economy. They would have balanced the need for fiscal restraint and fiscal sensibility with the effect that would have on people. We are now seeing a jettison of that principle. When the now Treasurer says that our deficit was by choice, he is correct. It was by choice. The choice was either hurt more people and put more people on the scrap heap or carry a deficit for longer and allow the economy and productive growth to come through to recover. That was a choice, and it is the choice governments have to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's whole strategy for this parliament is to reverse that choice and go back to the Fraser era and to the Thatcherite policies of attacking only the economy and disregarding the community. I hope the previous speaker will be shrieking and wailing loudly when she sees the unemployment these policies create, because these policies are draconian. We are talking about a government by its policy choices deliberately reducing growth by half a per cent, at least, in the next one, two or three years. It is deliberately choosing to reduce 40,000 jobs. That alone means that there will be 40,000 less jobs in the next year than there would have been otherwise. That is the price of a so-called budget surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It needs to be understood very carefully that governments make choices to balance social damage with economic damage. The two are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2404"> interrelated and the task of government is to balance and explain those. What we hear from those opposite is never about people. All we hear is a mantra. This is government by mantra, government by slogan, government by quick quip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government's backbench starts to realise what their ideology and their economic policy really means to people, I hope they keep on screaming. Holsworthy has nothing on the impact their policies will have. Holsworthy is a drop in the bucket. People will be hurt much more and for longer by this economic strategy than by any airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The choice between people and economy partly comes back to who works for whom. I think many parliamentarians on both sides of the chamber would share the view that the economy is there to support the community; the community is not there to support the economy. We do not sacrifice our people, our workers and our youth for some so-called economic goal or objective; we harness the people to make the economy work, and the economy works for the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what we have seen so far in terms of the rhetoric versus the reality. We have seen a shift to Telstra. We have seen a government say that foreign debt is bad and should be reduced, and then it introduces a bill to sell $2.8 billion worth of shares in a fully publicly owned company which will increase the foreign debt by $2.8 billion. Those shares will be acquired by local subsidiaries borrowing from overseas fund holders. So that will increase the foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is talking about reducing government debt. It is going to sell an asset which is now earning 13.5 per cent on its asset value to pay off debts which are costing seven per cent. This is a very clear set of strategies! If you can borrow money at seven per cent and earn 13.5 per cent on that money, people would say go and borrow some more and do more of that. If you can earn at least six per cent on your borrowings on behalf of the community, that is a good investment. But Telstra, which is earning 13.5 per cent on its $24 billion worth of assets, is to be sold to pay off debts which are costing, at most, seven per cent&mdash;it is probably closer <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to five per cent. This is clever economics? It is surprising that this has not sunk in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the government's changes to housing. It has cut the states back to a one-year budget so they cannot plan ahead, wiped out any capacity for involvement in urban planning and at the same time moved towards a shift in a voucher system. What it is really doing is taking from the building industry and giving to the rental market increased rents all over Australia by giving people rental vouchers. It is not about helping people; it is about helping certain segments of business. It displays an absolute ignorance of how our economy works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other absolutely terrifying proposal that the government has on the table is the transfer to the states of a series of services&mdash;disability services, the home and community care program, hostels and nursing homes, and health. When people out there in the community realise what this means, they will be absolutely horrified because the Commonwealth is in those programs because they were not being done by the states. The Commonwealth does not go around volunteering money for programs if those programs are already being done. It funded them because no&hyphen;one was doing them. If you look at the history of the SAAP program or the home and community care program, you will find that the Commonwealth is in them because the states were not doing them well enough, or at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why was the Commonwealth involved in the whole area of youth and youth homelessness? Because no-one was doing it. Nothing was happening. We had families and children in enormous difficulty. If you look at the history of that state by state around Australia, you will find that there are massive differences in services and standards. In one part of Australia the service is not equal to that in another part of Australia. We are not one country; we are seven, eight or nine for many issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is now talking about abdicating responsibility&mdash;transferring relative functionality to charities and non&hyphen;government organisations and transferring a lot of responsibilities to the state governments. People are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2405"> elected to this parliament to represent Australia and to do national things, not to give away national responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to move to a more particular issue at the moment. In recent days a number of people have said that, for the 13 years I have sat in this parliament, I have been a relatively serious speaker. I am not frivolous by nature. I do not think I have ever been called to order for interjections. I have been quite strenuous in seeking clarification on a number of issues in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a reason for that, and I think I need to explain it for you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and for the Speaker in his absence. I have sat here for 13 years watching: I watched the vilification of Speaker Childs&mdash;she was treated with absolutely vile behaviour. In the last couple of years I have watched those opposite&mdash;they are now in government&mdash;bring the role and function of parliament on to the national political agenda. It was a political issue. The independence of the Speaker was a political campaign and an election issue. The expectation created was very strong. Many of us agreed with that. Many of us on the other side were not comfortable with some of the things done or statements made by some of our colleagues. We actually believed that there would be some changes. What we have seen has been an absolute charade.</PARA>

We have seen the Prime Minister goading the gallery to make noises. This is the Prime Minister who was going to change the standards. The Prime Minister said in his opening remarks to the parliament that things are going to change. The Speaker also made some opening remarks about what he was going to do about the independence of the parliament. I, for one, felt he would be under some pressure, so I was quite deliberate in asking a series of questions on interpretation, particularly standing order 82: anticipation of debate. If you look at those questions, you will see that I was very careful. I was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> actually trying to assist and clarify because it is very important, particularly for new speakers. The first few months for new speakers are very difficult, as I have observed in the past. Ministers do tend to run the show. I was very careful with those questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter that I refer to now became obvious in recent days&mdash;the establishment of parliamentary committees, which some of us worked incredibly hard to get. The executive never wanted them. We worked very hard to maintain their funding and sovereignty. We watched them being taken over by the executive, by the Prime Minister appointing the chairmen. In other words, backbenchers lost ownership of their committees. Funding for committees has been lost; they have now been emasculated, with their capacity being reduced financially; and their functionality is now changing. That enraged me quite seriously and it became very obvious that all the rhetoric about the executive and the parliament was rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the next six to 12 months the people out there will recognise that this government is doing more of what it complained about. Yesterday I heard the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) complaining about points of order&mdash;the hide and audacity of him in particular!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid. May I offer my congratulations to you on your appointment. Would you pass my congratulations to the Speaker and the other Deputy Speakers as each of you continue the duties in this 38th Australian Parliament. I congratulate our Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who, through his strong and steady leadership, was given a resounding vote of confidence by the Australian electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has never been, and perhaps never will be again, the same make&hyphen;up of elected representatives due to the extraordinary events of the previous 13 years. The choice of the Australian electorate on 2 March sent a resounding shout from the homes and workplaces across Australia that voters had had enough of Labor tyranny, they had had enough of the heavy-handed bureaucratic decree, and they had had enough of political representatives out of touch with the real needs of the Australian taxpayers, to whom all of us here today are accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For their part in electing me to this the House of Representatives I truly thank the electors of Bowman. It is with pride and humility that I look forward to representing their needs. I pledge today to represent all electors of Bowman, as this was part of our campaign theme&mdash;for all of us, not just for some. I congratulate all newly&hyphen;elected members to the House. I extend to them my best wishes and look forward to working with all members in achieving our policy aims and goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the families, friends and communities of Australia who suffered loss and trauma at the tragedy at Port Arthur, I offer sincerest condolences from myself, my family and my constituents. The tragedy brings home the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reality that no&hyphen;one is safe from the terrors of a disturbed mind: that the sanctity and the quiet domain of a Sunday afternoon can be shattered by the actions of any aggrieved individual. If anything, this whole chapter must alert us to the signs and recognition of such disturbed individuals in the hope that their actions are monitored to prevent future tragedies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the families and friends of those recently bereaved through the tragic accident in Townsville, I extend my sincere condolences from myself, my family and on behalf of the electorate of Bowman. To have so many young men die in such unprecedented circumstances in the course of training compounds our grief on such an occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stand here today in this Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia having been chosen by the majority of Bowman electors and not for the simple reason, as some would have us believe, that it was time for a change. I give the majority of electors of Bowman a greater degree of political astuteness and acumen than that. You see, to actually get me to this seat I required a 7.4 per cent swing. On the day there was an initial 12.2 per cent swing to me. The result after the distribution of preferences was a substantial swing of 9.2 per cent, as compared with the national average to the Liberal Party of 4.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2407"> What was once a fairly safe Labor seat is now considered a marginal Liberal seat. That really makes me feel very happy, knowing I have come from having no chance at all to one of being marginal&mdash;`marginal', not marginalised. You see, no-one ever gave me or our campaign very much hope of achieving this outcome except, of course, my mother and father, who are here today to share with me this fantastic occasion. I am here now because of my parents' deep belief in me and their positive encouragement along with that of my immediate family, my husband, Jeremy, and children, Felicity, Anthony and Nicholas, who are here today to share this momentous occasion. Thank you for your love and belief and faith in me. To my brother Roger, sister Vanessa and my other brother, my very generous brother John, I truly thank you all for your support through out the campaign. To the rest of the extended family a very sincere thank you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although not many people gave us much hope of achieving the impossible, our little band of helpers just kept up a consistent effort. These included the state member for Mansfield, Frank Carroll, Warwick Parer and Jim Killen. Thank you for your advice and support. Mind you, we gave ourselves every hope of achieving the impossible. We did it with the assistance of my very capable and politically seasoned father as my campaign manager. I say `seasoned' because he had spent a total of 20 years as an elected member of the Queensland state legislature as member for Mansfield. He had survived the rigours of party political struggles but, as the very best of any political survivor will attest, the only true determinant of your suitability to the job is the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I followed this maxim: let the electorate be the judge, and this is where I believe the previous government went gravely wrong. They totally underestimated the feelings, needs and wishes of the electorate. The other motto which our team thoroughly believed in was the idea that if you think you are beaten you are. As an adjunct to this we were consistently inspired by that motivational phrase: nothing is impossible. With these ideas in tow, our small but dedicated band of helpers went about the arduous task of achieving the impossible. And guess what? I stand here before the House today, testimony to a belief in the philosophy that beats in the hearts of so many Australians: you can make the difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also the collective good wishes of so many people I met through the campaign that gave us heart to just do it. To Sandra Major, Joan Callaghan, Sandy Fox Spencer, Bill Benson, Sam Sermen, Len Quirk, George and Elizabeth Alves and Peter Turnbull: thank you for your unswerving confidence and commitment to the cause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where other campaigns ran on heaps of cash, ours ran on a shoestring budget. I will not tell you how much. Where other campaigns had numerous helpers, we had the same band of about 20. As the time grew short our network grew larger. I am very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proud of the contribution that every branch member, friend of a branch member or acquaintance of a branch member made to the campaign. As well, to all those other supporters in the suburbs that networked so busily, thank you for your faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate, the seat of Bowman, was created in 1948 and named after David Bowman, a member of the state Legislative Assembly. He was elected to office in 1904 and remained there until his death in 1916. Such a political career path I would not wish to emulate. I would prefer to follow my father's way. He left the state legislature of his own accord, choosing retirement after 20 years of dedicated service to the electorate of Mansfield. My electorate's namesake was also part of an unusual coalition, a Liberal-Labor coalition, something I dare say we will never see again in our political lifetimes. The reason for this is the distinctly opposing views of our political ideology. This factor was clearly evident on 2 March of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard in his victory speech said that the things that united Australians were infinitely more important than the things that divided Australians. It is because of that positive thinking that we sit here today in this the most historic parliament in Australia's electoral history testimony to the belief that the will of the majority has prevailed. That particular fundamental tenet of democracy also covers the right of the minority to be heard. The Australian electorate has chosen a significant blend of talent and character.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have never been as many women elected to our side of the House as was accomplished on 2 March, and we did it without quotas. This blended representation will broaden by far the lengths and depths of understanding of the diversity of the Australian electorate. Not least important in this blend will be the distinctive feminine influence brought to the House. I look forward to the challenge in the time ahead and of achieving change&mdash;change which the electorate expects us to deliver, change from the invasive socialistic government of the past to a more responsive, compassionate reflection of the community at large where the will of the majority prevails.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2408">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us here aspire to the giddy heights of political prominence, but we must never let our political ambitions detract from the core of our principles, and that is to serve our electorate. In line with this, we would do well to take on the character of statesmanship rather than that of politician. For as the clergyman James Freeman Clarke once said, `A politician thinks of the next election, a statesman of the next generation.' I am very conscious of the state of politics today and I am very conscious of the need to restore the people's faith in politicians. We need to be strong of character and purpose and we need to be conscious of the need to conduct our business in the House with the required and expected dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that faith in politicians is being restored by the efforts of every returned and elected member in this House. From my observations so far, all members&mdash;with a few exceptions&mdash;are actively engaged in upholding the dignity of their office. For myself, though, I will always be conscious politically of what is right and wrong, for nothing which is morally wrong can ever be politically right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For my part, I can honestly say that I am glad I was born when I was. There is no other period of history that I believe would provide for me a more important era. For you see, Mr Deputy Speaker, I belong to that generation that knows what life was like pre TV. Yes, I am that old. And yes, I grew up in a neighbourhood where we had to walk down the street to watch TV at a neighbour's house. Home life was exceptionally busy, with all the domestic chores that the whole family participated in. It was a time when neighbourhood gangs went hiking into the bush, played street cricket and cops and robbers, and generally had good, clean fun. Sadly, the connotations of the word `gang' today strike a very different note, one of fear and dread, one in which personal safety is at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My time as a child was also a time when grandma lived within the family. Those halcyon days pre TV, of neighbourhood camaraderie and the security of the nuclear family are all but memories of a long lost past. Our present state of family deterioration is not a legacy of the past but a product of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> present&mdash;a product of rash and senseless policy over the last 13 years which has aided and, indeed, set the foundations for the deterioration of family life as we used to know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seeds of deterioration were set within the community as long ago as 1972, with the easy availability of divorce and the do&hyphen;your&hyphen;own&hyphen;thing social credo. We can look back now and reflect that sex, drugs and rock and roll have brought us to the very brink of moral decay. His Honour Judge McGuire, President of the Children's Court of Queensland, recently made several observations attesting to this point. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are fractures in our civil society. The moral order is breaking down. The family is failing.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moral leadership is all about exemplifying excellence. Morality is about developing a now little understood and almost forgotten word&mdash;virtue. It is about faith, duty, courage, generosity, trust, self&hyphen;discipline and love.</PARA>
<PARA>As a past teacher, some of the children I have taught have had a fragmented home life, fed on a diet of endless TV and video games. The post Port Arthur period has given us the opportunity to assess the effect and impact of videos&mdash;and, indeed, TV&mdash;on the development of acceptable models of behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents are the primary arbiters of what constitutes acceptable models of behaviour. I would encourage parents to have the confidence in themselves as primary care givers to grasp the nettle and, in the words of a famous song, teach your children well. Try to be positive, firm and frank. Take time to listen to them and to talk with them&mdash;not at them. And, most of all, give them time to be just that&mdash;children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue of a domestic nature is my advice to mothers that we have created a society where it is expected that a woman can only have a fulfilling life outside the home. Yes, we should have equal work for equal pay. But let us also have equal respect for the choices women make. Let us not devalue or ignore the rights of women who choose the home or work life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is always a price we pay for the decisions we make. Where the economic <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2409"> pressures are so demanding, there is no choice other than a working lifestyle to support your family. However, the formative years of childhood should be recognised for what they are&mdash;the foundations for personality and behavioural patterns. We are seeing the effects now, some years down the track, of unsupervised TV habits, little listening time and the expectation that material possessions are the hallmarks of good parenting and social acceptance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I consider the points I have just described to be the substance of the duty with which I have been charged to carry out on behalf of the constituents of Bowman. My responsibility and duty, for one thing, is to safeguard the sanctity of the family. As the primary source of security and growth for our future, the homes and families of Bowman are my first concern. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a wonderful opportunity with this new government to do a lot of good. Those in genuine need have the governmental network to assist them in difficult times. Bowman has several interagency networks operating to meet the needs of families and members of the community in times of crisis. The Redland Community Centre provides valuable assistance to a variety of members of the community in terms of legal advice, health and recreational advice, the provision of educational support for parents and crisis support. The local, state and federal spheres are involved in the expansion of these services with cooperation and management planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As these are so successful in their operation in the Redland area of my electorate, I will work to improve facilities at the Wynnum end of the electorate as well. These facilities need the support of both state and federal funding to see this venture completed successfully. To this end, the provision of a permanent multipurpose community facility needs to be established to house community information and to be a meeting place central to all within the local area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bowman is an electorate brimming with natural and human resources. The islands, the history, the fishing and boating pursuits and the Aboriginal history of Moreton Bay combine to provide a potential boom for tourism <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in this area. The energies of dedicated local entrepreneurs have provided great potential for the tourism industry. The small business community, through their chambers of commerce, foster and develop business and employment opportunities. The region's development is in the hands of local, state and federal government and must be monitored and nurtured wisely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An area that needs monitoring is the long&hyphen;term plans and provision for water resources to meet the growing needs of our Redland shire. To manage this resource effectively, we need to plan for the next five, 10 and 20 year time frames so that supply meets demand. The success of our long&hyphen;term planning can only be determined by what is being done now to ensure the security and availability of this most precious resource.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Port of Brisbane is the gateway to the rest of the Australian capital cities. With the completion of the standard gauge rail link to the port, there is now the distinct possibility of cheaper transportation costs, with Brisbane being the first port of call for overseas importers. This possibility will become a reality through the vision and enterprise of the federal and state governments and those on the waterfront and in the boardrooms of the companies that want this enterprise to succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot overemphasise the importance which I attach to the issues concerning families and youth, business and enterprise, the environment and communities in my electorate and across the nation today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things are, above all else, the cornerstones of our society. How we develop, nurture, support and encourage each of these to succeed will ensure progress towards a caring, prosperous society. It was the previous government that sought to tear down the very fabric of our society. The very fabric of family, business and our future prospects was torn apart with the intrusive negative belief that the state was the primary source of all power. The electorate put paid to that notion on 2 March. The previous government's records rated pretty highly. There were higher rates of divorce, higher rates of domestic violence, higher rates of single parenthood, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2410"> higher rates of youth suicide and higher rates of small businessmen going to the wall. As the new government we have the responsibility and opportunity to do something about reversing these trends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a politician I will work towards a remedy for the woes which beset the lives of many of my constituents. I will work towards providing employment for all by encouraging smarter labour market programs and by building on the successes already established. I will endeavour to foster a more caring and compassionate response from bureaucrats who have lost touch with the clients they serve. It is the responsibility of all Australians to work towards a less violent and intimidating society. The legislation from this parliament must reflect those basic guarantees of security, compassion and hope and reflect broader acceptable community standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Bowman I will do everything in my power to address these issues and will make a start by providing answers and solutions. It will take a great deal of effort, but with a lot of hard work you can achieve almost anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, may I just state that I intend to do my very best for the constituents of Bowman. Anything less would be a gross failing on my part. With this in mind, let me echo the words of John Galsworthy, the British author, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I shall pass through this world but once. Any good things, therefore, that I can do, or any kindness that I can show to any human being let me do it now. Let me not deter it or neglect it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one listens to the speeches that have been made over recent times from new arrivals in this parliament one can only feel some concern for them because, undoubtedly, as the days, weeks and months pass the expectations that they are enunciating of their own government are going to be dashed. We know that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the promises that were made by the current government in the run&hyphen;up to the election cannot possibly be fulfilled. It will be a matter, as time passes, of reminding them and the Australian public of the broken promises, some of which have already surfaced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be reminding them every day of every week of every month of every year of the false expectations and the false promises they have made. But I do have a concern for a number of the new members who, I believe, quite genuinely expect that the promises that they have made and are party to will be fulfilled. We know and their superiors know that they will not and cannot be fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks at the leadership of the Howard government it can be seen that it is a government of economic rationalism&mdash;it prides itself upon that. I have listened to some of the speeches over recent days and I have heard some of the speakers from the government side decrying economic rationalism. It makes one wonder at how little information is distributed among government members themselves and certainly information is not being passed down from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and senior ministers to members of their own backbench, otherwise a number of the comments that have been made in recent weeks would not have been made by government members. As the days pass, they will see the evidence of the economic rationalism within their own government and they will see their expectations dashed. They will then have to explain to the people who supported them on 2 March why they are breaking their promises, why they are adding to unemployment and why they are not carrying out the promises made, particularly in respect of business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government does not have a wages policy. It has a `Cross my heart, hope to die, trust us, things will work out okay' policy. The government has already enunciated a very strict fiscal policy. It is already back into its old kilter of the Fraser government: chopping public expenditure, labelling and decrying federal public servants and hammering away at anything that in any way is connected to the public sector as if it is some kind of alien action, something to be despised and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2411"> something that ought to be excised from our economy and from our community. That is not new, but the cuts in government expenditure and the cuts to federal public services mean worse service. At grassroots level&mdash;at the domestic level&mdash;it means fewer public servants, longer delays, poorer service and more mistakes for the people who have to use major departments like the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the Department of Social Security. Every member of this House will be dealing with that a little later on as the effect of those cuts starts to bite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to regional Australia, it should be recognised that 85 per cent of federal public servants do not work in Canberra; they work out in regions like the Hunter and Central Coast regions of Australia. That is where people live and that is where the services are required, particularly those areas with a high retiree population. The demand for services from departments like the Department of Social Security is all the more needed in those areas and the services are all the more important. As those cuts bite and as people start to realise that the cuts affect the services they are going to get, there will also be a flow&hyphen;on effect into the local economy; there will be a flow&hyphen;on effect into regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor governments of recent years pursued a policy of regionalising federal government services; we set about taking federal government services out to where the people are. We did not just have a Department of Social Security office in Newcastle, one in Gosford and others in Sydney. Services were expanded so that there was a Department of Social Security regional office in Charlestown&mdash;in my electorate&mdash;and offices in Cardiff, Newcastle, Mayfield, Maitland, Wyong, The Entrance and Gosford. The services were taken out to where the people are. In that way people get a better service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who need those services often do not have the means of getting around easily and it improves the service. Also, having more federal officers working in regional Australia generates more jobs for people servicing those officers in regional Australia. What we are seeing is simply a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reversion to the old Fraser&hyphen;Howard government policy of centralism. They mouth regionalism and they mouth anti-centralism, but they practise centralism, pulling everything back to south of Sydney Harbour Bridge or back to Canberra. What it is going to mean is worse service&mdash;worse service for veterans, worse service for pensioners, worse service for the unemployed and worse service for people in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our Hunter and Central Coast regions there has already been a freeze on funding for employment and training projects. Staff are being cut from the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. There is a double whammy involved for unemployed people because there are fewer employment projects and fewer federal training projects, so there is less opportunity to try to get the training needed to get a job, and there are fewer jobs to be had. On top of that, because of the cuts in departmental staff, there are fewer departmental people available to provide service. Then on top of that comes a triple whammy: with the 30 per cent cut in funds for Skillshare centres and the freezing of funding, with funding only until September of this year, it means that even community based organisations like Skillshare, which have performed a herculean task and provide an excellent service operating from a community basis, are going to have less ability to train people and also to place those people in employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is back to the old Fraser&hyphen;Howard government policies of the past: stigmatise the unemployed, name them, demean them, reduce the number of jobs available, try to change industrial relations and then put more pressure on people who are out of work to accept lower conditions, poorer pay and longer hours. There is one simple slogan that is unspoken by this government but which best summarises what their policies mean. What they are really about when we are dealing with unemployed people, training, industrial relations and awards is 12 hours work for eight hours pay. That is the slogan of this government, that is what they want: 12 hours work for eight hours pay. If you look at all of the packages they have been putting <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2412"> together over recent weeks and what is coming in the budget, it is about reducing the ability of people to get a fair return for their labour and it is about reducing the conditions that go with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly concerned that we have already seen cuts of almost 10,000 in the federal Public Service and further predicted cuts of almost 20,000. My concern is about the impact that this is going to have on the Central Coast and on the Hunter region as a flow&hyphen;on or multiplier effect. Taken together with the impact upon Skillshare, it is just going to make jobs scarcer and harder to find and there will be fewer resources to help people get those jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks through the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply and through the statements made before the election and listens to the speeches being made by ministers opposite&mdash;I excuse the backbench because a lot of them do not know yet and have not realised yet what lies ahead of them&mdash;one sees that this is a government of deception. I will go through some of the deceptions. We had an election campaign of general and vague promises. Effectively, what the coalition said was, `Whatever the Labor government is providing, yes, we will provide the same thing&mdash;you wouldn't have Keating as Prime Minister, but we will provide everything else. Higher education&mdash;yes, protected; employment training&mdash;yes, protected; funding for industry&mdash;yes, it will be there. Everything will be there.' You can go through all of the papers issued before the election. The deception that was practised!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go first to the deception that was practised on families. The most important issue for a family is to have a family income, for there to be a breadwinner or however many there are working in the family. But they must have incomes&mdash;that drives everything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I have referred to the attack on the trade union movement and the way members of trade unions and trade union officials are scorned and stigmatised by this government as though they were undesirable people. When a member of a trade union is stigmatised, the family of that person is also stigmatised and demeaned. So step 1 for the govern ment is an attack on members of trade unions. Step 2 is an attack on trade union officials and the organisations themselves. Trade unions are like business organisations: some are better than others. They are there to serve their constituencies, and some do it better than others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After having an income, health and shelter, health services are the next thing of great importance to families. The Liberal and National parties eventually had to give up trying to abolish Medicare because they realised that the Australian public wanted the services and protection that Medicare provide. They said, `We will protect Medicare. We will maintain Medicare.' Who said that? It was the same man who said it during the term of the Fraser&hyphen;Howard government&mdash;the now Prime Minister. At that time he said, `We will maintain Medibank.' During the life of Medibank, in the seven years of the Fraser&hyphen;Howard government, there were nine different health schemes, each one worse than the last. That is why people turned back to the Hawke government in 1983&mdash;they wanted Medicare and full health protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the present government is really saying, and what the coming days will reveal, is that it will maintain Medicare in name but not in nature. The government has already signalled various changes. Whether it will be a co&hyphen;payment, a change in the amount of payment to doctors or removing support from another form of service, only time will tell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pharmaceutical benefits are linked to that. It is also very clear even at this stage, so far ahead of the budget, that pharmaceutical benefits are going to be chopped. There is going to be an increased charge to families, to users of pharmaceutical benefits. So two health areas&mdash;Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits&mdash;are involved; but the worst thing is the unloading of responsibility for health services and aged care services onto the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Federal governments are there to provide for people the services they cannot provide for themselves. That is why governments exist. The federal government is involved in health services because it has been proven over the 95 or 96 years of federation that, as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2413"> a nation, Australians ought to be able to expect the same standards of health care whether they are in this part of the continent, or a few hundred kilometres to the north, or up over the Queensland border, or south of the Victorian border. As Australians, when we are ill, we ought to have access to the same standards of health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is proposing to transfer that responsibility back to the states and to fragment it. Members opposite can say, `Oh, no, no'&mdash;just let time pass and they will see. If the states are stupid enough to fall into this trap, health services will be degraded and fragmented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next deception of this government concerned youth unemployment. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has said that between 27 per cent and 35 per cent of youth are unemployed. Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training is his proper title, but I always think of him as the minister for ideology. This is the man who wrote all the ideological speeches for Prime Minister Fraser. He wrote the hard right, far right, Genghis Khan stuff that came out of the Fraser government. The current minister was the author of that; and nothing has changed. When I hear him speak and read his words, I know they are the same&mdash;</PARA>

I recommend all members read this article because he is putting across at this stage, three months after the election, what we were trying to get across before the election. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone of us knows there are lies, damn lies and statistics . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Referring to youth unemployment, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can you imagine that this mere statistic could become so deeply entrenched in people's consciousness that anyone who attempted to expose the statistic for what it was would be rejected immediately as someone trying to lie to them with statistics.</PARA>
<PARA>He explains:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statistic in question is the youth unemployment rate which at present is an appalling 27 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>He refers to former Prime Minister Keating's commitment to the long&hyphen;term unemployed and the job compact. He makes the point that Prime Minister Howard has neither in the campaign nor now made any reference whatsoever to the plight or the needs of long&hyphen;term unemployed. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We never talk about the number of young people who can't find full&hyphen;time jobs; we only talk about the youth unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA>He asks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How many kids are there who can't find jobs?</PARA>
<PARA>There are 1.3 million kids between 15 and 19. How can 27 per cent of them be unemployed? If there were 27 per cent of them unemployed, that would mean 350,000 were out of work. But the actual figure is 90,000&mdash;seven per cent, not 27 per cent. The honourable minister might have made a mistake and put a two in front of it. But it is not 27 per cent or 32 or 35 or 34; it is seven per cent of people between 15 and 19 who are unemployed. He goes on to explain:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only 330,000 are in the full&hyphen;time labour force. Of those, 240,000 have full&hyphen;time jobs and 90,000 are still looking for one.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to refer to the fact that when Mr Howard left office as Treasurer in April 1983 the number of unemployed teenagers was much higher than it is now. It was 150,000 people between 15 and 19 who were out of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2414"> work. Today it is 90,000. This is, as he says, `Howard's unemployment hoax.' I am going to hammer that through wherever I can. The article further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a scandal all right: the scandal of politicians seeking to exploit the public's misconceptions rather than correct them. They are perpetuators of the great youth unemployment hoax.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable minister I referred to earlier is party to that. The other deception being practised is in respect of small business. Some of the new members come from small business, as did I in an earlier life. What I grieve about is the cruel deception being practised on small business. There are 798,000 firms with less than 100 employees. They are called small business. Forty&hyphen;eight per cent of those firms do not employ anybody. In other words, they are self&hyphen;employed business people. Of those firms, 17 per cent are in the manufacturing industry. The ones we hear most noise about are those who are small retailers. Their expectations are being raised by this government about how prosperity will reign forever because Prime Minister Howard has been elected. I just feel deeply for those people. They are going to be gravely disappointed because this government is about the big end of town; it is not about small business. It has never been about small business.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, and, through you, the Speaker and other Deputy Speakers on your election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great honour and privilege to present my first speech in this place and to represent the people of my electorate. Makin was created in 1984 and was held by the Labor member, Mr Peter Duncan, until the 1996 federal election; and I acknowledge his work in representing the people of Makin. I wish to sincerely thank the electors of Makin who placed their faith and trust in me on 2 March. They have charged me not only with the challenges but also with the responsibility to represent them and voice their concerns and aspirations in this place. I would like to assure the Makin electors I will serve them to the best of my ability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electorate of Makin is named after the Hon. Norman Makin who, as Sir James Killen informed me, had a very long and distinguished parliamentary career. In the words of Sir James Killen, Norman Makin was a great and decent bloke. In his first speech in this place, Peter Duncan stated that Norman Makin was noted for his lifelong fight against poverty and inequality as well as for peace. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2415"> These are, as all members of this House would agree, most noble ideals for which many of us would also strive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Makin electorate, with a population of over 88,000 electors, is mainly residential. There are over 2,500 small businesses and the electorate incorporates three local government areas, Tea Tree Gully, Salisbury and Port Adelaide-Enfield, as well as the state electorates of Newland, Florey, Playford and Wright. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my state colleagues, Mr Sam Bass and the Hon. Scott Ashenden, for their assistance and support. I especially thank Mrs Dorothy Kotz, the member for Newland, for her counsel and encouragement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Makin is a wonderful area to live in and represent. It is a rapidly developing area, well serviced by schools, transport, shopping and recreational facilities. But it is also an area of high youth unemployment and of many families struggling to make ends meet. The reason why so many people voted for a change of government on 2 March was that under the previous Labor government poverty, inequality and unemployment continued to increase. According to the 1996 UNICEF report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Progress of Nations</EMPHASIS>, Australia has an overall child poverty rate of 10 per cent and more than 50 per cent of Australian children in sole parent families are living below the poverty line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This crisis did not occur between 2 March and today. The results of the UNICEF report illustrate with great clarity the abysmal and monumental failures of the policies of the former Labor government, which claimed to stand on a platform of social justice. During the 14 months I was a candidate for the federal election, my campaign team, ably led by my two campaign managers, Trevor Johnson and John Dawkins, organised a doorknocking team to accompany me while I worked through the electorate. I would like to take this opportunity to thank both Trevor and John for their tremendous efforts over many months&mdash;and I am pleased to be able to acknowledge John, who is with us here today in the gallery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electors of Makin, including many former Labor supporters, told me that they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expected things to get better after the recession that we had to have. They believed Mr l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w Keating when he promised that he would deliver and that he was bringing home the bacon. Well, he did not bring home the bacon; in fact, the cupboard was left bare and with an $8 billion deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reality, what was happening to many families all over Australia was that by the end of the pay week they were struggling simply to pay their grocery bills, because of the high interest rates and unemployment created by the former Labor government. By the end of the week it was a struggle to keep up with the basics of bread and milk and school lunches. With high unemployment, more families were relying on the services of charity groups in the non&hyphen;government sector in order to survive on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis. Community service providers in the non&hyphen;government sectors have been increasingly overwhelmed by desperate requests for diminishing resources from many families unable to cope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern expressed by many parents was that they worked hard for many years to give their children better opportunities in life, but, after many years of struggling, their children were left without jobs or hope for the future&mdash;becoming yet another statistic. What the former Labor government managed to achieve, even with the much heralded accord, Working Nation, the infamous unfair dismissal laws and a social justice platform, is a lost generation of youth&mdash;lost not to a war or to catastrophe, but lost to the despair and hopelessness of unemployment. That is one of the many legacies left by the Hawke&hyphen;Keating Labor governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask: where is the social justice in unemployment? Australia was once a land of opportunity where effort was fairly rewarded and you could aspire to gaining employment and buying a house on a quarter&hyphen;acre block with a Hills hoist in the backyard, which is what my father aspired to some years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My mother and father migrated to Australia from Germany after the Second World War. At the age of 22 my father arrived on Australia's shores with two pounds in his pocket, the work clothes on his back, a suit for church on Sundays, and his much loved <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2416"> banjo. The first thing he did was set about finding a job. Within a few weeks he was working for the railways. His accommodation was a tent in which he lived for nearly two years at Islington, which in the 1950s was known as tent city. My mother, over the years, taught herself not only to speak and read English but also to write it&mdash;without, I might add, any government assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My mother, who passed away 12 years ago, is not able to share this special day with me. However, my mother did see her daughter join the navy and follow her footsteps in nursing, her chosen career. Although she is not here today, I know she would be extremely proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My father was anxious to secure an apprenticeship as a mechanic, which he eventually did in Gawler, South Australia. By this time he was married and starting a family. As apprenticeships did not pay much, he worked at a second job to make ends meet, as well as repairing boots and shoes in his spare time. My father was eventually able to start his own business, which became very successful over the years. However, with the incoming Whitlam government, businesses started to decline and continued to the point where, as a small businessman who once employed three or four, he currently employs only one person. I would like to mention, for the benefit of the members on the other side, that as family members we also worked in the business from an early age. I have often washed my hands in Solvol and I can assure those members on the other side that my father still washes his hands in Solvol, even after almost 40 years in business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My parents taught us to work hard, to be independent, to stand up for what we believe in, and never to take no for an answer. For these values I am thankful, as their influence on my life encouraged and fostered my interest in community affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many business people in Makin, including my father, voiced their concerns in relation to the unfair dismissal laws, bureaucratic red tape and taxation. The No. 1 impediment to employing more people was the shackles of the unfair dismissal laws. I commend our Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> keeping the first of his many election promises made during the campaign of setting up a small business deregulation task force with a specific charter to investigate ways in which the burden of compliance with red tape can be halved. The task force must report within six months so that the implementation of the recommendations can commence as soon as possible. This will allow small businesses more time to devote to doing what they do best, that is, creating job opportunities for expansion and growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to commend the Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon. Peter Reith, as I have great faith in his comprehensive, fair and constructive industrial relations policies, which will help small businesses in Makin to get moving again. Though we are especially concerned with youth unemployment, unemployment in general is also of great concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is beyond my comprehension that even with all their advisers, the accord, revolving&hyphen;door training schemes and previous years in government, members on the opposite side have failed to learn one of several simple fundamental aspects of basic business practice; that is, if employers are either unwilling or unable to employ people, then there are simply fewer job opportunities for the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For every person unemployed there is a double debit on the ledger. There is a decrease in income tax revenue and a corresponding increase in expenditure which contributes to a higher budget deficit, leading to increased payments on interest and so on. Hence, there is less money to spend on health, education and welfare for those in genuine need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people in the Makin electorate believe that the main achievement of the ACTU over the years has been the elevation of union officials into safe federal parliament seats. Where was the ACTU on unemployment? What did the ACTU do for our unemployment queues? Rather than looking after blue&hyphen;collar workers and the unemployed, they looked after former ACTU presidents, treating the Labor frontbench as their retirement home. While I am disappointed that the ALP <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2417"> has been unable to select more women for winnable seats, especially in Blaxland and Batman, I have no doubt that, on past performances, Jennie George is on her way here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, and since becoming the member for Makin on 2 March, I have had many constituent inquiries in relation to the Child Support Agency. I am pleased that the minister responsible for the Child Support Agency, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Jim Short, and his department are working towards addressing the problems that many clients and staff have to face on a continuing basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many constituents feel that the child support formula is unfair, as it is calculated on taxable income minus exempt income, rather than on net income, which is the amount of money the non&hyphen;custodial parent has to live on in real terms. Many people have conveyed to me that, in their view, the reason why child support payments are avoided is the perception by non&hyphen;custodial parents that the formula appears to be unfair. I give notice to Senator Short that this is an issue that I am prepared to investigate and pursue in support of both custodial and non&hyphen;custodial parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aged care and its future direction is an issue that is very close to my heart. After completing my nurses training in the Australian Navy, I moved into the area of aged care. For the last four years I have had the honour and pleasure of working for a Christian based private nursing home and hostel where the resident care is of an extremely high standard. The dedication of the nursing, domestic and administrative staff and the management team was truly inspirational. It needs to be so because of the many problems we, as carers, face on an ongoing basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">South Australia has a higher than average proportion of people over 65. The need for respite beds is not currently being met, with 140 people desperate for nursing home beds which are not available. The most pressing problem for those working in aged care, particularly in hostels, is that the incoming residents are the frail aged, and more and more are being admitted with high&hyphen;care dependency due to dementia. Carers have an important role within our community, whether <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they are in the paid work force or are caring for family members in the home environment. The dedication of carers in our society cannot be underestimated, and this is an area that needs to be monitored and addressed in the not too distant future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another health area that causes me great concern and that is what is happening to those within our community with mental health problems. While many cope with medication and family support, there are also those who do not have family or community support. The extent to which deinstitutionalisation has proceeded in the so&hyphen;called interest of the mentally ill needs to be reviewed. Perhaps it is time we revisited the Burdekin report and seriously considered its recommendations. We also need to consider what the term `quality of life' really means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a young family to raise in a society where there is much peer pressure, I am concerned about the amount of pornography that is readily available. I recently raised an issue with the Office of Literature and Film Classification. In a sports magazine that young children purchase to read about their basketball heroes were four photos taken from editions of American <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Playboy</EMPHASIS>. As the magazine concerned is a sports magazine, it is not required to pass through the classification process. Many parents raised their concerns that a magazine promoting sport should be allowed to print pornography, regardless that some people regard the photographs as `soft porn'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some may recall the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS> and the controversy that arose around that film. I actively opposed the screening of that film in Adelaide. What message do we convey to our young people when we allow such pornographic films portraying the brutalisation and the physical, sexual and emotional abuse of children to be screened? We have seen and heard much about sexually abused children in recent times and yet we do little to limit the number of pornographic films and the amount of pornographic literature available.</PARA>

To that end, I commend the Minister for Communica tions and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, for setting up the ministerial committee to look at the portrayal of violence in the various forms of electronic media.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one becomes a member of this House without great support from family, friends, and the hard workers of political parties. I am pleased to acknowledge my federal electorate committee chairman, Mrs Wendy Benson, who is in the gallery today. Wendy and her FEC team provided the financial and physical support that is required to make a campaign work. The hours of letterboxing, doorknocking and fundraising that went into making the Makin campaign so successful could not have been achieved without the support so willingly given. My family and friends were always there when they were needed and to them I say thank you. One's electorate committee, family and friends are also the people who keep your feet on the ground and who give that little bit more when the going gets tough; and their personal sacrifices make it possible for the candidate to do those extra hours of campaigning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Makin campaign also had tremendous support from Senator Nick Minchin and the Hon. Ian McLachlan. Their counsel assisted me many times throughout the months of the campaign and for that I sincerely thank them. The support and friendship also given by the Barker federal electorate committee could not have been better and is a credit to the hard working members of that FEC, and also acknowledges the respect and esteem in which they hold their federal member, Ian McLachlan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to acknowledge the help and advice from Senators Grant Chapman and Alan Ferguson, as well as my other federal and state colleagues. Without the encouragement of Senator Nick Minchin and Dorothy Kotz, I would not be in this chamber making this speech today. It was their encouragement that made me take the first step and stand for preselection, and I am grateful for their ongoing support and assistance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that my three sons are also here today. Christopher, Graham and Michael have had to come to terms with their mum being in Canberra, but I can say to my boys that what their mother hopes to achieve in this place is to secure a better Australia for them and their generation, which can provide a lifestyle and job opportunities to allow them to achieve their aspirations in the future. During the hectic days of the campaign, my seven&hyphen;year&hyphen;old son Michael asked me if I would come to school with him one particular morning. When I asked why, he said he wanted to take his mum to his class for show and tell because she was the candidate for Makin. It is always difficult as a parent juggling work commitments and family responsibilities. However, I felt most humbled, as children only ever want to show and tell their most precious treasures, and it was with great pride that I held my son's hand as he led me into his classroom.</PARA>

I hope that one day you will be able to realise your dreams of playing for one of the greatest football teams in the AFL, the Adelaide Crows. To my 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;old son Chris: for all the hard work you have done for your mum, the chores, the vacuuming, washing, ironing, dishes, cooking and feeding the pet yabbies&mdash;born during the campaign&mdash;and our other pets. All three of you have been terrific:  thank you for being here in the gallery today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me begin by congratulating the member for Makin (Mrs Draper) on her maiden speech. It is very pleasing that we have more women in the parliament, and it is particularly pleasing that we have women who are from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds. The honourable member asserted that she had a German background, and I am sure that will stand her in good stead in the discussion of many important issues in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that she mentioned the words `social justice' on a number of occasions in her speech. That is in great contrast to what the government said officially in the speech by the Governor&hyphen;General. If there is one thing that would strike anyone, especially anyone interested in the philosophical differences between the parties, it is the absence of any reference to social justice: the terms `social issues' and `social justice' are never used in the Governor&hyphen;General's speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a government claiming to be a government for all Australians, claiming to have an agenda, but the Governor&hyphen;General's speech, which must be one of the shortest Governor&hyphen;General's speeches in many years&mdash;certainly the shortest since I have been here in parliament, and that has been some time&mdash;had little substance about what the government was doing. It also failed to refer to a central part of the concerns of the Australian people, that is, all those questions on social justice. The term `social justice' was never used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not surprising if you analyse the document. Here is a new government: you would think that there would be a pronouncement of their philosophy, their direction, and what they are trying to do. But what do you find in this very thin document&mdash;the thinnest Governor&hyphen;General's statement for a long time? You find very little that gives us any indication of where they stand as a political party under John Howard as Prime Minister. That is not surprising because, if you follow the philosophy and the philosophical texts in relation to the pronouncements of John <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Howard&mdash;and much has been written about his pronouncements over the years&mdash;you become thoroughly confused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very hard to know where John Howard stands on the key issues. That is because he has changed his position so many times on these issues that it is hard for us to know where he is coming from and where he is going to. A while ago he described himself as the most conservative leader of the Liberal Party. What does that suggest? That suggests that in fact he is committed to the New Right, to the right wing, conservative extreme of the Liberal Party. That, in fact, was his position earlier on. Indeed, that was the position on which he went to the Australian people on a previous occasion when he was opposition leader and was defeated. The Australian people did not accept that New Right philosophy or that New Right direction which John Howard was propounding at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we ask the question, `Where is John Howard now?', it is very difficult to find an answer. Look at what he said in the election; look at the strategy that was employed in the election. That strategy is also being commented on by a number of people including a number of academics. The general strategy was to say, `There is not much in the platform and strategy of the Labor Party that we disagree with, only one or two issues. The general thrust is okay. It is just that we do not like the people managing it. We want to change them and we want to put ourselves in because we think we can do it better.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the impression which John Howard sought to create at that time. A lot of Australians voted the way they did because they were deceived by that. They were deceived into thinking that the old John Howard had disappeared. Even editorialists wrote on this issue. They said, `Let's forget and forgive John Howard on a range of issues. Let's forget about what he said about social questions. Let's forget about what he said about multiculturalism. Let's forget about what he said on immigration. Let's forget about what he said on Medicare because he has changed his position on all those issues.' We were led to believe that was the case.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2420">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened after the election? He had behind him a huge team of people but the people that he put in the key positions, the people that he put in the most prominent positions, the people that he put in control of economic policy positions in particular, were people committed to the same New Right direction which the Australian people had rejected in 1987, in 1990 and in 1993.</PARA>

Not very long after the election a myth was created about how the economy was in some dreadful crisis and therefore dramatic action had to be taken. But what kind of dramatic action was suggested? Is it a coincidence that the dramatic action that has been suggested is exactly the same prescription of the New Right which John Howard had said, and others around him and in the media had said, he had abandoned. It is the same prescription.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you about the key policies which have come out since the election which are exactly in line with this New Right philosophy and which, I might say, were tried with disastrous results by the Reagan administration in the United States and by the Thatcher administration in Britain. Those policies that we have heard about so far are nothing more than an attempt to go back on a commitment given in relation to a whole set of social, welfare, health and education services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you read this book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The New Right</EMPHASIS>, you see the first thing that they do in their philosophy is to come out and attack those services. Firstly they create a non&hyphen;existent problem and secondly they try to tell us that the only solution is exactly the same New Right philosophy which they tried to tell the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian people they were not going to pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This kind of deception will not go unchallenged. What does it betray? It betrays the fact that there are no new ideas at all in the Liberal and National parties. Listening to the speeches from the new members we heard some expressions of social justice and concern, but we heard no attempts to translate that into concrete policies. The first half of the new members' speeches would basically say, `We're concerned about aged care, we're concerned about education, we're concerned about this and we're concerned about that.' But in the second half of the speeches they all simply said that they supported the policy direction which was being pursued&mdash;policy which would undermine those programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In August, we will be facing a horror budget; a horror budget created not because of economic circumstances, but created because the Liberal Party is bereft of ideas and has simply gone in the same old tired New Right direction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for La Trobe has had not a new idea since Reagan, and he keeps padding out the same ones. The reality is that the New Right philosophy had a certain consequence in the United States and Britain. Its consequence was a huge increase in the gap between the rich and the poor. For the first time for many years in the United Kingdom, beggars appeared on the streets of London because people were cut off from support. The poor, the needy, the people who needed the programs the most, were left to fend for themselves. The safety net was reduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Margaret Thatcher would go into the British parliament and say, `This is all necessary.' She said it was necessary to create what she considered to be a good society. She left behind a shameful legacy. The same happened with Ronald Reagan's America. In the United States, even to this day, they have not been able to get through their legislature a bill to cover everybody with health insurance. If people become ill in the United States, they end up in a situation where it is very possible that they could lose their house and their savings in order to pay the health costs. That is a reality in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this country we have the Medicare system, which was brought in by the Labor government to cover every Australian and to ensure that everyone received social justice in relation to health. What happened? We were told by the conservatives before the election that they would not touch Medicare. What are we hearing now? According to various leaks, they will keep the word `Medicare', they will keep Medicare offices, but they will cut key aspects of the Medicare program. They are going to transfer&mdash;this is amazing&mdash;major health responsibilities to the states. In so doing, they will ensure a situation in which the states will not have enough money to pay for those health services, so the whole point of the Medicare system, especially in relation to public hospitals, will be undermined.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One reason why it is going down, sir, is because in the last few years we have had conservative governments in the states, and one of the areas which they have attacked is the school system. Look at Victoria, for example, where Jeff Kennett made huge cuts in the school system which resulted in its being unable to meet the basic needs of many children. We had a situation where we were starting to go backwards because of the state government's behaviour. That only reinforces the comments of the parliamentary secretary and reinforces my point. In this situation, when you shift responsibility to the states, you are going to have a nation in which there are differences between the different states in education, in health, in welfare and in housing, depending on the political will of the particular state government to implement an agenda. Instead of having the national government accepting responsibility for social justice, setting standards, ensuring that those standards are implemented and being ready to use its financial muscle, if necessary, to ensure those results, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2422"> we are going to have a situation in which all these responsibilities are handed back to the states. Money will be cut, and the consequence will be that those services will be reduced. We will start heading down the road which Britain and the United States took under the Thatcherite and Reaganite New Right policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people in the Liberal and National parties who have some concern, the thinkers&mdash;and there are some of them over there&mdash;and those who have been concerned to adopt some more progressive ideas, should come forward to the Prime Minister and the ministers and say, `We can't do this. We can't bring in this horror budget. We can't make cuts at such a level that people will really be hurt. We've got to do something else.' If they do not listen to that message it will not just be a question of politics, it will be a question of human suffering. People will suffer. There will be serious consequences. We will have problems in this country as a result of increasing poverty and the inequality that will come about from such measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not think that a cut of $8,000 million is going to be made without this sort of pain. Already it has become perfectly clear that the cuts are going to be in the programs which government delivers to the people in order to maintain social justice and in order to prevent inequality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast to all this, let me say that in each period of government the Labor Party sought to put into place a whole raft of social programs: programs that were designed to actually pursue the goal of social justice. We had in every budget a social justice statement. We pursued the agenda of social justice in a whole variety of areas. We put into place standards that we expected the states to reach, even when we had joint responsibilities. We were seeking to ensure that all people had at least basic access to and basic equity in these sorts of services. This question of access to and equity in services of this kind is going to set the political agenda of this country into the future. I can assure you of that. If the trend continues as it has up to this point, with the kind of policies that the opposition has already signalled, not only are we going to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> get this New Right ideological push in a very hard way, we are going to get people suffering as a result of that push.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is ready to support the government when it comes out with progressive policies and policies which are intended to help meet the needs of the people. It will not support programs that cut education and health and welfare and basic services to the Australian people.

A number of products have been developed. If these products have a potentially broader market, they will be commercialised to the advantage of all athletes and the AIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a recent innovation in the cycling area for the Australian cycling team. Many of our cyclists have done particularly well. We are looking forward to seeing how Kathy Watt goes at the Atlanta Games. A carbon fibre cycle frame with aerodynamic handlebars and forks has been refined since the 1994 Commonwealth Games. Following the Atlanta Games it is proposed to commercialise this cycle with a model being made available to the worldwide triathlete market. It will be available to all people and, I suppose one should say, we hope the parliament will acquire some in view of previous events in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIS has also developed a water rowing analysis system which provides coaches and athletes with realtime feedback on the forces on the oar throughout the stroke. This cutting edge development enables coaches to identify technique deficiencies and seat location in the rowing shell and to quantify the demands of rowing. Following Atlanta this is proposed to be commercialised. This is also another piece of unique equipment.</PARA>

A fluid replacement drink, Iso Sport, was developed for our athletes in association with an Australian company, Berrivale. Our athletes have benefited from it. This is also part of the commercialisation program and is available to the general population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work that has been undertaken by the AIS in the sports science area, both in terms of rowing equipment and the new carbon bicycle, is leading edge technology. If members of this House have the opportunity, I would invite them to take the time to go to the AIS sports medicine area and have a look at the developments. In that way they can do their bit to support the development of these world leading technologies and also extend their good wishes to the athletes, many of whom are preparing for Atlanta in a few weeks time.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because the Premier said so. Do you read the AAP wire or do you listen to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? If you read the AAP wire today, you will see that that is exactly what the Premier said. You were in this chamber yesterday reading out pre-prepared questions trying to put false implications and false information to the House. I would ask the people who wrote it for you whether they will give you an apology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it entirely clear: as we have said earlier, if any state wants to make a decision in relation to its taxation regime, that is a matter for that state. Those states running large surpluses, as Victoria is, will not be introducing taxes. The Premier indicated today that he would not, because he has a surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make this entirely clear: why was it necessary to renegotiate the real per capita guarantee? Because these people opposite had made a promise that they could not keep. You had said that you would pay $16 billion to the states. It was $16 billion you did not have. You would have had to have gone out to financial markets to borrow the money to give it to the states. Here were people running an $8 billion deficit promising money they did not have to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was the responsible government that said that there was no point in going out and paying money it did not have in the kick. It is an obvious point. I do not know how it eluded you. If you had been able to read the financial transactions, it would not have eluded you. You cannot pay out money you do not have.

<ANSWER PAGE="2425" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the member for Hughes, there has been considerable progress made in implementing the decision of the police ministers reached on 10 May. Yesterday the New South Wales Premier informed me that he anticipated the legislation giving effect to the prohibitions arising out of that meeting would be passed by the New South Wales parliament over the next few days. That is a course of action that was confirmed by the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, Mr Collins, who has given very strong support to the government of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday the Victorian lower house passed legislation extending the prohibitions announced at the police ministers conference. That legislation is now before the upper house in Victoria and the anticipation is that it will be passed through the upper house very shortly. The ACT Legislative Assembly has already passed the legislation to give effect to the police ministers' agreement. A new firearms bill will be introduced this week into the Tasmanian parliament to give effect to the legislation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2426">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian parliament, which I think most people would agree already had some laws that in many respects were tougher than laws in other parts of Australia, has proposed the circulation of a discussion paper with a view to the enactment of the amendments to give effect in August or September to the police ministers' decision. I am told that the situation in South Australia and the Northern Territory is that the necessary amendments there will also be enacted by August or September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Queensland there are two matters that have been the subject of some speculation in recent days and I want to take the opportunity of saying something about both of them. In relation to the so-called issue of crimping&mdash;which is a colloquial expression to describe the process whereby a weapon which has a capacity of more than two bullets is reduced by some process down to a weapon that has a capacity of only two bullets&mdash;it has been put by a number of people both in this parliament and around Australia that if there could be a process which was irreversible that converted the weapon's capacity from something above two bullets down to two bullets then that would come within the terms of the police ministers' resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the test is the test of irreversibility, and I think that is common ground. I think it was expressed very well on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program by the National Party whip and the member for Lyne, Mr Mark Vaile&mdash;it is a question of irreversibility. My view from the very beginning was that, if it is not irreversible, it cannot be within the spirit of the police ministers' decision and I would not support it. That remains my position and it remains the position of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is seeking the advice of ballistics experts, independent of the political process, as to whether or not that is possible, and we will act on that advice. I think there are people who genuinely believe that, if you can for all practical purposes make it irreversible, that is okay. I have to say that, unless it is, I am not prepared to support it. That is common ground in our ranks and I hope it would be common ground in the ranks of those opposite.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue surrounds the question of the category D weapons, which are the very high&hyphen;powered centre&hyphen;fire semiautomatic weapons. These were prohibited under the police ministers' resolution, except for the police, the armed forces and professional shooters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland government has raised the proposition&mdash;and there has been some misunderstanding about this&mdash;that in those cases where a farmer might have to deal, for example, with a feral pig problem and could not get access to a professional shooter whether there might be some temporary licensing of the primary producer as a professional shooter, including access for the period of the licence to a high&hyphen;powered weapon on the basis that that weapon, after the pigs have been exterminated, be returned to the police or some kind of central armoury. That is the proposition that has been put.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That matter is now being discussed between the federal government and the Queensland government. I want to say that I have some reservations about it and intend to have it very carefully examined. I am not giving it a tick but equally I am not rejecting it out of hand, because some people who have a very strong view on this subject argue that at least it ought to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition, very simply, is that there would be a limited licence for the duration of the problem and then the weapon would be handed back. That is going to be examined. I want to say to the House again that, unless I am satisfied that such a proposal complies with the spirit of what was agreed at the police ministers' conference, that proposal will not have my support. It is being examined and I do not want to reject it out of hand&mdash;but it will be very seriously examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, they are the two matters which are, as it were, outstanding. I want to renew to the House my personal commitment and that of the government to the implementation of the spirit and the letter of the police ministers' decision. It has not been easy. I appreciate the cooperation that has been given to the government by the Labor Party, and the cooperation that has been given around Australia by people on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2427"> both sides of politics. I appreciate the strongly held views of many decent, law&hyphen;abiding people; I do not take too much account of a few on the fringes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just say again that there is an inconvenience for some, which I apologise for, but there is a greater good to be served. I have no doubt in the world that, if the Australian people were given the opportunity to express a view on this matter, they would express it overwhelmingly in favour of what the government is proposing.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he could advise the House about the accuracy of recent reports of an imminent new military offensive by the PNG defence forces against the BRA in Bougainville as a result of continued internal conflict and the failure of the reconstruction process. Given Australia's long-term commitment to the wellbeing of the people of New Guinea, would the minister consult with the government of Papua New Guinea on ways by which the reconstruction process can be implemented and a permanent cease&hyphen;fire negotiated?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the right honourable member for his question. I have indeed seen indications that the Papua New Guinea government is planning a military offensive on Bougainville. As a consequence of those reports, I have instructed our high commissioner today to make representations to the Papua New Guinea government expressing the Australian government's concern about these reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can also inform the House, and in particular the right honourable member, who has such a great interest in the affairs of Papua New Guinea and Bougainville, that the high commissioner today will be meeting with Brigadier General Singirok, the Chief of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, and he will be expressing similar views at this meeting. When I visited Papua New Guinea on 2 to 4 May, I made it perfectly clear to Sir Julius Chan, the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, that I did not believe, and the Australian government does not believe, there is a military solution to the problems of Bougainville. The Australian government believes that the only practical solution is going to be a negotiated solution. That is a matter for the Papua New Guinea government and the various different interests in Bougainville to work through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In answer to the question of the right honourable member, the Australian government is always willing to play a part in assisting with this process, as indeed was the previous government. When I was in Papua New Guinea in May I made that point once more to Sir Julius Chan, and I offered <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2430"> Australia's help to try to reinvigorate the peace process, which broke down when the Papua New Guinea government formally lifted its cease&hyphen;fire in March this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Australian government always stands ready to assist the Papua New Guinea government and the people of Bougainville in this process. But I repeat: we do not believe there is a military solution to this problem. Indeed, if there is to be an attempt to achieve a military solution, it is my judgment and the judgment of the government that this will simply exacerbate the situation. The Australian government looks for a peaceful resolution of this matter. We look for a resumption of negotiations between the interested parties in Bougainville and the Papua New Guinea government, and that is the only solution there is to this problem.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports suggesting that banks may raise fees and charges on their deposit holders in the wake of recent cuts to home mortgage rates? What is the government's attitude to competition with regard to bank fees and charges? What action will the government take if there is evidence that unjustified fees and charges have been imposed on Australian consumers?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2431" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. As the House would know, the government has welcomed recent reductions in home variable mortgage rates which have been announced by major banks. Throughout the 1980s, banks and other deposit&hyphen;taking institutions enjoyed a considerable profit margin between their deposit&hyphen;taking cost of funds and their lending rates. This allowed a number of new entrants into the home mortgage market and, currently, around 100 mortgage managers are operating in Australia. Life insurance companies are also entering the market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of new entrants and heightened competition, we have seen a reduction in variable rates over the last couple of months. As a result of those recent reductions, however, there has been a focus on the question of whether banks would increase fees as a way of recouping the narrowing of the margin between their deposit&hyphen;taking and their lending activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I say in relation to fees as well, this government takes the view that red&hyphen;hot competition is the best way of having continual surveillance of financial institutions on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> each other in relation to fees, just as it is the first and best port of call in relation to interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The notion that competition is the most effective way to generate benefits for consumers is not new. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, in its 1991 report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A pocketful of change</EMPHASIS>, came to the same conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing the benefit of competition in rates. This government wants to see the benefit of competition in fees as well. If there is any suggestion of anti&hyphen;competitive activity or collusion in fees and charges, the government does have the option of referring the matter to the relevant body, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. And we will take that action if necessary, or if any information arises of inadequate competition in that area of products as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's inquiry into the financial system is an inquiry designed to enhance competition and improve regulatory arrangements. We believe that, as a consequence of that, we will facilitate increased competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me make it clear: as far as this government is concerned, increased competition is always directed at consumer benefit. The consumer benefit is the end result and competition is the means of getting there.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have the perfect opportunity to renege on our obligations under the GATT. . . </PARA>
<PARA>In effect, he said we have that opportunity in certain circumstances. That is an extraordinary statement. I would like to ask some of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposition frontbench whether they endorse that statement or whether they have now gone down the path of losing all trade credibility and all policy integrity, and are now into policy duplicity. This has acutely embarrassed the member for Canberra and will acutely embarrass the member for Perth when he gets around to making a statement on trade policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That statement does not reflect our true interests because we are about a hard&hyphen;edged trade policy which is about better access for our exporters and about delivering on the Uruguay Round outcomes which include&mdash;for the member for Hunter's information&mdash;a billion dollar increase in agricultural export access and a cut of more than 50 per cent on average tariffs faced by Australia's exporters in the manufacturing sector. It also involves an improvement in the critical area of coal exports, something which I would have thought the member for Hunter would be interested in, as well as an agreement on services which ensures that Australia's service providers receive the same treatment as their international competitors.</PARA>

That letter was inaccurate and, at that stage, I told the House that we were not going to close that office. However, my attention has been drawn to an interview given subsequently on 2NC by the honourable member for Newcastle in which he claimed he had proof that the government was planning to close the DAS office in Newcastle in the next month.

Frankly, I think his actions are appalling and he should apologise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the honourable member has been outdone by one of his colleagues.

What is proposed in the area&mdash;it is now well under way&mdash;is to repair part of our damaged environment. There is a $1.1 million program to rehabilitate a dump site adjacent to the plant, which involves about 3.5 hectares of artificial wetlands. About 10,000-odd trees have been planted there, as has a whole range <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of new grasses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I acknowledge the long interest the member for Hinkler has had in quality training for young people through the group training schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to inform the House that the states and territories, through the Australian National Training Authority ministerial council, have unanimously endorsed the objectives and the key principles of the government's modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system. They have endorsed in principle also the processes and the mechanisms for implementing this very positive reform initiative which is going to deliver real job opportunities to young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth is going to be working closely with the states&mdash;and that is all the states; New South Wales, I am pleased to say, has seen the sense of the proposals that the government is putting forward and has come in behind it on this issue&mdash;and territories over the coming months to deliver training arrangements which lead to real jobs and which genuinely meet the training needs of small and medium sized businesses in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is needed is not the kind of training that we have seen over recent years where there has been a political agenda to hide and redefine the unemployed, but quality training which is seen and recognised by the hundreds of thousands of small businesses in this country to contribute directly to their bottom line, to their productivity and to their competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make sure that this happens, the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system will be an industry-led system which will modernise apprenticeship and training arrangements, and significantly expand quality job-related training. It will cut through the excessive regulation and bureaucracy which tied the previous government's training arrangements up in knots. It will expand <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2436"> quality training opportunities for women and it will be focused on the regional and local levels within a national framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's training reforms are designed to re&hyphen;establish pathways to employment, particularly for that 30 per cent of young people who do not complete their schooling through to year 12, as well for those who do manage to complete 12 years of schooling. We will be working very closely with the states to expand the opportunities for vocational education in the senior secondary years and, in particular, to give young people the opportunity to work partly in the workplace, to be employed there and to earn wages while they are doing so, while completing studies of both a vocational and general character at school.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. I dare say that it was predictable enough that this question would come along today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anybody has managed to get it wrong for the industry, for the investment in it, for the jobs and for the environment, it was you after 10 years of fooling around with forest policy. If there is anybody who knows anything about clear&hyphen;felling, it is you because you are the great clear&hyphen;feller of political standards in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just make a couple of other points. We talk about getting it right. Of course I am aware of the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act, especially as they happen to relate to the making of regulations similar to disallowed regulations. I am fully aware of that. I can assure the House that any new arrangements that we seek to put in place will be done in full accordance with the law. It is pure and simple&mdash;there is no problem. The fact is that I gave notice of motion to disallow because if I had not done so the options available to us to clean up the unbelievable mess that you left us would have been significantly closed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other thing I want to say is that, unlike you mob, on this one, we as a government can work together for sensible outcomes, not only in terms of our interaction with industry and the environment movement and all of those other desirable objectives but with ourselves as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question and acknowledge his commitment to the health of the population in his former role as the President of the AMA. I want to answer the second part of the member's question first. Let me assure the honourable member that this government is fully committed to ensuring that the health services which veterans and their dependants receive are of the highest quality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One aspect of hospital care that has been causing some concern, particularly among elderly veterans, is the services provided on their discharge from hospital&mdash;services which should be provided to ensure that veterans have the quickest and fullest recovery. To improve services offered to veterans on their discharge from hospital, the government has developed an education package for the veteran community and hospitals. The package provided to veterans emphasises the importance of veterans participating in their own discharge planning so that they understand what they can do and what they can ask others to do so that they enjoy a very smooth recuperation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the end of the month, all veterans will be receiving a copy of the information package designed especially for them. The common aim of this two&hyphen;pronged approach is to ensure better discharge planning for the veteran community and to ensure as far as possible the good health of veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the first part of the question, I want to canvass the issue of the Lady Davidson hospital. As another element of our commitment to the health and wellbeing of the veteran community, we are currently considering the future of Lady Davidson Repatriation Hospital in Sydney. It is the last of the repatriation hospitals still operating under the Commonwealth government. A decision on its future, let me assure the House, will be based solely on determining the best way to deliver quality health care service to veterans and war widows. I have prepared an options paper which I am currently circulating to the ex&hyphen;service community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will not be rushed on this decision. We will not be taking the approach of the Labor health minister in New South Wales, Dr Refshauge, who disgracefully and wrongly used Anzac Day this year to scare the ex&hyphen;service community when he said that the Commonwealth government was considering options which would increase health costs to veterans. Not only did he use Anzac Day to raise that issue but he was wrong when he said that he had done a deal with the previous Commonwealth government. He was wrong; he knows he was wrong. The previous <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2438"> government had not done a deal on the future of Lady Davidson hospital. There was no such agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not be rushed into a decision on Lady Davidson hospital. Dr Refshauge ought to heed the advice of the New South Wales RSL president, Mr Rusty Priest. I will quote his comments from the newspaper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My message to Dr Refshauge is to stop scaring the veterans and wait until the options are looked at.</PARA>
<PARA>It appears that it is not only Dr Refshauge who is scaring the veterans; it is the shadow minister over there, as the House was alerted to yesterday on the matter of sales tax. He has not come into the House yet and corrected the record. Quite clearly, the signature on that letter is, in fact, his signature. The government is committed to the health and wellbeing of the veteran community. We will not be rushed into a decision on Lady Davidson Repatriation Hospital; we will be discussing the issue with the ex&hyphen;service community and we will make sure that the proper process is put in place.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a few members of the government still in the chamber today. How many will still have smiles on their faces come 20 August, when this government intends to cut the rebates which are provided to Australians for their Medicare treatment? We will see how many of them have smiles on their faces when the government introduces the legislation to cut the rebates which are paid to Australian families when they go to see their doctors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we have every right to be upset is that before the election specific promises were given to the Australian people. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised to retain Medicare. The Prime Minister promised to retain bulkbilling. The minister at the table, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), gave personal undertakings to the people who live in his electorate. I will quote from a letter sent to the residents of Box Hill South on 21 February. Box Hill is a very famous place for the Australian Labor <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2440"> Party; it is where John Howard fell apart in his campaign to be Prime Minister in 1987. In a letter from the minister for health on 21 February to the residents of his own electorate he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Present Medicare rebates will not be changed.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to give this personal undertaking:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which subsidises the cost of many vital drugs, will be retained.</PARA>
<PARA>So they were the promises and commitments given by no less than the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services&mdash;that there would be no cuts to Medicare rebates. Those were the promises made before the election. What has happened since? An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph </EMPHASIS> headed `The $5 Medi fee' says that the bulk&hyphen;billing pledge is in doubt over cost cuts. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS>  of 23 April is headed `Minister silent on Medicare'. That was when the minister for health refused to give his state colleagues an assurance that there would not be the introduction of a compulsory patient fee for visits to the doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 17 June states `Medicare promise wavers'. That was in response to the minister's remarks recently on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Face to Face</EMPHASIS> program. In last Sunday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS>, under the headline `Up up up' there was the very clear statement that the government intends to increase the cost of visiting your doctor by $6 to $10. On the front page there is a photo of the Prime Minister sipping chardonnay, just to make the point about the extent to which he is caring about the promises he made on these issues before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that we are so determined to keep this government honest on the promises they made before the election is that the Prime Minister has set a very high standard on these issues. We all remember during the last parliament he set a high personal standard for people like the former minister for health. At that time he said the following things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want to assert the very simple principle that truth is absolute&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this was said by John Howard, the current Prime Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life.</PARA>
<PARA>So we make the simple point that if truth is absolute, if truth is supreme, if truth is not disposable in national public life, then the minister for health cannot dispose of truth in national public life in his role not just as the minister for health but as the member for Chisholm. He cannot simply dispose of the promises, the personal undertakings, which he gave to the residents of Box Hill when he wrote to them promising that Medicare rebates would not be cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt in a few minutes the minister will come to the dispatch box and say that, no matter what promises were made before the election, he and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) have been shocked to discover that there is a much bigger deficit than the Liberal Party expected when they were making their promises throughout the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think most Australians are becoming tired of governments claiming that, once they get elected and open the cupboard, shock and horror, they find that the cupboard is bare and they have to ditch all their election promises. I think the Australian people should adopt this attitude: every time they hear a Liberal claim that there is a much bigger deficit than they expected, they should expect to hear another Liberal explaining and excusing why they are breaking the promises they made to the Australian people. They will be using that and other excuses to try to explain why they are undermining Medicare, why they are undermining bulk&hyphen;billing, why they are going to cut the Medicare rebates, why they are going to disrupt the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole reason is based on this bogus cutback, this bogus deficit. We all know the real reason why they are going through this process of cutting back government programs. It is to pay for the $4 billion of unfunded election promises that John Howard and the minister for health made at the last election. I think we all have to try to make sure that everything is done to keep the minister for health and the Prime Minister to the promises they made before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2441"> It has been quite interesting to watch the way in which various members of the govern ment, and the minister at the table in particular, have twisted and turned on these issues. We saw very early in the piece the minister at the table meeting with the Australian Medical Association and floating a proposal with the Australian Medical Association to introduce a compulsory patient fee. We saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph </EMPHASIS>under the headline `The $5 Medi fee' the following article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bulk&hyphen;billing pledge in doubt over cost cuts. Patients would have to pay a fee of between $2 and $5 every time they see a doctor under a change to Medicare being considered by the Federal Government. Health Minister Michael Wooldridge met the AMA, radiologists and other doctors groups this week and told them the payment was an option for saving about $500 million.</PARA>
<PARA>So at the first meeting that the minister for health has with the AMA he tells them that this is an option to which he is giving serious consideration. But, within 24 hours, the Prime Minister jumped in. Actually, he sent his media adviser and press secretary to the press gallery to try to talk the journalists out of running this story. In fact, the Prime Minister gave certain assurances to the journalists that the government would not be introducing that co&hyphen;payment. It was run under the headline `Medi retreat'. I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This move was a rebuff to the health minister, Dr Wooldridge, who told doctors last Wednesday that the co&hyphen;payment was a serious option for saving $500 million.</PARA>
<PARA>Having let the health minister go out and tell the AMA that this was a serious proposal, the Prime Minister pulls the rug out from under him and says that no further consideration will be given to it. Yet, when the opposition raises the issue in the parliament to seek an assurance from the Prime Minister or the minister that there will not be a compulsory patient fee for visits to the doctor, they refuse to rule it out. When we ask them to give an assurance that the cost of pharmaceutical services will not be increased, as suggested in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Herald Sun</EMPHASIS>  under the headline `Bitter pill for the elderly', Gerard McManus ran a story that suggested that the government was considering a proposal and that the minister for health's own department and the Department of Finance were looking at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increasing the cost of pharmaceuticals for pensioners and general patients. The article suggests that pensioners will have to pay $4 for each prescription, up from $2.50, while the general public will have to pay up to $20 a script, up from the current $16.20.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we asked the minister to rule that out, the minister refuses to do it, the Prime Minister refuses to do it. Is it any wonder that we have concerns about what they might really be up to? It is no secret as to what the Prime Minister's real views are on Medicare. If you go back to the last occasion when John Howard wanted to be the Prime Minister of Australia, he let us know his real views on Medicare. I quote from what he said in 1986:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare has been an unmitigated disaster.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Lindsay is right&mdash;average families would be hardest hit if Medicare rebates were cut. The elderly and the chronically ill would also be badly hit. That is why we are so concerned about the proposals that are floating around at the moment. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS>  says that the minister has got a plan to cut Medicare rebates for a visit to a GP by five per cent and to cut the rebates for visits to a specialist by 10 per cent. Some people might think, `A five per cent reduction in the Medicare rebate for a visit to the GP is only a cut of $1.20.' Most people in the gallery today would think that, because their GP bulk&hyphen;bills, they currently see the GP for free and that, if they have got to pay $1.20, that is something they might be able to afford. But what they do not understand is that doctors have made it clear in every survey that has been done that, if the rebate is reduced five per cent, from 85 per cent to 80 per cent&mdash;even if it is only $1.20&mdash;the majority of GPs will no longer bulk&hyphen;bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in the gallery may not know that the AMA's recommended fee for a visit to the GP is $34. The reduction of $1.20 that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister is planning does not mean that you will be paying $1.20 to see the GP&mdash;you will have to pay up to $34 when you see the GP. You will get your rebate from Medicare, but you will still be about $15 out of pocket. Every time you or your child needs to see the GP you will be up for $34 up&hyphen;front instead of being treated free of charge by being bulk&hyphen;billed. Even after the Medicare rebate you will be $15 out of pocket. If the average person visits a doctor 10 times a year, that is $150 for every member of every family&mdash;quite a substantial impost on the average Australian family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for these reasons, we believe, that any cuts in the Medicare rebate will hit the elderly, the chronically ill and young families the hardest. That is why we are going to hold this minister to the promises that he made to the people in his electorate before the last election. We are going to make sure that this minister is held accountable for the personal undertakings which he gave to the residents of Box Hill and to the other residents in his electorate. If this minister has been rolled by the ERC and is forced to break his promise to the electors of Chisholm by cutting back the Medicare rebates, he will be placed in an untenable position. If this minister has been rolled by the ERC and has to cut back Medicare rebates, he will be responsible for breaking his promise to his own constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has happened before. When the former member for Barton, Gary Punch, was placed in a similar position he resigned. He was a minister. He knew the honourable thing to do when he had to break his personal undertakings to his own electors. If, on 20 August, this minister is responsible for any cutbacks in the Medicare rebates he will have broken his undertaking. He will have broken the pledge that he made with his own hand to the electors of Box Hill South and the other people who live in his electorate. On 20 August this minister will have to face up to the decisions that are being made by the ERC&mdash;of which he is a member&mdash;and we are determined to make sure that he is held accountable. We are determined to make sure that the Australian people keep Medicare, do not have their Medicare rebates cut and do <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2443"> not have the cost of their pharmaceuticals undermined by a wholesale transfer of these responsibilities to the states.</PARA>

I would like to say a few things about what the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), said because the hypocrisy index in this place is getting a little bit high.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be judged at the end of three years on the whole content of our health policy and what we have been able to deliver. The shadow minister should not get too worked up speculating about what might happen in the budget, because in the end this is all speculation. All that is coming from this side is what comes from the government before every budget: that is, we refuse to rule things in or out. There is nothing exceptional or unusual about this. In fact, before the last budget the then Leader of the Government in the Senate and now shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), in response to a question in another place said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to suggest that the government is going to introduce any new taxes . . . is nothing more than budget speculation and obviously neither I nor anybody else is going to be in the business of confirming or denying any particular element of budgetary speculation, not because to do so would be to reveal anything about that particular proposal, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but to do so on any individual item immediately raises questions about multiple others and puts you into an impossible situation.</PARA>
<PARA>If the shadow minister were a new member of parliament he would have some reason for making this sort of mistake, but the fact is that, as a former cabinet minister, he knows very well that what he is saying is complete humbug and no more than budget speculation. On budget night he is going to look pretty stupid when we put back to him some of the scares that he was running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before you start making these sorts of allegations you want to be fairly careful about your own party's track record. I have a copy of the Labor Party's 1993 health policy. It makes fairly interesting reading. Look at the things we were expecting to get from the Labor Party government between 1993 and 1996: `1. New initiatives in the private sector to reduce waiting lists.' The money was never spent. `2. Private hospitals will be included in health services regional planning.' Never happened. `3. The aged care industry will review and examine the adequacy of nursing staff to meet the increasing dependency of those living in hostels.' Never happened. `4. A national rural health program will focus on expanding the rural health centres initiative.' Never happened. `5. Access to Medicare rebates for bone densimetry for women at risk of developing osteoporosis.' It was never introduced for screening. `6. Establishment of a national health promotion authority.' Never done. `7. Legislation reform to the National Health Act will ensure Australia's commitment to the promotion of health.' The legislation never appeared. `8. Provision of language services in public hospitals.' Never done. `9. Establishment of a national advisory council on ethnic health.' Never materialised. `10. Continuation of the national mental health strategy.' It was axed the next year. `11. Development of a national primary health care policy.' It was never done. `12. A national environmental health strategy.' It never appeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have only read from pages 3 and 4. Do not give us any humbug about what might or might not happen in the budget. You will be condemned by what you failed to achieve, in terms of your measures, just in your last term <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2444"> of government. Give me a couple more weeks and we will work back on the promises that were made in your previous terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was hoping that this debate would be more about the very serious issue of the possibility of reforming health and aged care as outlined in the matter of public importance which appeared before me. I want to spend a few minutes informing the House about what is happening there and of its importance to Australia because this is one of the more exciting prospects that the country has faced in terms of health and aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I start, let me put on the record two points raised by the previous minister for health. The first is from a speech she gave last year to the 1995 national Divisions of General Practise Forum. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know the Council of Australian Governments is exploring reforms to the Australian health care system, including arrangements for the better integration and coordination of care. While our system services the bulk of the community quite well, we all know that some people, because of the complexity or intensity of their needs, don't get the help they need when they need it. The needs of these people and the problems they face are a key concern to me. We have to break out of the straightjacket of historical boundaries and assumptions about what is a state or Commonwealth responsibility, what is the health or community services responsibility and deal with people on the basis of their individual needs. There is, in fact, a lot that could be done by reviewing the way we do things and approaching reform of the basis of what's best for the client.</PARA>
<PARA>She also talked about the COAG reforms in this House on 28 March 1995. In answer to a question she berated the opposition by stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope members of the opposition will encourage their colleagues in the conservative states to participate in the COAG discussion next week. In that discussion we have an opportunity to look at these responsibilities, to look at the cost&hyphen;shifting questions and to focus, for the first time in a while when it comes to some of the state governments, on the quality of patient care. The COAG discussions will enable us, I think for the first time in a while, to ensure that, when it comes to hospital funding, community funding, Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits, we have a genuinely national health system. As I must say it is quite clear that members opposite have no interest in this matter, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I presume we will have to conduct the debate without their support.</PARA>
<PARA>In the lead&hyphen;up to the last election, I could have, as shadow minister, been highly critical of those COAG proposals. I could have whipped up misinformation as to what they might have done, but I chose not to, at some personal cost to me before the election. The reason I did that was that I actually believed these were in the nation's interest. I did not want to be accused of hypocrisy by criticising something like this before the election and then trying to implement it afterwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition took a sceptical role, I might say, but we were positive. We did not whip up fear. We did not rule it out. The fact is that, since the election, even if you do not believe the New South Wales Minister for Health who at the last federal&hyphen;state health ministers' meeting said on this issue, `We have managed to move this more in the last two months than we have in the last two years', Australia's health system does work quite well for the majority of people, but there are some real problems that we have to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give examples of some of those problems. We have rigid programs and there are gaps between those programs and a lot of people fall through those gaps. An example is palliative care. Western Australia has one of the best home based systems of palliative care anywhere in Australia. It is run by an organisation called Silver Chain. Silver Chain can look after someone in the last days of their life at home for an average cost of about $50 a day. The majority of people who are dying would actually like to die at home if they could get the backup and support they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 Silver Chain calculated the number of people it had to send to Western Australian public hospitals to die for no other reason than the money they could spend under the federal government's home and community care program had run out. Some 4&half; thousand public hospital bed days were used by people who had been sent to public hospitals to die. Rather than have someone where they wanted to be, at home, at a cost of $50 a day, people were dying where they did not want to be, in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2445"> hospitals, at the cost of $500 a day. This is because of the rigidities in Commonwealth-state programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example was given to me by the CEO of a health care network in Victoria who said to me a little while ago, `We've got our hospital beds down in this area to below two per thousand of the population. We should be doing that because they are expensive. But I can't get my beds down any lower because I can't provide the backup in the community needed to backup the early discharge.' One is a state government program and the other is a federal government program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important issue. This morning I released the biannual survey of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Health 1996</EMPHASIS>. One of the things it showed is that, by international standards, we still have a very high level of hospital beds&mdash;but we do not have the good community care to back it up, and that leads to an expensive health system. This also manifests itself in other simple ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 75,000 people in Australian nursing homes. There are another 75,000 who are sick enough to be in a nursing home but are being looked after by their families&mdash;my grandmother is one of them. For very elderly frail people often the real crunch point comes when they become incontinent. The family then has to provide another $2,500 to $3,000 a year for incontinence products to keep the person at  home. We cannot help them. If they cannot afford to pay $2,500 to $3,000 a year to keep the person at home, we put them in a nursing home at $32,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the sorts of rigidities that are bedevilling the Australian health care system and change is going to be difficult. I do not know if we will be successful, quite frankly. But I am prepared to give it a go because I believe that it is incredibly in the national interest and incredibly in the public's interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Negotiating with the states is always devilishly hard. But we are prepared to try, and we have had very great success by getting the states and territories to the point of being prepared to sign up. This is not handing over health in a wholesale manner to the states; we are simply not going to do that. It is trying to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> understand the roles and responsibilities, and they are different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has a responsibility for health&mdash;and it will not walk away from it. But that responsibility does not mean that the Commonwealth should be delivering the services as well as putting rigid boundaries around its programs so that, on the ground, people fall through the gaps. When it comes to roles: yes, we will be offering the states more flexibility; we will be offering the states the capacity to fill in the gaps in their programs and meet their needs, because they are different. Different states have different cultures, different histories, different strengths and different weaknesses. But the Commonwealth will not be walking away from its responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian health care system is also bedevilled by cost shifting. The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne alone has 60 doctors running so-called privatised outpatient clinics. St Vincents Hospital in Melbourne is looking to hand over its casualty department holus-bolus to private doctors so that it can shift the cost from the state government to us. I am not trying to single out Victoria; every state in Australia is pretty much as bad as the other. But this is probably adding $350 million to $400 million of costs per year to the Medicare budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member opposite, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), knows, having sat through government and knowing what the ERC is like, when one part of my program is going out of control in a very big way because the states are shifting costs, that chews up what I can do in public health, such as immunising our kids, in Aboriginal health, and in maternal and child health. We have to address this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the best and brightest minds in Australia not trying to work out how we can provide additional services to an ageing population, not trying to work out how with new technology we can meet the needs of the people, not trying to work out how we can do things better, but trying to work out how we can shift costs from one level of government to another. As I have said before, it is inefficient and it does not meet people's needs. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2446"> That is what we are trying to do through the COAG process. As I say, I fully accept that we may not succeed&mdash;but I will certainly try.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, we do have a tough budget. The last thing I expected was to spend the first three months in government totally consumed by meeting after meeting, trying to find savings to meet a budget deficit figure. I would like to know where the figure came from too, but I have to accept that the figures come from Treasury and they are the figures we work on. If you look at the government revenue figures coming through, they probably will be about right. In the end, we were elected to do a job and make tough decisions. I will do that within the framework of health, trying to make a contribution to those savings&mdash;because I should not be immune from that. But in the end, rather than getting on with public health programs, getting on with things in Aboriginal health, getting on with things in maternal and child health, because of the legacy we have inherited, I have been totally consumed with trying to find savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not particularly happy about it. I will make no apologies to my electorate. I will do an honest and decent job. In the end my constituents will judge me, as they do every time, at a federal election. That is what democracy is about, and I will be very happy in 2&half; to three years time to stand on my record.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) in expressing the concern and, I might I add, confusion that is currently widespread in the community. This concern and confusion has been caused, I have to say, by the government's failure to rule out cuts to Medicare rebates and its plans for the wholesale transfer of health and aged care programs to the states. I would say in response to some of the comments the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) just made that reform is fine. In fact, we believe in good <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reform. But we do not believe in it if it is only budget driven.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the comments made by the minister a moment ago reflect the concerns of many people in the community; there is no doubt about that. But cutting in dollar terms will not address that concern. When you talk about states and territories cost shifting, how on earth will they handle that when you give them the whole responsibility for providing health care for the aged and the community in general? How will they handle that when they are already having problems? I really think we need to look in far more detail at what you will do when you hand these programs over to the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has canvassed the option of a co-payment of up to $5 a visit on top of the present consultation fee; visits to bulk-billing doctors are free. The minister has refused to promise that the government will not introduce an up-front fee for going to the doctor. He says, `I'm not going to rule anything in or out.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comments have been made in this House today that we are scaremongering. We are not. We are purely saying that the constituency&mdash;the community out there&mdash;are hearing what the government is saying and they are worried. The pre&hyphen;election commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was that the coalition would fully retain the Medicare system and bulk billing and community rating. But we are not hearing statements to reinforce that now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Doctors Reform Society has branded any sort of additional payment as a tax on the sick. Dr Con Costa from the Doctors Reform Society said the proposal would spell the end of bulk billing and the poorest of families would be hit the hardest. Again that is flying in the face of any coalition commitment during the campaign. The president of the Australian Association of General Practitioners, Mike Jones, has said that urgent action is needed to protect Australia's needy from having to pay any further up&hyphen;front fee if they see a GP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government is considering several cost&hyphen;cutting moves, including a proposal for an overall reduction in the current GP <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2447"> Medicare rebate of $20.85 a visit. Mr Jones is deeply worried because many bulk billing GPs had warned that, if the federal government went ahead with these moves, they would be forced to charge pensioners and low income earners up&hyphen;front fees. This is ridiculous. You cannot possibly have that sort of thing intimated by a government and not have people worried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to spend some time talking specifically about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The government's plan to force the states and territories to take over the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is a disaster for patients, particularly those in the smaller states and territories. The current system provides all Australians with equal access to drugs. The government is proposing to remove this equality of access and abandon its responsibility to the whole community to ensure that every Australian has equal access to health services. It has been said by many people, particularly the president of the Pharmaceutical Guild of Australia, that we have in the PBS scheme the best scheme in the world. Why on earth would we wish to tamper with it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government's plan to hand over the responsibility for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which was flagged at last week's meeting of the Council of Australian Governments, is a medical equivalent of abolishing the standard gauge of railways. It is a very good analogy. Having taken 150 years to link the mainland capitals with a standard gauge railway link, the coalition wants to celebrate that by creating eight different pharmaceutical systems. It is madness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is competition gone mad to allow each state and territory government to decide basically which drugs will be available in their state or territory and how much each patient will have to pay. Apart from the additional cost of duplicating approval processes in each state and territory, the government's plan means that some drugs will be available in some states and territories but not in others. In Australia, patients will not accept&mdash;neither should they even have to think about it&mdash;that their address will deter mine which drug their doctor can prescribe for them or their family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Health and Family Services claims that this will encourage what he calls `complete federalism'. In reality, it will be competition that rewards those states and territories which hit patients with the highest fee for their medication. This form of competition would really hurt the people in my electorate because the ACT simply does not have the necessary market power to compete with the larger states, such as New South Wales or Victoria, for proper supply deals with the drug companies. Let's face it: that is what it is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's plan would hit the elderly, younger families and the chronically ill the hardest. I have been approached by a number of constituents who are extremely concerned about the financial impact this sort of decision would have on their weekly budget, let alone on their health. It is not only this side of the House that is against these proposals. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia has also come out and attacked very publicly and very strongly the minister's plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I share equal concern about the issue of aged care. I express my very strong concern at the approach this government is taking to aged care, like many others. My concern is shared. The Australian Council of Social Service, the Catholic Social Welfare Commission, the Salvation Army and the Australian Psychiatric Disability Coalition and many others all believe the current indication of policy direction in this area is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that handing over all Commonwealth responsibility in this matter to the states and territories will result in a better outcome for carers or for those receiving care. There certainly will not be a better outcome in my electorate of Namadgi, particularly given the current climate of significantly reduced Commonwealth funding to the ACT and the ACT Liberal government's very lacklustre approach to the provision of social services. Specifically, with aged care locally, we have seen the ACT Liberal government sell off the local nursing home, Jindalee, to private interests because it said it could not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2448"> afford to run the nursing home and did not want to be bothered with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also in relation to nursing home care, an elderly lady constituent, who is a self&hyphen;funded retiree, approached me last Friday. Her husband is a sufferer of dementia and is in a nursing home receiving very good care. She exists financially because of the $80 subsidy currently paid by government for the care of that man in that nursing home bed. She came to see me because of the rumours in the community that there may be some eroding of that $80 subsidy. Whether or not it is intended, for heaven's sake, tell these people what you intend to do. This woman is not sleeping. She is terribly worried her financial security is at risk. I deplore a government that allows that sort of insensitivity to the community to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge for government at all levels is to get out there and promote the variety of aged care services that are available. It is not good enough for this government to fob off its responsibilities to the states and territories, cross its fingers and hope it works. However, the government seems intent on handing back the responsibility for a wide range of health and community services to the states and territories, irrespective of the damage it will cause to access and equity. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear that the devolution of power will not be matched by the devolution of resources. The states and territories will not be able to maintain present service levels, let alone improve them. We could all agree, with the increasing statistical evidence in front of us about the growth of our older community, that we need to continue to improve these services. I think at the moment we are running the risk of holding the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the election, the then opposition&mdash;now the government&mdash;were claiming that funding to the states would be maintained. However, the story has changed now that they have to find ways to meet their $4 billion pre-election commitments. Consequently, the states and territories have had their funding significantly cut. If the states and territories are now passed the responsibility for the provision of aged care&mdash;let alone any other area&mdash;they will inevitably be forced to allow <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the quality and standard of service to slip. Need I remind the House that the reason the Commonwealth became involved in aged care in the beginning was that the states and territories were either unable or unwilling to provide assured quality services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ultimate outcome of this coalition policy will be greater inequalities in access to services, particularly in remote or impoverished areas. This is in marked contrast to the record of the former Labor government, where access to aged care was an equal right across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the coalition's proposals would encourage profit making at the expense of universal service provision. I fear it would be the policy of this government to encourage aged care providers to cater for the wealthier end of the market at the expense of the more needy. This is a situation that those on this side of the House view as a great step backwards in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If my words do not flow freely in speaking to this MPI, it is because I find it very difficult to restrain myself. I was under the impression that this matter of public importance was to discuss the speculation in the press about Medicare rebates, the government's plans for health and aged care programs and the possible transfer of those programs to the states. So important did the opposition consider this MPI debate, the most they could muster was three members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past 13 years, you could have opened a newspaper or turned on a television or radio on any day of the week and read or heard about the problems in the health care system&mdash;about waiting lists, bed closures, theatre closures, people on trolleys, problems with aged care and so on. Every quarter the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia publishes a survey which is conducted for them by the Morgan research and polling group. The survey that was done prior to this year's change of government found that 45 per cent of Australians believed the Australian health care system was getting worse; 52 per cent said they had not been consulted about it; 62 per cent said they would like to be consulted about it; and over 63 per cent said they had <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2449"> absolutely no confidence in the then federal government to manage health care. Further to that, 53 per cent thought the Australian public hospital system was in crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent survey, which involved 1,500 interviews conducted Australia&hyphen;wide between 3 and 7 May, found that 86 per cent of Australians fear that they may not have access to adequate public health services when they grow older and as the health needs of Australia's ageing population increase; 82 per cent are concerned about whether the health care system can be adequately funded in the future using the current funding arrangements; 68 per cent believe that the public health system will be unable to meet the demand for health services; and 52 per cent would not be happy to rely solely on Medicare for hospital services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of Medicare rebates, what the Australian government and the opposition need to understand is that in the last three years we have averaged 5&half; per cent real growth in Medicare outlays. Yet in last year's budget we found that there was going to be an 11.7 per cent increase in administrative costs for the Department of Health and Family Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the period from 1985 to 1995, in general we had a 62 per cent increase in the consumer price index and a 60 per cent increase in average weekly earnings, but the Medicare benefits&mdash;for which the previous government was responsible&mdash;increased by a miserable 35.5 per cent. In other words, the level of Medicare benefits was increasing at a rate barely half that of the consumer price index. In fact, the 1990&hyphen;91 Auditor-General's report No. 32 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no longer any understandable or transparent mechanism for indexing the Medicare benefit schedule. It is set entirely by the government, having regard only for its budgetary and economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>On the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  is a story stating that the lawyers representing the former health minister and member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) have put a case to the present Attorney-General (Mr Williams) saying that $250,000 should be provided for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legal expenses in relation to the Marks royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) that $250,000 would feed every resident in every privately run nursing home in Australia for one year&mdash;that is 62,500 of them. That amount of money would pay for the management and confinement of 400 pregnancies at the Medicare benefit schedule level; it would pay for 6,000 general practitioners to get out of bed in the middle of the night and go and see people who are sick; it would immunise 12,500 babies; and it would return the sight to 350 blind Aborigines. So, if you want to talk about Medicare rebates, I will have a talk about them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of pharmaceuticals, the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis)&mdash;and so concerned was she that she has now left the chamber, but at least she might be able to read about this in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;talked about equal access to drugs and pharmaceuticals. May I remind the member for Dobell&mdash;given that he is new to the health area&mdash;that, when Paul Keating was the Treasurer of Australia, he introduced a then $2.50 payment for pensioners and unemployed people for the most important drugs that they need. When he introduced that, Keating said, `Anything that is free leads to overuse.' I might also remind the House about the $200 door handles as well as the mahogany toilet seats&mdash;although I cannot put a value on them&mdash;in the Phillip Street ministerial offices in Sydney that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) has told us about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I leave the issue of Medicare benefits, the member for Dobell might be interested to know that the previous government had already changed Medicare. In the 1994 budget, when you were in government, you announced that you would be setting up what were then called practice enhancement grants, now euphemistically known as the better practice payments program. This is a direct income subsidy for doctors. You can get an average of $10,000 per year from the government if you are a general practitioner. It is a wonder I did not stay in medical practice but, so provoked was I, I decided to come here.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2450">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Labor Party was in government, you effectively froze the Medicare rebate&mdash;that is, the refund patients get when they are sick and visit their doctor&mdash;and the bulk-bill payment. You effectively froze them and took money out of the Medicare rebates to give to doctors. A very worthy and needy cause, I am sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is now suddenly concerned about the Medicare rebates. You might remember that last year the previous government's own inflation forecast in their budget was somewhere between three and four per cent&mdash;in fact, 3.25 per cent. But did they increase Medicare rebates by that amount? No! They increased specialist rebates by 1.7 per cent and GP rebates by a little over 0.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, despite raising this matter of public importance, the best the member for Dobell could do was to read bits out of the newspapers. The MPI also mentions aged care, and I thought we were talking about aged care. I remind the House that under the previous government aged care was seriously underfunded. We still have an excessively regulated industry. Under the previous government, we had three independent inquiries which three years ago recommended, for example, an increase of $1.68 per day for the provision of laundry, food, maintenance and other services for older people in nursing homes. But it still does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, inherited from the previous government, we are paying about $100 a day for each resident in a nursing home. Do you know what we spend looking after criminals in Australia? The ACT government pays the New South Wales government just under $190 a day to look after its criminals. Yet the previous government put a value on aged people, whose sacrifices made the country what it is, of a miserable $100 a day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, Professor Bob Gregory's report, stage 2, still remains unaddressed. We are now trying to deal with that. So bad had things become over the last 13 years that he put a value on bringing Australia's nursing homes up to fire, health, outcome and design standards of $1 billion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have found in Australia's nursing homes that many of those who are trying to look after older people spend far more time carrying clipboards around trying to deal with multiple levels of bureaucracy and bureaucrats actually looking over them than they do providing care for the residents in the homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The COAG process to which the previous government was committed, and to which we are now basically committed, is trying to deal with those various layers of administration to try to get as much bureaucracy as we can out of it whether it is in the provision of health services generally or aged care and more attention put on care itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things which the opposition fails to appreciate in the COAG communique is, regardless of whether it is aged care or disability services or home and community care, we continue to be committed to a national and a universal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the opposition is concerned about Medicare rebates and aged care, then they need to support the creation of more wealth and get behind our industrial relations reforms. They need to support us in turning the current government deficit into surplus and to do everything we can to make it easier for businesses to create the wealth that needs to be spent on health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the member for Dobell would like a briefing on health or anything else, I would be more than pleased to give it to him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in opposition to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 and in strong support of the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan). In his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The End of Certainty </EMPHASIS> published in 1992, Paul Kelly described Alfred Deakin as the architect of what he called the `Australian settlement' and the five principles on which the Commonwealth of Australia began in 1901. In an age of consensus, they were principles which dominated Australian politics until the 1960s. The five principles were white Australia, industry protection, wage arbitration, state paternalism and imperial benevolence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2455">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All five elements had a common theme: protection all around. White Australia would protect Australian workers from internal competition from cheap exploited labour. Tariffs would protect domestic production from external competition. The state would protect victims of loss. The Royal Navy would protect our shores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Kelly explains the Deakinite settlement, the Commonwealth was founded on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . faith in government authority; a belief in egalitarianism; a method of judicial determination in centralised wage fixation; the protection of its industry and its jobs; dependence on a great power (first Britain, then America) for its security and finance; and, above all, hostility to its geographic location, exhibited in fear of external domination and internal contamination from the peoples of the Asia/Pacific. Its bedrock ideology was protection.</PARA>
<PARA>Two of the five principles that have now gone are white Australia and imperial benevolence. One of them&mdash;industry protection&mdash;is going, while the other two, state paternalism and wage protection, are very much under attack. The last is now threatened by the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pioneering work of Mr Justice Higgins set the model of centralised wage&hyphen;fixing and his concept of a basic wage with elements of what we now call the social wage. It was there from the outset in the famous Harvester judgment of 1907, reported as ex parte H.V. McKay (1907) 2 Commonwealth Arbitration Reports, page 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This judgment in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration took a quasi legislative role in attempting to balance the needs and capacity of the worker and his family with the capacity of industry to pay, defining what was fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Higgins adopted the words of Pope Leo XIII in his encyclical <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rerum Novarum</EMPHASIS> (1891) about the moral responsibility to provide standards of reasonable and frugal comfort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basis of the Deakinite model of wage arbitration was that employers, employees and the community at large benefited from wage stability, applicable right across the country. Families could be self&hyphen;supporting and not dependent on welfare and would maintain <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their purchasing power&mdash;very important for shopkeepers and other mainstays of the local economy. The community benefited by maintaining living standards above subsistence levels. The employer stood to gain in the long term from predicability, a cooperative attitude towards trade unions and a stable labour force which was disinclined to strike, as workers had in the 1890s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasise Mr Justice Higgins, Henry Bournes Higgins&mdash;not to be confused with Bernard Shaw's Henry Higgins in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pygmalion</EMPHASIS>&mdash;because 80 years after the Harvester judgment he became the subject of bitter attacks by the H.R. Nicholls Society. Indeed, the name of H.R. Nicholls, used by an organisation of economic rationalists, was exhumed because he had attacked Higgins vehemently. In an editorial entitled `A modest judge' in the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> of April 1911, Nicholls called Higgins a political judge and for this he was charged with contempt. H.R. Nicholls, ironically, was a former radical turned reactionary. As a young man, he had been with Peter Lalor at the Eureka Stockade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hugh Morgan of the Western Mining Corporation, or his excitable speech writer, said in 1985 that Higgins' centralised wage&hyphen;fixing was leading Australia down to `catastrophic collision with rural bankruptcy, sudden South American style devaluations, international insolvency and grave social dislocation'. Hugh Morgan was never one for understatement! We seemed to avoid that outcome for the following decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more significant was a speech that one J.W. Howard made to the H.R. Nicholls Society in September 1986:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Justice Higgins' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harvester</EMPHASIS>  judgment of 1907 effectively determined that Australian industrial relations would be inflexible and centralised. According to Higgins, it would be better for an employer to go out of business rather than pay his employees less than the fixed rate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is a supreme irony that a coalition which pays lip&hyphen;service to the family and family values should be so hostile to Higgins and the Harvester judgment, because Higgins emphasised a centrality of wage&hyphen;fixing to meet family needs. It was not a mere payment to the breadwinner himself or herself. How odd that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2456"> the Treasurer (Mr Costello), who made his reputation as a union buster in the Dollar Sweets case, should represent the federal division of Higgins!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be wrong to pretend that the Harvester model remained unchanged since 1907. Significant changes were introduced between 1983 and the present by the Hawke and Keating governments, especially the Industrial Relations Reform Act of 1993 which made sweeping changes, notably with enterprise flexibility agreements, EFAs. By September 1995, there were 9,367 enterprise agreements&mdash;5,130 in the federal jurisdiction, involving 58 per cent of eligible workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle of enterprise bargaining was introduced and widely adopted, especially in the upper skill ranges&mdash;that is, where workers had a skill that was scarce and of critical importance to employers. Mostly they did not negotiate as individuals but with the assistance of their trade unions. But sometimes they would negotiate individually. It meant that workers such as computer programmers, offshore oil drillers, air traffic controllers and some emergency workers were able to secure wage and salary rises far higher than were anticipated by the prices and incomes accord. Sometimes they failed, as with the commercial air pilots strike in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a further, more radical move away from the cooperative model of industrial relations which Australia has essentially enjoyed since the Harvester judgment towards the full enterprise bargaining model, a social Darwinian approach essentially based on the survival of the fittest. The central and cruelest fallacy of the workplace relations bill is the assumption that employers and employees negotiate on equal terms. Each wants something that the other has&mdash;labour in exchange for wages. But this is no level playing field. The bargaining power of an individual employer and an individual employee are inherently unequal, probably by an order of magnitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of federal awards, there will be AWAs, Australian workplace agreements. These may be negotiated on a group basis, but must be entered into as single enterprise <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agreements, one&hyphen;on&hyphen;one: one employer&mdash;but, in reality, one enterprise&mdash;and one employee, </PARA>
<PARA>who in this case is on his or her own. The lower down the skill range where unemployment levels are highest, especially in those regions where unemployment levels are well above the national average and where there may be 20 applicants for every job, the idea that applicants&mdash;supplicants really&mdash;are able to drive a shrewd bargain and negotiate effectively without assistance, one&hyphen;to&hyphen;one, is a cruel hoax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill becomes law, there will be a sharply reduced capacity to initiate discussion about wages and conditions, to set minimum standards. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission in its diminished role will cease to be the ultimate arbiter to ensure justice and equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I support the concerns of the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) expressed in the House yesterday about the likely adverse effect of this legislation on the status of women. I draw the attention of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock)&mdash;who has been described as the warm and caring face of the Liberal Party's New South Wales branch&mdash;to the possible situation where five Turkish or Vietnamese women, with very limited English, apply for a job as a cleaner. It would be absurd to see them as having equal capacity to bargain with an employer. Theoretically, one of the women might say, `I'd like to bring in the union to negotiate for me.' But it would be reasonable to assume that she would be out the door before she finished the sentence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cynics, perhaps the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), might argue that the parties are evenly matched: if the job applicant speaks little English then the employer will not speak any Turkish, so the balance is restored. But even stating that proposition underlines the nature of the power struggle in a situation where the applicant submits to minimum wages, opts out trade union protection and loses the active intervention of the trade union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The face of the trade union movement changed dramatically in the 1980s. Union <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2457"> membership declined from about 46 per cent of the total work force in 1986 to less than 38 per cent a decade later. In 1980-81, the average number of working days lost per thousand employees per year was 725&mdash;a figure which fell to the 235 in 1986-87 and to 78 in 1994-95. Prima facie, that suggests an industrial relations system which is working and is working well. `No,' says the incoming government, `we really have to produce a radically different change with existing workplace relations.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employment in manufacturing, the most highly unionised sector historically, fell from 19.7 per cent in 1980 to 13.6 per cent in 1995. Casual employment rose from 15.8 per cent in 1984 to 23.7 per cent in 1994. Part-time employment rose from 17.8 per cent to 24.3 per cent. Advocates of this bill say that is not enough change. In fact, our government brought in so many changes that we lost the votes of many of our traditional supporters who suffered from reform fatigue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Prime Minister (John Howard) said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> early in the election campaign that his vision for Australia was to make it relaxed and comfortable, it sounded ludicrously limited but, in fact, his judgment was absolutely correct. He captured the mood of anxiety and grievance in the community. He was right, as it happened; we were wrong. However, the likely results of this legislation, if it should become law in this form, will be neither relaxed nor comfortable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program on the conditions of female outworkers in the clothing industry should be made compulsory viewing in the Liberal and National party rooms before members vote on this bill, especially the sections on compulsory unionism and the right of entry of trade unions. If anything, it suggests that trade unions lack adequate capacity to intervene in the appalling sweated labour in many of our cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1">  There is a sharp distinction between apparent freedom and real freedom. Some will argue that the abolition of compulsory unionism is a great advance, so too the ending of secondary boycotts&mdash;the issue that made the Treasurer's reputation. There has never been any legislation imposing compulsory union ism. It has not been recognised by the High Court or the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. However, de facto compulsory unionism&mdash;the closed shop&mdash;exists in many federal industries as informal arrangements between unions, employees and employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not aware of any evidence that compulsory unionism has been oppressive&mdash;certainly not in the period when union membership, as a proportion of the total labour force, has been in long-term decline. Compulsory unionism is no more oppressive than compulsory registration or compulsory voting. The benefits of union membership are likely to be greatest with the unskilled, the lowest wage earners, those with poor language skills and low self-confidence. The benefit of compulsory unionism was merely to provide a disincentive to employers from coercing members out of membership. Relations between the trade unions and many of the major employers have been based on mutual respect, and they enter into negotiations very willingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Freedom of association, as set out in the minister's second reading speech on 23 May, sounds like a noble aspiration with its corollary of freedom not to associate. But can we guarantee that the employer would be absolutely neutral on the issue? The minister said in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Closed shops will be abolished. The government is not anti-union, and our legislation is not an attack on unions.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Far from withering away, entrepreneurial unions will succeed in this environment.</PARA>
<PARA>There is not one sentence in the speech that asserts that compulsory unionism has been oppressive or a hardship. The whole context of the bill suggests a major weakening of the trade union movement's capacity to provide a voice to the voiceless; strength to the weak.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The period 1983-86 was marked by greatly increased flexibility in the industrial relations system. It was essentially a dual system. Centralised wage fixing based on collective bargaining&mdash;sometimes directly between trade unions and employers, but generally through federal awards laid down by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;was the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2458"> norm. On the periphery&mdash;but of increasing importance in later years&mdash;was enterprise bargaining which was generally negotiated through the union, but sometimes individually. As I said earlier, the result was a period of unparalleled industrial harmony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor initiated flexibility with some difficulty and potential political and industrial risk. Australia maintained a productivity rate well above the OECD average, although lower in the 1980s than in the 1970s. This reflected an employment shift towards service employment inherently much lower in productivity, such as comparing a hairdresser with a steel worker or, as some unkind people might say, even a Deputy Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his speech the minister argues that the need for reform of industrial relations is confirmed by the latest ABS statistics which show an intolerable rate of unemployment, at 8.9 per cent, and a disgraceful 27.8 per cent for our youth. In a strong article, `Howard's Unemployment Hoax', Ross Gittins wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 12 June that it is a scandal that `politicians who campaign on youth unemployment always quote the percentage, never the actual number'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 1.3 million people aged from 15&hyphen; to 19 in Australia and the recorded number of unemployed is 90,000&mdash;that is, that is seven per cent of the cohort. When the Prime Minister was Treasurer back in 1983, youth unemployed were 150,000, a far higher proportion of the 15&hyphen; to 19 cohort, because the population has risen since then. The explanation for the difference between the seven per cent, which is the real figure, and the 27.8 per cent, which is so often quoted, is the revolutionary change in the educational take-up in the 1980s, which means that of the 1.3 million young people aged between 15 and 19, almost one million of them are still being educated. So the total youth labour force, that is, the 1.3 million from which we deduct the number of people in full-time education, is only 330,000 and the 90,000 jobless 27.8 per cent of that. Gittins wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Politicians are seeking to exploit the public's misconception rather than correct it. They're perpetrators of The Great Youth Unemployment Hoax.    <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>This is all advanced by the government as a justification for reducing youth wages in an attempt to reduce youth unemployment. It is the thin end of the wedge approach, an attack on the concept of equal pay for equal work, a concept that was fundamental in increasing wage levels for women workers. I strongly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Canberra and hope we can maintain one of the best elements of Australia's political and social system, our cooperative industrial relations, or, if the government would prefer, `workplace relations' system.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the facade of indignation and outrage, members of the Labor Party must be quietly relieved that the coalition has accepted the challenge of solving the problem of labour market reform&mdash;which they have either ignored or have kept in the too hard basket for the past 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, has been making a number of public <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2459"> comments in recent days, comments which give credence to our industrial relations policy. I trust that in future he will talk frankly about the type of industrial relations system he envisaged for this country. In particular, I hope we will hear him echo his 1993 speech, in which he told us that what this country needed was `a model which places emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals', `a model under which compulsorily arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is too much to hope that the current ALP leader, Mr Beazley, will echo those thoughts. After all, if the former Prime Minister had to back down from his statement that wages and conditions of work will be determined by agreements worked out by the employer, the employees and the union, I feel Mr Beazley will have an even harder job. If he had to back down from this statement because of pressure from the de facto ACTU government, then the current leader has no hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A look at the current ALP frontbench shows that the very people who were instrumental in this backdown sit at his right&hyphen;hand side. Now, three years after that debacle, the coalition government is pushing ahead with many of the previously endorsed reforms which they were unable to bring about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australia truly is now at the crossroads, so is the Australian Labor Party. Its approach to industrial relations could well be its undoing. The opposition knows that Australia must change. It knows of the pain caused by its unworkable and grossly unfair industrial relations system. It must also be fully aware of the plight of the 8.6 per cent of Australia's population who are unemployed. If they are not aware of it, then those in my electorate of Deakin certainly conveyed a very loud and clear message at the 2 March election. Their pain has been inflicted by 13 years of hard Labor and the refusal of the opposition to support this bill will only ensure that their pain continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's stance on industrial relations is symptomatic of the political limbo <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which now confronts it. Allow me to counter just a few of the misleading accusations that the ACTU is asking its political party to make&mdash;firstly, that people will be worse off under our proposed legislation. This is an objection which simply has no grounding in fact. Employers and employees under the federal award system may opt to stay put under the protection of federal awards. A worker can opt to rely on the security of the safety net. However, it would indeed be a shame because he or she could do better. But the commission will be there to set the minima. Therefore, workers can choose to bargain, they can choose not to bargain or they can choose not to choose at all&mdash;that is, to stay with the status quo. This bill, after all, is about offering such a choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Should the workers of a business opt to negotiate a certified agreement with their employer, the deal will only be certified by the commission if it meets the same set of minima which apply to Australian workplace agreements&mdash;a concept similar to the no disadvantage test which the opposition throws up repeatedly. Therefore, workers are offered the opportunity to roll the dice, but they are also told in the rolling of that dice that they cannot lose their minima. It is a risk free decision. It is not a gamble. Should the worker decide to opt for an Australian workplace agreement, an individual contract with the employer, again, he or she will be able to enter the negotiations confident that there is nothing to lose and much to gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The worker may choose to avail himself or herself of union representation but is also free to refuse the intervention of the union. Once again, the key to the process is freedom to choose. I ask: what is wrong with the notion of workers being free to choose? But we know that freedom to refuse the intervention of a union does not go down well with George's and Kelty's super unions, never mind that the changes are desperately needed to guide this country into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this obstinate insistence on personal power play by the union bosses, that their insistence on power is placed before the interests of the people, that I find so un&hyphen;Australian and so unattractive. If we compare <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2460"> the 35 per cent of union employees in Australia today with the 47 per cent in 1991 and the electoral support of the blue collar workers for the coalition at the last election, it is quite clear that the people of this country have recognised what the ALP and the ACTU have failed to recognise&mdash;their representation is outdated, outlived and irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the coalition's industrial relations policy, freedom of association will be the name of the game. The roles of unions will be revamped and the creation of enterprise unions and autonomous enterprise branches will be facilitated. This will offer employees the option of joining or not joining a union, or joining that union which he or she feels will better defend his or her particular interests. Compulsory unionism will end and workers will be given a choice. Once again, I say: what is wrong with giving employees the choice? It is all about freedom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Underlying the concept of mandatory union involvement in the workplace is the belief that Australian workers have to be protected from themselves. We are told that if workers are given the opportunity to negotiate their conditions directly with management, they will give it all away, they will allow themselves to be underpaid and overworked. This is a paternalistic attitude, an attitude which has been prevalent in our system since federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) mentioned in his speech, this outdated, paternalistic attitude that has been prevalent in various aspects of our society has no place in the modern Australian workplace. It is demeaning, it is an insult to workers and is contrary to all notions of employee empowerment. Yet we have Labor members of this House and union officials hypocritically advocating notions of employee empowerment. For example, when the member for Chifley (Mr Price) spoke on 30 May, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part of the accord process, part of what was happening in industrial relations over that 13 years, was based on the idea&mdash;and it was supported by the trade union movement&mdash;that workers have to be involved in decision making and that productivity could not really be improved by working with a top&hyphen;down approach. A bottom&hyphen;up approach will yield the best results. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>These notions of employee empowerment have been espoused for years and have become prevalent in Australian industrial workplace situations. I have been one of the advocates of employee empowerment in the past. But employee empowerment must go all the way to include industrial relations reforms and the notion that employees can choose, if that is their wish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel that unions should have more faith in the intelligence of Australian workers, rather than treating them as children needing to be protected from their own natural desires to better their standard of living. A classic example, of course, is the unions' protests at the desires of employees in such places as the Tweed Valley Fruit Processors Pty Ltd and CRA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous system unions were given a virtual monopoly over coverage of employees under the so&hyphen;called `conveniently apply' rule. This led the union hierarchy to become rigid and generally unresponsive to the real needs of workers. The super unions thrived and smaller unions were pressured to join. As a result of this bill, these union monopolies will become a thing of the past, as will the disproportionate political influence of the super unions. They will become more democratic. They will be better able to deal with the particular needs of their members and, overall, more efficient. We should not be surprised if this bill actually marks the beginning of a new golden era for an intelligent and caring union movement. Now, at the 11th hour, we find the opposition supporting the notion of disamalgamation of unions, an issue which the bill tackles head on. The super unions have indeed become too big to serve their constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the foundation of the opposition to our reforms lies the tragic tale of the disenfranchised, those Australians for whom the super unions refuse to fight&mdash;the unemployed, the 850,000 odd Australians who are without work, the 28 per cent of young Australians between the age of 15 and 19 who are unemployed. That is 93,800 young people who are starting their working lives totally in despair. These people have never been granted the benefit of the protection of either the unions or the ALP. But they are people to whom the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2461"> coalition has a definite commitment, not only for tomorrow but for their future as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will impact positively on youth unemployment because the government has recognised that they are the future of Australia. Through this industrial relations bill we will allow the continuation of the junior rate which was going to be abolished under the Labor government. The abolition of the junior rate would result in over 250,000 young people losing their jobs, as estimated by retailers' sources alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition, advocating the abolition of junior rates, did not have at heart the future of young people who would lose their jobs in consequence. All they care about is making some arcane, politically correct point. Junior rates do discriminate. They discriminate in favour of young people having a job. The government's legislation, if passed by the other house, will ensure that they continue to keep their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the impact on small business&mdash;a very prominent part of my electorate&mdash;it is evident that employers would not be penalised for creating new jobs or be threatened by malicious and frivolous claims made under the unfair dismissal laws. Workers in small business are endorsing and supporting the government's proposed changes to the industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another misconception about this bill which I have heard on more than one occasion is that the power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will in some way be emasculated by the new legislation. The proponents of this view are often of the opinion that changes to the commission&mdash;no matter what changes&mdash;are the beginning of the end of the commission's role in the Australian industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there is nothing new in the redefinition of the role of the commission. If we examine its evolution since 1905, it is quite clear that what is now known as the AIRC has undergone change&mdash;change much greater than the modest reforms the coalition is now proposing: from the initial one&hyphen;person Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration that existed until 1914 to a major structural change in the court's operation in 1920, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from the 1926 amendments which enabled the government to appoint conciliation commissioners to the 1928 amendments to encourage conciliation, a change in 1947 and 1956 when two separate bodies were created, and the several major changes that occurred in the 1970s, particularly in the years 1972, 1975 and 1979. The point is that recent suggested changes are evolutionary&mdash;changes to the commission to suit the times. The AIRC will be there and will have a role to play. Rather than considering this as a revolutionary change, we see it as evolving into a new workplace environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIRC will ensure that the award safety net of minimum wages and conditions is upheld. It will oversee the process of awards simplification and will encourage the making of agreements between employers and employees. It will have greater powers to stop or prevent industrial action and will be able to intervene to resolve disputes where all attempts to reach an agreement have failed. There is no doubt in my mind that, while these adjustments to the role of the commission are long overdue, to construe them as an attempt to silence or abolish such an important institution in the Australian industrial relations system is simply wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, there are those in Australia who are determined to portray this type of progress as uncaring and unnecessary, no matter how much evidence to the contrary. We are told time after time that any change to industrial relations brought about by the coalition would always be skewed in favour of the employer. Try telling the 850,000 unemployed that the ALP is their friend and saviour and that the ALP amendments will help them get a job when, after 13 years in government, they still failed to achieve any meaningful increase in employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly hope that the Australian people see through these unjust accusations directed at the coalition and understand that our changes are symbolic of the coalition's commitments to overcome the deficiencies of the current system, deficiencies which have seen a decline in living standards and real wages, high levels of unemployment, an unacceptable level of industrial conflict and, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2462"> above all, this notion strikes at the paternalistic attitude towards employees, an attitude which leads to their marginalisation in the workplace, and supporting an outdated institutional arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Deakin in Melbourne's east businesses have greeted the content of this bill with enthusiasm. I have met with business representatives, the unemployed and the chambers of commerce and there is much enthusiasm for the principles of this bill and its objectives of creating both work and a real change in living standards. One criticism by many in my electorate is that these reforms perhaps do not go far enough&mdash;but that is another debate&mdash;and that employees are still overprotected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislation that will help employees to get a better deal and to be rewarded for their enthusiasm is legislation which needs the support of both parties. I have met with people who have told me that the reforms are taking too long and that they do not have the luxury of time to wait for real change. We know where the blame lies: it lies with those who are against progress in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, let me express my surprise and disappointment that the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) has so thoroughly debased the Deakin legacy. How ironic that, on this industrial relations legislation, a member representing the seat of Deakin would declare himself to be much more a disciple of von Hayek than the original small `l' liberal thinker in Australia. It was Deakin who helped establish the great tradition in this nation that there should be cooperation and interdependence between workers. But what the member has demonstrated is his belief&mdash;indeed, it is the conviction of the Liberal Party&mdash;that governments should see every worker as an individual instead of seeing every workplace as a cooperative enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought on this matter Liberal Party members could do no better than to refer themselves to the first speech in this chamber by one of their colleagues, the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes). On 20 May she declared her hand. She declared her support for a philosophy of liberalism:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . not the atomistic liberalism expressed by those whose rhetoric emphasises terms like `individual rights', but the strand that emerged through the work of John Stuart Mill and later built on by Hobhouse. Together with their peers they recognised the interdependence of humans and the proper role of government in supporting conditions of positive interdependence.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is an outstanding definition of what small `l' liberalism should be about in the 1990s&mdash;supporting the interdependence of workers, supporting the interdependence of citizens, not a philosophy which sees workers as atoms floating throughout the labour market; atoms which have to compete with each other, dog&hyphen;eat&hyphen;dog style&mdash;and a recognition that workers should be placed in an environment of collective arrangements, cooperation and interdependence. It is a sad day for the politics of this nation and the Australian parliament when the Liberal Party has so thoroughly declared its hand for von Hayek, an atomistic definition of liberalism, as the member for Kingston defined it, which sees workers as atoms moving about the labour market, instead of a positive definition of liberalism which would recognise the interdependence of workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads one to conclude that government should be facilitating enterprise bargaining, not individual competition and individual employment contracts. Government should be about fostering cooperation in the workplace, not encouraging a break&hyphen;out of individual employment contracts whereby each worker would have their own contract. They would be looking over each other's shoulders out of envy, out of suspicion and out of concern that someone else has a better employment contract than they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dog&hyphen;eat&hyphen;dog is a recipe for reduced productivity in the Australian workplace. Atomistic workplace relations are a recipe for reduced productivity. I say: shame on the Liberal Party for promoting that philosophy in this place. Shame on the Liberal Party for trying to bring that narrow political philosophy to the workplaces and the enterprises of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing exposes the shortcomings of the Liberal Party in the 1990s more comprehensively than this legislation. Nothing better demonstrates the ideological dogma with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2463"> which they wasted their years in opposition. At a time when political causes and governments throughout the Western world are seeking new instruments of social security, economic security and equity, this bill seeks to entrench a new source of economic insecurity and inequality in Australia. At a time when the United States Congress is debating increases to the minimum wage and greater labour market rigidity, this parliament is considering a large slab of labour market deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when Britain is debating the virtues of higher minimum wage rates, this bill seeks to anchor award minima in Australia&mdash;an anchor by which low skill, low productivity workers will lose any prospect of a wage increase. At a time when economists worldwide are awaken to the unique and segmented nature of the post&hyphen;Fordist labour market, this legislation applies a single, homogenous set of rules to all labour market segments and locations in Australia. At a time when workplace policies and thinking require a new level of sophistication, the Liberal Party has sat still and watched the world march by&mdash;leaving it with the outdated dogma of labour market deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill framed through the eyes of two suburban solicitors&mdash;the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the member for Flinders (Mr Reith). It is no less a blunder than the last time an out&hyphen;of&hyphen;touch tory from the electorate of Flinders introduced industrial relations reform into this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill demonstrates the substantial differences between Labor and the coalition on competition policy. Whereas the government's first priority is to create more competition between workers in all segments of the labour market, Labor believes that this type of competition in the non-traded sector is simply a recipe for driving down real wages. It will lead to a new generation of working poor in Australia and, in its macro impact, lower spending power and lower employment, particularly in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a defining feature of the coalition parties that they never differentiate between segments of the labour market and their capacity to cope with more competition. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Whereas the National Party will talk day and night about the differing features of product markets&mdash;they will tell us that wheat is different to sugar, is different to beef, is different to a whole range of other agricultural product markets&mdash;they never ever assume that the labour market is anything but homogenous. They never assume that the labour market in Australia is diverse&mdash;diverse skills, diverse locations and diverse enterprise arrangements. They never assume those things for a moment. Only Labor acknowledges that the impact of wage competition on shop assistants, for instance, is very different to its impact on biotechnologists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, at all levels of government, is keener to apply labour market competition to semiskilled workers who are price takers than to highly skilled professionals, like the doctors and lawyers, who are price makers. Coalition MPs talk about the labour market as if they are talking about a market for fish and chips. When you listen to the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and their colleagues they talk about the labour market as if they are talking about the market for fish and chips.</PARA>

It is about aspirations and economic security. For the coalition it is just another commodity to be traded according to the laws of supply and demand and the pricing mechanism. For those Liberal Party members from urban electorates, it is just another accounting exercise&mdash;a pure exercise in accountancy&mdash;where at the end of the day they add up their labour costs and all they want to do is reduce them, irrespective of the impact on workers, their families, their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2464"> living standards and their economic aspirations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Berowra confirms, it is nothing more than an accounting exercise for the coalition. Labor's policy sets out a different moral code and a very different sense of fairness. We believe in shielding semiskilled, low productivity workers from the worst features of globalisation while vigorously applying competition policies to the traded sector. We believe very strongly in building a sustainable floor under the labour market so that all Australian workers receive a decent living wage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been introduced under the banner of competition. This is a government which applies competition only to semiskilled workers and not to the big end of town. This is a government which believes that those who can best cope with more market competition should be shielded from it while those who can least effectively cope&mdash;the low skill, low productivity workers&mdash;now face the spectre of individual employment contracts. It will be open slather and open competition in the labour market for those who can least provide for themselves in globalised economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The double standards and the hypocrisy of the coalition on these matters are absolutely stark and stunning. It is labour market competition for low skill, low productivity workers. But, according to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) in this week's press, it is higher tariffs for the manufacturing sector&mdash;higher tariffs to protect profits in Australia; protect profits not jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Business Council of Australia, which love more labour market competition, they want a weakening of the merger test. They know they have a sympathetic ear in the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), who in 1991 opposed the tougher test on mergers introduced by the former Labor government. While it is open slather and open market competition in the labour market, this government have dropped the cross&hyphen;ownership provisions for airports. They have also abandoned the full cost pricing on airports, a major benefit for Qantas, Ansett, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> AMP, BAA and Lend Lease. All those benefits shielded markets for their big business mates. But for the semiskilled, low productivity workers of Australia it will be open slather and open labour market competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You hear the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Ron Boswell&mdash;he is not a minister but just their leader&mdash;saying that he does not want any competition on sugar or any competition on wheat marketing. Of course, he had a sympathetic ear in the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), who has decided to retain the single desk marketing on wheat, irrespective of the national competition policy reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For doctors, this is a government which is ignoring the findings of the Baume report on collusive practices by the college of surgeons. For lawyers, we have Jeff Kennett's sweetheart deal with the Victorian Bar Association. For highly skilled, professional people in Australia, such as doctors and lawyers, the coalition believes in protected, closed markets; but for semiskilled, low productivity workers throughout the country the coalition believes in open, competitive markets. What a stunning double standard. What a shameful piece of political hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To cap it all off, question time today was the coup de grace: the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy was asked whether or not he supported the national electricity grid, and he could not provide an answer. He is part of a government in which the frontbenchers and backbenchers of the Liberal Party and the National Party have all hands on deck to sing the praises of open slather, open labour market competition. But when it comes to an open, competitive market on electricity what is their view? They have no view. There is no view from the senior minister responsible for energy. He said that it was a matter for someone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Queensland, of course, it is nothing more than a product of parochialism, cronyism and absolute stupidity. The member for Moreton should be ashamed of the Queensland government saying that New South Wales and Victorian electricity is somehow different from Queensland electricity. I have heard a report that Borbidge asked his bureaucrats, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2465"> `Why can't we be like Tasmania, where they run the electricity line through the sea?' They had to say, `Mr Premier, we're not an island. We're connected by land to New South Wales.' I do not know whether he was stunned by that, but this is the level of parochialism and protection they will apply to product markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the non-traded sector, in relation to unskilled workers, the supply of labour is much greater than the demand for labour. What happens when the supply of labour is much greater than the demand for labour? The price of labour goes down. The government want that in their accounting exercise. But they do not appreciate that the price of labour in their narrow economic view of the world is someone's income. It is someone's pay packet; they come home on a Thursday night and put that pay packet on the family table. It is the pay packet that feeds the children, that clothes the children, that educates the family and that tries to look after the family interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government's narrow accounting exercise is no more than an attempt to drive down the price of labour, the Australian Labor Party appreciates that wages are the lifeblood of Australian families and households. This government has two standards. For workers it is all pain and no gain; it is all competition, all pain, all readjustment and no gain. For big business and all those highly skilled professionals, such as the doctors and the lawyers, it is all protection, no competition and all gain. That is the stunning double standard and act of hypocrisy of this coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party in the 1990s do not mind rent seekers and they do not mind special pleaders, as long as those people are from the big end of town. The Liberal Party like a bit of rent seeking, they like a bit of special pleading on the product markets, as long as you are from the big end of town.

Workers can be effective only if they cooperate, if they collaborate, if they are willing to engage in collective arrangements, enterprise bargaining, enterprise arrangements in the workplace. That is the only way in which they can improve their productivity and the economic performance of this nation. So what is the government trying to do?

I refer members opposite to no less a source than the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Record</EMPHASIS> of March 1996, which contained an outstanding article by two academics from the University of Melbourne. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes in wage&hyphen;setting institutions or in the role of unions in wage&hyphen;setting may also affect earnings inequality. As one effect of trade unions is to reduce earnings dispersion within the group of employees who are union members, a decrease in union density could affect earnings dispersion. Borland finds that a decline in union density can explain approximately 30 per cent of the increase <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in variance of earnings of full&hyphen;time male employees in Australia between 1986 and 1994, and 15 per cent of the increase in the variance of earnings of full&hyphen;time female employees over the same period.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the research of these Melbourne academics telling the House of Representatives? They are saying that collective representation in the workplace is fundamental to a more equal society. They have found that the decline in union density can explain up to 30 per cent of the increase in wage inequality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that wants to run unions into the ground; this is a government that wants to run unions out of the workplaces of Australia. They do that for one purpose, a purpose verified by the statistical data from the University of Melbourne, and that is to increase wage inequality. For semi&hyphen;skilled, low productivity workers, the only route to a wage increase is collective bargaining strength in the workplace and the sorts of reforms that the former government introduced through the accord process. That is their only route to a pay increase. If you leave them to the cold winds and wolves of market competition where, in their segment of the labour market, the supply is greater than the demand, the price of labour drops. And as it drops, wages go down and families have a reduced standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to all the academic evidence and all the research and international debate, this government has the worst sort of industrial relations reform before the House. It is an absolute disgrace. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to express the concerns of thousands of students in my electorate and others around the country about the future of higher education in Australia, concerns that resulted in the National Tertiary Education Union and the National Union of Students organising a national week of action against the government last month. Why is such drastic action being taken by staff and students? Simply because this coalition government is shamelessly breaking election commitments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the election the coalition promised to `at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants'. What has happened to that promise? Like an increasingly large number of coalition pre&hyphen;election commitments, it seems to have gone right out the window. We now know that the funding cuts to universities in the budget could be as high as 12 per cent. Such cuts would have a devastating effect on access to higher education and result in significant job loss. The National Tertiary Education Union has estimated that, to fund a 12 per cent cut, would mean either 48,000 students missing out on a university place, or 19,000 jobs going, or HECS increasing by 120 per cent to $5,700.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is clear that regional universities right across Australia will be hit hardest by these funding cuts, I wish to draw to the House's attention the impacts on the two main universities in the ACT: the Australian National University and the University of Canberra. A 12 per cent cut would mean a loss of $32 million in funding to the ANU. This is equivalent to the funding of three of the six faculties at the university. So in order to meet the coalition's savings, half the faculties would have to be abolished. Alternatively, the ANU could savagely cut back its intake of first&hyphen;year students and abolish only one of the six faculties. Or it could maintain existing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> student numbers but reduce the quality of teaching by abolishing tutorials and reducing the number of units offered in each faculty. There is no doubt that these cuts will primarily impact on the learning opportunities of undergraduate students, because it is extremely unlikely that the ANU would look in the first instance to find savings in its world renowned research schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of Canberra, with an undergraduate population of around 6,000 and a limited income base, also looks set to be severely hit. Students at the University of Canberra will be faced with a reduction in the number of units offered within each faculty. If these cuts go ahead, it is inevitable that the range of degrees available will also be drastically reduced. These cuts will also have broader effects in the community through reductions in export earnings and employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's universities contribute positively to our balance of trade. The fees and personal expenditure of the 50,000 international students who study at Australian universities generate over $1.3 billion a year in higher education exports. In terms of export income, this is comparable to sales of wheat at $1.5 billion or iron and steel at $1.4 billion. According to Professor John Niland, the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of New South Wales:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 10 per cent cut in funding translated through to student places would reduce exports by over $130 million.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An initial fall in exports of $130 million will translate into a reduction of national income of about $260 million. That corresponds to some 11,000 jobs and a loss of government tax revenue of around $55 million.</PARA>
<PARA>Cuts of this nature will undoubtedly have an effect on employment in the regions, particularly in south&hyphen;eastern New South Wales, of which Canberra is the major regional centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ANU is the third biggest employer in Canberra behind the Commonwealth government and the ACT government. If it is forced to introduce a recruitment freeze and sack existing employees, the employment situation in the ACT will take another serious turn for the worse. The University of Canberra has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2469"> already instituted a recruitment freeze and looks certain to begin reducing staff levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite every member in this place to stop and think carefully about what the effects would be if the three largest employers in their electorate were to stop recruiting and begin shedding staff. I also ask them to think of the thousands of students who do not have the capacity to pay their way into university and who will miss out on their education if these cuts go ahead.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to raise some concerns about the content of the Parliament House art collection and some wider matters of democratic principle. Members will be familiar with the fable of the emperor's new clothes; a story about a very proud and conceited emperor who was persuaded by a passing charlatan to wear a suit made of a fabric of such lightness, of such elegance of design, of such innovation that it was fit only for the emperor. The emperor's blinding vanity was such that he ordered that he be paraded through the city wearing the suit, much to the pleasure and mirth of his sycophantic subjects, who continued to pour forth praise for the emperor until a young boy on the side of the road looked up with some shock and exclaimed, `The emperor is naked.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret that the fable provides a fitting background to the work of Senator Michael Beahan in his capacity as Chairman of the Parliamentary Art Advisory Committee. The President has largely directed the acquisitions policy of the parliament in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This week the President launched an exhibition of recent acquisitions entitled `Imagining the Real'. There are works of some obvious ability and interest in the exhibition, but I note the President's comments in opening the exhibition that many of those viewing the works were concerned the works had been hung upside down. The President suggested this was actually a virtue because it required observers `to get closer to the works'. I suggest that the President's comments and general approach in this area would eminently <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> qualify him for a place among the emperor's court of advisers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My immediate interest arises out of my experience this week in viewing the contents of the collection preparatory to receiving my allocation of three works. Ms Robyn Barker provided a photo&hyphen;slide tour of the collection. I have to say that Ms Barker is the picture of courtesy and efficiency. In order to save time, she asked me what particular genre I was interested in. I explained that I preferred something uplifting, ideally something that evidenced skills in drafting, good use of colour and light&mdash;something perhaps that was evocative of the beauty of the Australian landscape or of my electorate of Parramatta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could see by the look on Ms Barker's face that my prospects were not good. She kindly and gently explained to this philistine from Parramatta that the parliament's collection was primarily a `modernist' collection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This word `modern' is an interesting one. It was the subject of specific consideration by Mr Giles Auty, art critic for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Spectator</EMPHASIS>, in his lecture to the New South Wales Gallery of Art in 1994 entitled, `The Meaning of Modern'. Mr Auty spoke of modern art as being about attitude rather than quality. He spoke of the `great divorce' which now exists between the intelligent public and the art they find displayed in most of our public institutions. He suggested that `we have created a machine which is totally out of control and which is responsible to nobody'. Mr Auty was not criticising modern art per se but arguing against the systematic discrimination against anything vaguely traditional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The theme was taken up by Mr Terence Maloon, curator, art critic and educator, in an article for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Look</EMPHASIS> magazine:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To put the problem into a manageable perspective, we must surely agree that the vast majority of contemporary art is simply beneath consideration. It is bad, it is kitsch, it is irrelevant. . . To make matters even more exasperating, the weirder fringes of contemporary art appear to have the sanction of officialdom which have taken up the role of promoting and legitimising particular tendencies, championing a few artists while seeming to ignore alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Barker explained that all the works with anything approaching the character I described had been snapped up by the ministers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2470"> and members of greater seniority than me, a humble backbencher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I feel some sympathy for my colleague the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit). I suspect that by the time his turn comes he will be offered a piece of ornamental driftwood and some household refuse. My concerns, I know, are shared by other members. I would like to conclude by reading some extracts from a letter to the President from Dr Bob Woods, who says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have just sat through a viewing of some 400 so&hyphen;called works of art that was organised by the Parliament House art collection. I would have thought that a balanced collection was crucial for the national Parliament. Instead, we have a collection almost entirely weighted towards the avant&hyphen;garde. I think it accurate to say that there was not a single landscape painting and not one I would have been prepared to hang on my walls.</PARA>
<PARA>The young artist of Parramatta whose magnificent exhibition I recently opened would have no chance whatever of getting a painting hung in this gallery because it would not conform to the strict, elitist and completely arbitrary criteria of those selecting the artworks of this parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said in my maiden speech that one of the strengths of my electorate was its education system, with some 11 high schools in the region plus a TAFE college and campus of the University of Western Sydney at Nirimba.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These education facilities are particularly important due to the high youth population of the electorate. The University of Western Sydney was established in response to strong community demand for equity and access to higher education. It should also be remembered that without the support of Gough Whitlam this would never have come to pass. With the lack of support from the member for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bennelong, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), perhaps it may close.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the young people from our region are the first from their families to gain a degree. I am extremely disturbed to have been advised that one vice&hyphen;chancellor&mdash;not from the University of Western Sydney&mdash;has suggested that scholarships be made available to the top 25 per cent of students now on Austudy. This compares with 75 per cent that made use of such avenues in the 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 8 June this year, Adele Horin very succinctly put the case, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Poorer students would have to be very bright to go to university while the mediocre middleclass could buy their way in.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fees are so blatantly inequitable it is hard to believe their spectre has risen from the grave to haunt us again.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite some progress in education opportunities in western Sydney over the past 10 years, which I will refer to shortly, the region is still inadequately served with higher education opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Sydney has 40 per cent of Sydney's population and, while the rest of Sydney has 32 university places for every 1,000, the west at this stage can offer only eight places per 1,000. In 1989, the University of Western Sydney had 11,964 students and in 1995 this enrolment had increased to 22,803. Most importantly, the University of Western Sydney has been a major catalyst in lifting morale and the status of young people attending school in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 25,000 students have graduated from the University of Western Sydney over the past six years and some 50 per cent of these students have found work in the region. The proposed five to 12 per cent cut in funding for universities being suggested by the minister, either directly or by well&hyphen;directed leaks, has revived the push for the reintroduction of fees for undergraduate courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales Minister for Education is extremely concerned about the alleged 12 per cent cuts proposal, and as a western Sydney MP so he should be. He said recently:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2471">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a 12 per cent funding cut was applied to student places, the minimum T.E.R to enter university would probably rise from 50 to 58, making it harder for students to be able to enter university. Cuts of that magnitude, equivalent for up to $158 million or 22,700 students, would have a devastating impact on higher education, and would be particularly crippling to the University of Western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I referred earlier to an article by Adele Horin and I again quote part of her excellent essay. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Graduates pay when their incomes approach average weekly earnings. The prospect of paying back HECS has not deterred youngsters from starting university in the way that fees would. Why anyone would resurrect fees when we have this perfectly good version of user&hyphen;pays is hard to imagine.</PARA>
<PARA>One of our prominent local newspapers, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guardian</EMPHASIS> , recently reported Professor Deryck Schreuder, Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be tragic if funding cuts force us to turn away school leavers because we no longer have either the resources or the capacity to give them the quality education they deserve. Our slogan, `No education! No jobs! What future the West!' says it all. We are the powerhouse of the West.</PARA>
<PARA>Cuts to university funding and the introduction of university fees would clearly jeopardise the progress that has been made in expanding the opportunities for university education for young people in western Sydney. The people of the west will not easily forgive or forget the coalition for its appalling treatment of them&mdash;and why should they? The coalition will deserve every loss of seat it gets at every by&hyphen;election and in the next federal election. They simply cannot be trusted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this place this evening to place on record my deep commitment to and concern for the residents of Peat Island Centre, a facility for intellectually disabled people, which is situated on the banks of the Hawkesbury River in my electorate of Robertson. Ever since the Richmond report was brought down in March 1983, the debate has raged as to the best form of accommodation for these <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people. It was the Richmond report that began my involvement in politics. That is one reason why I have a special interest in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this report, Peat Island was described as an extremely isolated facility largely consisting of old barrack style buildings reflecting its original purpose as an isolation facility. The Richmond report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fortunately due to progressive management the hospital is well advanced in the process of placing clients in a planned way in the community.</PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, the opportunity exists to close Peat Island down by 1984.</PARA>
<PARA>Twelve years later there are still 133 residents living at Peat Island and the debate is still raging as to the residents' future. It has only been the concerted efforts of the staff and the residents' relatives that have seen Peat Island saved from closure. Yes, Mr Speaker, the buildings may be old and yes, the accommodation may not be as good as we would wish; but Peat Island and its residents are unique.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peat Island has been used as a mental institution&mdash;as they were then known&mdash;since 1901 and most of the residents have been living in this centre for a long time, in many cases for 20 years or more. It is their home; they are happy there. They have their friends and, most importantly, they are accepted by the community that surrounds Peat Island. I know this because I am part of this community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The residents of Peat Island are my friends and I am proud to say that I know the majority of these residents by name. They need consistency in their lives and they do not very easily accept or understand change. Obviously, it would be desirable to assimilate as many of these residents within society as possible. This can be done in a successful and caring way but, unfortunately, so many horror stories are told of people with psychiatric disabilities being sent out into an uncaring society and ending up in squalid boarding house accommodation at the mercy of unscrupulous landlords. It was with much interest and sadness that I listened to the member for Calare (Mr Andren) last evening in this place relate a letter from a constituent whose sister had suffered the very same problems after <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2472"> being set free from an institution, following the Richmond report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations of the Richmond report to deinstitutionalise those who suffer from severe psychiatric problems could only work with a massive injection of funds to ensure suitably staffed community cottages are readily available. Sadly, this has not been the case. On 15 June 1996, I was criticised by the Hon. Ron Dyer, the New South Wales Minister for Community Services, on ABC radio. He was responding to my claim that there was a serious shortage of nursing staff at Peat Island. I have in my possession a copy of a Peat Island staff newsletter in which, under the heading `Staff Shortages', the first line reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is currently a critical shortage of nursing staff at Peat Island.</PARA>
<PARA>This newsletter then goes on to detail the drastic measures which have been implemented in a desperate attempt to provide basic nursing coverage. If, in fact, there have been only a few resignations, transfers and applications for leave over the past 12 months, as the Hon. Ron Dyer implied, why is there such a critical shortage of nursing staff at the Peat Island Centre at present? Rather than waging a campaign to close Peat Island, the minister should be ensuring that the residents of Peat Island are receiving adequate care. He is wasting time and effort criticising those who genuinely care for these people.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

I have sat through well over 1,000 question times. I have never been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chastised for interjecting, nor have I been brought to order. I do not think I have ever been warned, either. In the last year and a half I have watched&mdash;as have others&mdash;the question of parliamentary behaviour becoming a major political issue. The question of the speakership then became an election issue. The desirability of there being an independent speaker was placed on the election agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Like many others in this chamber, I was encouraged by the fact that we would see some changes to the system we had inherited. I was therefore quite concerned when, early in the process, the issue of anticipation arose. Mr Speaker, I asked you some constructive and quite conscious questions about it. As time has gone on, I have watched with increasing concern the standard of behaviour of members and listened to responses to questions, points of order and your rulings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a spectacle earlier in the week involving the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). His behaviour may have been well suited to a British public school, but it certainly was not suitable here. If the behaviour and sense of humour he displays in here is being used in international fora on behalf of Australia, I am deeply disturbed by that fact. On three occasions at the dispatch box, his behaviour was not just personal, foolish and childish but way over the top and out of control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the previous government, I well recall the honourable member for Mayo being someone who constantly raised points of order and questioned the relevance and precision of ministers' answers. I find it quite galling to watch him act in the way that he recently has. We were promised by those in government that they would change the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) was also quite prominent in questioning ministers and Mr Speaker in the previous government about the process of question time. I am going to ask you, Mr Speaker, to have your staff read copies of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> from the last session of parliament and this session of parliament, when it is finished. They should look at how many points of order have been taken per question, not just per question time, because it is an hour and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2473"> a half long; question time has almost doubled in length. They should also look how many people have made them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened in this session has been absolutely minor, yet I was accused earlier in the week of making a frivolous point of order. I took exception to that, because I am not frivolous. If I take a point of order, let me assure you that there is something to it. I do not do it lightly. I am very aware of the forms. I am also very aware that, if I do not take a point of order, it does not help you, Mr Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not take points of order and draw your attention to misbehaviour and ministers straying from their responsibilities, no-one will. It is quite obvious that they have no intention of doing so. Read the day&hyphen;by&hyphen;day responses of ministers. One minister twice in two days chose not to answer questions, and virtually said so. When answering a question today, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said `my next point is', not `my response to the question is'. There was no attempt whatsoever by him to answer the question. We have seen within a matter of weeks a shift from these new high standards to an absolute dereliction of them. Unless we take points of order and raise questions, you, Mr Speaker, cannot do your job. The onus upon you becomes too great. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the attention of the House to a report in the Geelong <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser </EMPHASIS> of 18 June headed `Robinson chief's car torched'. It is alleged that those involved in union activity torched the car of a principal of a wool scouring firm in Geelong. The background to this dispute is clearly one of union demarcation. At a time when the coalition has just introduced its new industrial relations package to this parliament, it is very interesting to see what is actually going on in the workplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing in Geelong is a 17&hyphen;week secondary boycott of a well-known, very efficient wool scouring mill. We have a dispute between two unions; one is the AWU <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the other is the Shearers and Rural Workers Union run by Mr Steven Roach. The shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), might even know Mr Roach, because he is not too well liked by colleagues in the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AWU was the union covering this plant. Because Mr Stephen Roach wanted to get some members into his union, he brought about a dispute in the plant. After that situation arose, there was a secondary boycott.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had picketers on this plant for 17 weeks. The shadow minister at the table would understand the impact of that. Workers have been unable to come or go. As a result, half the work force has been sacked because it went on strike. The other half has been picketing. Police have been providing protection at shift changes so that this company can continue to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This situation exists under the current industrial relations arrangements in Australia. A rogue union seeking members has brought about a secondary boycott. Transport operators are afraid and unable to bring wool to the plant. I spoke to one personally. He said that he cannot go there or send his drivers to that plant because they throw stones at the truck and abuse the driver. He is no longer able to deliver wool to the plant. The plant is running at half production in fairly difficult financial times because of two unions having an internal dispute about the way in which they should represent the workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The secondary boycott will now no longer operate. Those who wish to supply the firm with wool ready for scouring are unable to. The company is working at half production. In terms of the final result, Mr Robinson's car has actually been torched. The article in the paper states of Mr Robinson:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, he said that such actions were not surprising bearing in mind the ongoing guerilla attacks he alleged were being waged against the company by its employees.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say later in the article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This is Australia and I believe our people have a right to work, but we can't defend ourselves against illegal and irresponsible activities . . .</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Picketers say they are being financially supported and their bills being paid by funds coming from other unions collected at sites in Geelong and Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA>So-called responsible unions are helping their mates keep other workers out of a job and force a very reputable wool scouring company to get into very serious financial difficulties because they have some internal problems. This is the position here in Australia. It has been brought about by attitudes generated by 100 years of industrial relations. It is a `them and us' situation, where the unions have undue power. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1996 is to protect the Sydney 2000 Olympics and Paralympic Games licensing revenue from being undermined by unauthorised use of the games indicia and images by corporate competitors of the official games sponsors. The bill will achieve this by regulating the use for commercial purposes of the indicia and images associated with the games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hosting of the Olympic Games in the year 2000 is an event of great significance to Australia. It provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate to the world this country's skills, talents, environment and achievements. Preparations for the games have proceeded in a very professional manner. This has been under the guidance of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, SOCOG, and with a high level of cooperation between the New South Wales state government and the Commonwealth government. The organisation of the games is an inspiring venture and the public interest in every aspect of the build&hyphen;up is intense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will ensure that the cooperation which has marked the first two years of preparation for the games continues. We will continue to cooperate with SOCOG and other agencies and organisations involved in organising the games. This cooperation is to ensure that Australia's competitors in the games are given every opportunity to succeed and that the games will be an outstanding success. The task of organising the games is very large and complex. It is also very expensive. As the host nation for the year 2000 games, Australia will be expending considerable sums of money in the lead&hyphen;up to the year 2000 for the construction of facilities and infrastructure, organisation and marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of staging the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games is estimated to be around $2 billion. It will be shared between the organising committees, SOCOG, and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee, SPOC, the government of NSW and the Commonwealth government. The Commonwealth government's overall budgetary contribution to the games will exceed $400 million. Sources of revenue to meet the costs of the Sydney Games include the sale of television rights, ticket sales and the licensing of the right to use the games indicia and images. After television rights, licensing or sponsorship rights are the most important source of revenue to meet the costs of organising and staging the games. It is expected that the revenue raised from official sponsorships would need to be of the order of $700 million to meet the revenue budget of the games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ability of SOCOG and SPOC to attract sponsors will depend to a large extent on the degree of exclusivity afforded to the licensed indicia and images. Official sponsors recognise the commercial value of associating themselves with events of the magnitude of the Olympic Games and are willing to pay considerable sums of money to use the words and symbols <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2476"> associated with the Olympics. In this regard, I note that SOCOG has announced that Telstra and IBM are to jointly contribute more than $100 million. They are the first members of Team Millennium, the corporate sponsorship program for the Sydney 2000 Games. The agreement was negotiated in anticipation of the strengthening of the legislative protection of intellectual property rights associated with the Sydney Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ambush marketing, however, has the capacity to seriously erode the official sponsorship revenue if not stopped or minimised. Ambush marketing is the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of an event, such as the Sydney Games, without paying for marketing rights. Typically it is the competitors of official sponsors of major sporting events that engage in these activities. Australian and overseas experience of recent Olympic Games has highlighted the threat that uncontrolled ambush marketing activities can pose to the value of exclusive licensing rights on Olympic Games symbols and indicia. Because ambush marketing can be very effective in creating a perception that the free&hyphen;rider is in fact an official sponsor, it can dissuade official sponsors from continuing their association with the Olympics. It can also substantially reduce the amount that sponsors are prepared to pay for the rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preservation of sponsorship revenue is fundamental to achieving a sound financial outcome for the games thereby ensuring the least call on the public purse. The government of NSW has underwritten and bears full responsibility for any deficit between the games income and expenditure. The protection of official sponsorships against ambush marketing is therefore critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms of the host city contract for the Sydney 2000 Olympics present obligations to the signatories for these matters. The host city, the New South Wales government, the Australian Olympic Committee and SOCOG are obliged to ensure that there are no other marketing programs in the host country which will have an impact on the games marketing program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures introduced to the chamber today are the result of a series of initiatives from the coalition parties. In 1994, the Liberal and National parties initiated an inquiry into the effects of ambush marketing on sponsorship revenue for the games. This followed early indications of serious problems for the organisers, the sponsors, and therefore ultimately the taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In February 1995 we announced we would support legislation to provide property rights in the words and expressions and names of bodies associated with the 2000 Games and the Paralympics. In March 1995 the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs unanimously supported this position. The AOC, SOCOG and the previous New South Wales government had called for this legislation from the time of awarding of the games to Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government introduced the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1995 into the Senate on 29 November 1995. It did not introduce it in time to make it law before the proroguing of parliament. This has created the very real risk of part of SOCOG's marketing revenue being siphoned off, with the cost being borne indirectly by Australian sport and the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill I am now introducing is essentially the same as the bill introduced into the Senate last year with the exception of three minor amendments. The amendments clarify the legislation and provide additional protection in accordance with the organising committees' wishes. It gives additional protection to that provided by the Olympic Insignia Protection Act <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2477"> 1987 which protects Olympic symbols such as the five rings and the designs of the Olympic flame and torch. That act was amended in 1994 to extend the protection available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new legislation will protect the use of a wide range of words and expressions against ambush marketing during the lead up to and including the Sydney Games. It will pick up most of the recommendations made in March 1995 by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cashing in on the Sydney Olympics: protecting the Sydney Olympic Games from ambush marketing</EMPHASIS>. The bill will have a limited period of application and will cease to have effect after 31 December 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now briefly outline significant features of this legislation. The bill seeks to provide protection to indicia encompassing words and expressions associated with the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Words and phrases such as `Olympic', `Olympiad', `Paralympic', `Paralympiad', `Sydney 2000', `Sydney Games', `Millennium Games', `Team Millennium' and `Summer Games' will be protected against unlicensed commercial use under this legislation. Particular word combinations will also be protected under this legislation. These include, for example, any combinations of the words `Olympics', `Olympian', `Paralympics' and `Paralympian' with words, numbers or phrases such as `Sydney', `2000', `Two Thousand', `Games', `Medals', `Gold', `Silver', `Bronze', `Green and Gold' and `Sponsor'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to protecting particular words, numbers and expressions, the bill also seeks to provide protection to certain images that in the circumstances of their presentation suggest, or are likely to suggest, a connection with the Sydney 2000 Olympic or Paralympic Games. These images may be either visual or aural representations. The rights in the above protected indicia and images vest with SOCOG and SPOC. These two bodies have the power to use and to license others to use the indicia and images identified in the legislation for commercial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To constitute use for commercial purposes, the Sydney Games indicia or images must be applied to a person's goods or services for advertising or promotional purposes, or for enhancing the demand for the goods or services, and in a manner which would suggest that the person is or has been a sponsor of, or is or has been providing other support for, the Sydney 2000 Olympic or Paralympic Games or both. That is, a person who sells or promotes their goods or services by using any of the protected indicia or images in a way that would be reasonably understood as suggesting that the person is claiming sponsorship of, or to be providing other support for the games, would be using them for commercial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to enable the public to be aware of the identity of those licensed to use the Sydney Games indicia and images, a register will be established and maintained by SOCOG. It will be made accessible to members of the public at its office in Sydney. The register will also be accessible throughout Australia at state offices of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation. An entry in the register will include details such as the name and principal place of business of the licensed user, the Sydney Games indicia and images that the licensed user may use, and the circumstances in which the indicia and images may be used. A person whose name is entered on the register is to be taken to be a licensed user of the Sydney Games indicia or images specified in that entry. A document certified by the chief executive officer of SOCOG is evidence that the particulars set out in the document are entered in the register.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, however, is not about placing an absolute fetter on any use of the protected Sydney Games indicia and images. The government recognises that the preservation of sponsorship revenue is essential to achieving a good budget outcome for the games. But the fundamental <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2478"> rights of the community to freedom of expression must be respected, particularly in relation to words that have passed into common usage. It must therefore be emphasised that restrictions on the usage of the Sydney Games indicia and images will apply only to unlicensed commercial use of the protected indicia and images.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, it is made clear in the bill that the legislation is not intended to affect the working of many aspects of everyday business. It is recognised that some individuals and corporations already use the indicia prescribed in the legislation in conjunction with their goods and services. There are, for example, goods and services which either have the trademark `Olympic' or include the word `Olympic'&mdash;such as Olympic tyres and Olympic Airways. This legislation is not about stopping traders who have been using these indicia and images for years from continuing that use. The established rights of owners of registered trademarks or designs containing those indicia and images remain unaffected, so long as the trademarks or designs are not used in a way so as to imply a connection to the games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of the Sydney Games indicia or images solely for the purposes of providing information, or for the purposes of criticism or review, is not of itself prohibited. Examples of such provision of information include the reporting of news and presentation of current affairs, the factual description of goods or services provided by a business, such as stating that accommodation is available at a hotel that is located near the Olympic site or the factual statements by an athlete to promote their own achievements. Examples of criticism and review are those which are likely to appear in newspapers, magazines or similar periodicals, in a radio or television broadcast, or in a cinematographic film.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises that the reasonable needs of sporting bodies in relation to fund raising for and promotion of their preparation of athletes and teams for the Sydney Olympic and Paralympic Games should be allowed to continue. Those reasonable needs could involve use of the Sydney Games indicia or images for the purposes of providing factual information. As I have just explained, the bill is not intended to affect this type of use. In the interests of clarity and certainty, the government believes it would be desirable for sporting bodies to negotiate memoranda of understanding with SOCOG to cover their proposed use of the Sydney Games indicia and images. The Australian Sports Commission has negotiated such an agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While strategies are being devised to ensure that new business opportunities will flow to all industries, including small and medium enterprises, the tourism industry in particular has the greatest contribution to make in securing and dispersing spin&hyphen;off benefits from the games. It has therefore been a major concern that the legislation does not inhibit the capacity of tourism marketing bodies and individual firms to undertake advertising and promotional activities which complement the role of SOCOG and the Olympic bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision of the information clause, which I have just mentioned, accommodates tourism marketing. That is, tourism marketing involving the provision of information that is both generic tourism promotion by official marketing bodies and factual statements about products and services by individual firms, should not require SOCOG's approval. Those tourism businesses wishing to become directly associated with the games will need to apply to SOCOG. The impact of the legislation on tourism marketing will be monitored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides various remedies to SOCOG, SPOC and licensed users to enforce their rights in relation to the Sydney Games indicia and images. Thus, where an unlicensed user uses Sydney Games indicia or images in contravention of the bill, SOCOG, SPOC or a relevant <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2479"> licensed user may bring an action against the unlicensed user. The remedies available under the bill include injunctions, damages and corrective advertising. However, in addition to those remedies, the courts have the discretion to provide remedies under any law (whether a law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory) that confers any rights or powers on SOCOG, SPOC or a licensed user. Most notable in this regard are the remedies provided under the Trade Practices Act 1974 in relation to engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also includes appropriate customs measures to limit the possibility of the importation of goods which seek to ambush the games marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ongoing cost to the government of administering this legislation will be minimal. The Australian Customs Service will be able to carry out the measures of this legislation relating to the monitoring of imported goods at the barrier within their existing resources. It is likely that the increased security of the Olympic 2000 indicia and images will enhance SOCOG's and SPOC's capacity to ensure the financial viability of the 2000 Games through its marketing program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the bill introduces significant protection for the Sydney Games indicia and images. The protection provided by this bill will both complement and enhance the protective measures already in place under Australia's current intellectual property laws to ensure, to the extent possible, that a good budget outcome is achieved for the Sydney 2000 Games. I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are very kind. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The opposition does not oppose the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1996. In fact, we wholeheartedly embrace it. As the honourable minister indicated, this particular bill with three minor changes in fact had been put before the parliament just before it was prorogued last year, and regrettably did not therefore receive passage. As a result, it has had to be put in again now. Clearly, because of all the reasons that the minister has espoused, it is a bill that should be supported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to pick up on a couple of the points that are there, though, because I do think it is extremely important that we not understate one or two very significant matters associated with the year 2000 Olympics in Sydney. Very recently, I had the opportunity to visit the Homebush site. If members of this parliament get the opportunity to organise a visit to the Olympic site at Homebush, I commend the visit. It is extremely enlightening to see the work that has already taken place and that is ongoing. It is a real eye&hyphen;opener to look at the plans that are in place and to look at the magnitude of the proposal which Australia was successful in obtaining.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2480">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, one of the things which concerns me a touch when talking about the Olympics, about marketing and about why we need this legislation in place to protect the indicia and the images associated with the Olympic Games is that maybe we place too much emphasis on the commercial aspect of the games. I had the opportunity to talk recently to Lois Appleby from the paralympic organisation here in Australia and she was telling me she has just come back from Atlanta. She said, `You would be surprised. The word "athlete" was hardly ever mentioned. What they were concerned about in Atlanta was Coca&hyphen;Cola sponsorship or sponsorship by AT&amp;T or sponsorship by Nike or Reebok, or whoever it might be that has gotten that sponsorship, and the athletes hardly rate a mention at the moment in Atlanta.' I think to some extent we might tend to lose sight of the fact that the modern Olympics are the ultimate test of the athleticism of men and women from around this globe brought together in the summer Olympics in a spirit of peace and harmony but certainly fierce competition. Perhaps it would not hurt for a few of us at least to continue to remind people that that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it still is important to protect the revenue raising ability of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and also the Sydney Paralympics Organising Committee and their opportunities to maximise revenue from the Olympics in the year 2000. It is important, because of what we have seen in past Olympic Games, for that to occur with a legislative base. There is no doubt that ambush marketing is something which could have a detrimental effect on the revenue capacity of the games and its organisers and therefore a consequential effect on whether the games are seen to be successful in terms of a dollar making ability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is said that when the bid was put forward by Sydney, with the support of the Australian government and of course the New South Wales government, very tight constraints were imposed on that bid in terms of budgeting. Part of that budgeting went to the issue of revenue that could be raised through the licensing of particular companies to sell products which were endorsed by the organising committees and which clearly carried some identifying logo relevant to the Olympic Games. Ambush marketing is defined as the unauthorised association by businesses of their names, brands, products or services with a sports event or competition through any one or more of a wide range of marketing activities. It is unauthorised in the sense that the controller of the commercial rights in such events, usually the relevant governing body, has neither sanctioned nor licensed the association itself or through its commercial agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is really what our concern is about in respect of this legislation. What we are concerned about is the fact that the Olympic Games in Sydney are estimated to cost between $2 billion and $3 billion, and there is some $700 million expected to be raised from commercial sponsorship. That commercial sponsorship is going to be an underpinning feature of meeting budget commitments and ensuring that the facilities that are going to have to be built on the way through are in fact ready in time and are leading edge facilities. That is happening now. As I said, take the opportunity to go and have a look at what is happening at Homebush and you will see for yourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some licences have been announced already, particularly for a whole range of clothing, from underwear through to tracksuits. A whole range of preferred suppliers have been licensed by SOCOG at the present time. I think that is appropriate. That shows why you need to protect those people that have been given a licence to manufacture products and put the Olympic logos on them for Sydney and have some revenue raised in that respect. But it goes further. As we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2481"> know, large commercial sponsorships from organisations, whether they be telecommunications carriers, banks, airlines or whatever, are just around the corner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, people are paying substantial amounts of money to be the up&hyphen;front premier sponsors of the Sydney Olympics, and they want recognition for it. They are not going to throw hundreds of millions of dollars into this to let somebody else come along and by some sleight of hand, or by the use of the Olympic rings, or the torch, or by talking about gold or silver sponsorships&mdash;as the minister outlined in his second reading speech&mdash;having a de facto sponsorship and therefore giving the indication in the minds of some that they are official sponsors. Only the ones that are licensed by the organisations mentioned have that responsibility; only they have the right to market themselves in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some exemptions contained within this legislation, and the minister mentioned those. I want to reinforce the point that businesses already using prescribed words or symbols&mdash;such as Olympic Airways&mdash;can continue to do so providing, of course, that they do not link themselves specifically to these games. They are permitted the use of prescribed words in news and current affairs reporting. Factual information, tour operators and hotels are the examples that the minister used. I think that is absolutely correct. You cannot stop the genuine need for news broadcasts to refer to the Sydney Olympics or to talk about it and, clearly, this bill makes the necessary exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what we do not want is to get into some of the ambush marketing that occurred in some previous Olympics. For example, the Nike&hyphen;Reebok sneakers war during the 1992 Barcelona summer Olympics saw members of the gold medal winning USA basketball dream team, with personal sponsorships from Nike, threatening to boycott the medal presentation rather than wear the official team uniform featuring Nike's rival, Reebok. That sort of thing should not be allowed to happen again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the Barcelona Olympics General Motors Holden advertised that it would give a golden Holden to any gold medal winner, despite Toyota's exclusive deal of sponsorship. These are some of the examples where I think it is important that protection is given to those people and those large businesses that are putting many tens of millions of dollars, if not hundreds of millions, towards the Sydney Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question about memorandums of understanding being signed between sports and organisations has some merit, and I think the minister is absolutely right to highlight that. There are already some examples with the Australian Olympic Committee where that is happening, and I commend the minister's action as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not delay consideration or passage of this bill. As I said, the opposition wholeheartedly supports it. It had its genesis when we were the government in the last parliament, and regrettably, it did not get passed in time. It has a sunset clause; it will conclude at the conclusion of the Olympic Games and I think that that is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude by commending both John Coates, from the Australian Olympic Committee, and Michael Knight, the minister in New South Wales responsible for the Olympics. Those two have the highest public profile when it comes to the Olympics at this stage. They have negotiated an extremely fair and reasonable set of circumstances for year 2000 Olympics, particularly in respect of the matter of ongoing sponsorship. Michael Knight has one eye, quite obviously, on the finances of the state government of New South Wales&mdash;as any responsible minister would have&mdash;and John Coates, an absolutely dynamic, committed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2482"> individual for the Australian Olympic movement for many years, has his eye on protecting Australia's Olympic interests into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both of them have been accommodating, and both have accommodated the need for commercial sponsorship. I think that this bill, which was discussed previously with the organising committees and which has been discussed before this parliament, is something which reflects very well on the New South Wales government and, in particular, on Michael Knight, the Australian Olympic Committee and John Coates. And we should not forget the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and the Sydney Paralympics Organising Committee. Those people also have been well and truly involved in the negotiations on what the structure of this bill should be and the way in which the outcomes of the bill, in terms of protection of sponsorship, will enhance those organisations. They have been given the primary responsibility for ensuring that the Olympic 2000 games are successful. They need to be successful for Australia for all the reasons that we know. Not only do the games give us a chance to showcase our own Olympic athletic prowess, but they also&mdash;as the minister at the table would know&mdash;give us that opportunity between now and then, and subsequently, to market Australia more broadly as a destination for international tourists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to make sure that we get it right and that we turn on games the likes of which the world has never seen. I think we can. After all, it is going to be in one of the best cities in the world. I think we would all agree with that. Even my Tasmanian colleague, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), would agree with that. I think it is important that we ensure that this legislation gets a speedy passage through the House. I wish it success.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Shadow Minister for Sport and Tourism, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), for his recognition of the fact that I think Sydney is a great city. I do, in fact, think it is a great city&mdash;second only, of course, to Launceston. I can see that the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has been putting in a bid for Hobart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to speak on the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill in my capacity as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games, in which capacity I have an overarching responsibility for all matters Olympic as we go forward, and also in my capacity as Minister for Sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sydney Olympic and Paralympic Games are already a major focus for sports development in Australia. This focus is not only on Olympic sports and elite Olympic athletes; it is also proving to be the focus for grassroots participation development and in many cases for non&hyphen;Olympic sports. We ought not to forget that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sporting community as a whole is excited about the Olympics and enthusiastic about the contribution the games will make to the development of sport in our country. The whole community shares this enthusiasm. It is important for Australia and Australian sport that these games are a success. The commitment by the shadow minister and the work of others whom he mentioned are certainly recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the critical factors in the success of the games is the ability of the organisers, SOCOG and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee, known as SPOC, to raise the funds necessary to host the games. That is certainly a massive task. The budget for simply hosting the games is nearly $2 billion&mdash;not including construction of facilities. Of that, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2483"> SOCOG is looking to raise somewhere in the vicinity of $650 million from official games sponsors, licensing and marketing. If SOCOG falls short of raising enough money to host the games, then the New South Wales taxpayers will be required to foot the bill. SOCOG's ability to meet the target relies to a large extent on the degree of exclusivity an official sponsor will gain over games indicia and images. That is the reason for this bill, which enjoys very strong bipartisan support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) went into some of the detail of the legislation. I shall not traverse that same territory. Let me refer to ambush marketing, which is the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of an event. Typically, the ambush marketer seeks to gain some benefit by suggesting that it is associated with the event without paying for those rights. It is emerging as a bit of a problem in Atlanta already, I understand. We want to try to avoid that problem occurring here. Ambush marketing can have a severe impact on exclusivity and consequently on the ability of SOCOG to raise the necessary funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In keeping with our strong commitment to support the Sydney Olympic Games, the coalition recognised, as did the former government, that legislation was necessary to protect the Sydney Olympics from ambush marketing. As early as February 1995, we announced that we would support legislation to protect the games from ambush marketing. Our 1996 sports policy committed the government to `enact strong and effective Olympic anti&hyphen;ambush marketing legislation in consultation with the Australian Olympic Committee.' I am pleased to say that this legislation implements our election commitment and mirrors almost exactly the draft legislation that the previous government put forward. Those consultations have been extremely positive. I hope that this is the beginning of a very positive and cooperative relationship at all levels of government and with all in the broader Olympic family as we all work as a nation to deliver a very successful games in the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister covered most of the detail of the legislation, and I do not propose to repeat those details. Naturally, however, with the games four years away, the situation is still evolving. The government is discussing with SOCOG and other parties some additional requests for protection. This may result in further amendments to the legislation being required to be brought to this place. Despite the possible need for later amendments, it was clear that the need to have protection in place prior to the Atlanta games made the immediate introduction of this legislation necessary. So we are particularly pleased to be dealing with that matter today and we are pleased that the opposition has already signalled its strong support. I am confident that the government's prompt action on the legislation will put the Sydney games organisers in the best possible position to secure the revenue needed to finance the games. That is an issue that will be concerning all of us. This is a very vital piece of legislation to enable them to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the most important issue and the greatest challenge for the government was to draft legislation which would give SOCOG and SPOC the protection they deserve without producing unintended consequences. The intention is quite clear: unscrupulous people should not be able to cash in on the Olympics when they have made no contribution to supporting the event. The official sponsors and licensees need to be sure that they are not going to have their marketing advantage or their market taken from them. This goes for the biggest sponsor in the corporate category right through to the person producing Sydney Olympics pens.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2484">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as sports minister, I believe it was also important to ensure that the legislation did not unduly restrict the legitimate activities of sporting organisations and individual athletes. For an athlete, a blanket restriction on the use of the words `Olympic', `Olympian' or `Olympic gold medallist', for example, might have serious detrimental effects. Most Olympic athletes make huge financial sacrifices to get to the top of their sport. Very few have time to undertake normal work and, as a result, most defer their careers and their financial security for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those athletes, the opportunity to gain sponsorship or market themselves as Olympic athletes brings a small recompense for the years of effort they have put in. Very few athletes have the stature or earning potential of, say, a Kieren Perkins but, as an example, just imagine how his earning potential would be affected if he were prohibited from promoting himself as an Olympic gold medallist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the involvement of the Australian Sports Commission in the development of the legislation, I am confident that the rights of athletes will be preserved by the legislation. Under the legislation, athletes will be able to make a factual statement of their performance or achievements, subject to any other agreements they might sign. This means that an athlete who is a member of the Atlanta Olympic Games team will be able to describe himself or herself as an Olympian or an Olympic athlete and, if that athlete is fortunate enough to win a gold medal, as an Olympic gold medallist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sporting organisations also had the potential to be affected by the legislation. The Olympic sporting organisations, for example, may have perfectly legitimate uses for words such as `Olympic' or `Olympic team'. Once again, these organisations will be able to make factual statements. Olympic sporting organisations are already obliged by an Australian Olympic Committee by&hyphen;law to observe certain restrictions in the use of Olympic words and symbols. As a result, this legislation should not prove unduly restrictive on the activities of Olympic sporting organisations. The government was obviously also concerned to ensure that the Australian Sports Commission and particularly the Australian Institute of Sport were able to continue their legitimate promotion and fundraising activity in the lead&hyphen;up to the games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, through the Australian Sports Commission, is making by far the biggest financial contribution to the development of our Olympic athletes. The $135 million Olympic athlete program, combined with other funding, is crucial for the development of our team. It is reasonable to expect that the commission should be able to gain credit for its role and its expertise. In addition, the ASC raises approximately $10 million per annum from a combination of program revenue, other funding and sponsorships to supplement government funding. The government believes the ASC should be able to continue to attract sponsor support, and should not be unduly restricted by the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the discussions which led to this legislation, it was clear that some uses the AIS might have wished to make of protected indicia or images might have constituted a breach of the legislation. The AIS may, for example, wish to state that it is `training athletes for the Sydney 2000 Games'&mdash;a factual statement, but one which might have breached the legislation. To ensure that the Australian Sports Commission's legitimate uses are protected, the commission has negotiated with SOCOG a memorandum of understanding governing the use of protected indicia and images.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The MOU sets out the purposes and circumstances under which the commission can use protected indicia or images. It also includes a dispute resolution procedure in the unlikely event <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2485"> that a disagreement should arise. The MOU has continued the very positive and constructive working relationship which has developed between the Australian Sports Commission and SOCOG, a relationship which I am confident will continue over the next four years as the government works with SOCOG to ensure that the Sydney Olympic Games are a success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation is a tangible sign of the government's commitment to ensuring that the Sydney 2000 Games are a success. It adds to a broader range of assistance that the government is currently providing. As Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games, I have as one of my tasks to be involved in the coordination of the Commonwealth's involvement in the games. My appointment by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to this position, in addition to being Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, is another important sign of the government's commitment to having a cooperative, coordinated approach to all that is going to be required to ensure that the games are a success.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Slipper. The range of assistance from the Commonwealth is very broad. Apart from financial assistance of $150 million, paid already by agreement between both major parties in this country for construction of facilities, $135 million for the preparation of athletes&mdash;which I have already mentioned&mdash;and $25 million towards staging the Paralympics, the Commonwealth is providing assistance with land for the Olympic village, drug testing, security, immigration, Customs and quarantine, health care, coin issue, communications and transport, and promotion of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I predict that, over the period, very few areas of government will remain untouched by games activity and there needs to be a positive approach from all of us. I hope to ensure also that very few Australians will remain untouched by the overall Olympic experience. We need to ensure that it is not just Sydney that is going to see the benefit of the games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill we are debating today will help to ensure that the staging of the games themselves will be a success. The government's commitment to Olympic athlete development will help to ensure that our athletes' performances will be successful. The third element of a successful games is to ensure that they produce benefits for all Australians. Later this year the government will announce how it is to implement its 2000 Plus election commitment. 2000 Plus will ensure that Australians in all states and territories benefit from Sydney hosting the 2000 Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicated when I commenced my remarks that the 2000 Games were proving to be a focus for the whole sporting community. The challenge is to utilise the focus on 2000 to ensure that, after 2000, we have a legacy of a fitter, more active society, a more professional sports industry and a range of ongoing economic and social benefits. These games will be a wonderful experience for all Australians and for the sporting community in particular. I am pleased that, through this bill, the government will be making a very substantial contribution to ensuring that the games are a success, and doing so in a very timely fashion in advance of the Atlanta Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate my colleague the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) for the work he and his department have done in putting together this piece of legislation which is quite complex. I also thank the opposition shadow spokesman, and the opposition generally, for the support they have given; originally, of course, it was their bill. I also congratulate&mdash;as did the shadow minister&mdash;the work of SOCOG who are tasked with a major undertaking on behalf of the nation, the government of New South Wales, the minister, Mr Knight&mdash;who also has a major task&mdash;the Australian Olympic Committee and Mr John Coates who, incidentally, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2486"> is chef de mission for the Atlanta Games and also deputy chair of the Australian Sports Commission. There are very good and positive links between the sporting funding arrangements federally and the Olympic Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also congratulate all the other Commonwealth departments and the members of the special group within the Prime Minister's department who work with me on dealing with all the other matters that need to be dealt with for the very constructive way that we have undertaken a long and often complex negotiation on this particular legislation. It augurs well for a very positive approach to all the necessary difficulties and issues that we are going to need to address as we go forward to the year 2000 and the Olympic Games. I, too, commend the bill to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to make what I intend to be a short contribution to this debate on the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1996. I do so because I think the balance has been struck in a way which is quite defensible. It enables protection of the commercial sponsors of the Olympic Games, but does not include some of the provisions that might have been thought to offend against the rights of individual athletes and critics and others who may wish to engage in some debate about the sporting event, in a way that was the case with the bicentennial legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have taken the opportunity to speak in this debate because I have a small personal history in the litigation that was conducted against the bicentennial legislation. At the time before my election in 1987, I spent some period as principal solicitor for the Aboriginal Legal Service. They were under instructions from an Aboriginal small business person who wanted to make certain statements on tee&hyphen;shirts he was manufacturing. The statements expressed some antagonism towards the spirit of the bicentennial, and pointed out that, as well as the 200 years of European settlement in Australia which the nation was celebrating, there was a period of 200 years of dispossession which Aboriginal Australians were concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the ways in which the bicentennial act had been constructed would have prohibited the use of free speech and the use of expressions in common use. I was responsible for drafting the action and for appearing in the High Court before the then Chief Justice Sir Harry Gibbs. But by the time the case actually came on to the final determination I had become a member of parliament, and I was spared having to agitate for the case before the full court of the High Court, which heard it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The points which we had raised, however, were successful in Davis v. Commonwealth, which is reported in 63 ALR 35. It is an interesting case, because the High Court, in a sense, anticipates its later decisions in terms of implied freedoms of speech&mdash;doctrines which have been the subject of some considerable controversy since that time. But, whatever the merits or otherwise of that stream of judicial law making, it is appropriate to reflect on the substance of what the court said, which is that it is inappropriate for legislation to go beyond what is a legitimate extension of the Commonwealth's interests in providing the lawful and appropriate protection, in the commercial sense, of the symbols.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased at the balance that the bill has established. As the minister indicated, this is legislation that was introduced by the former government and has been picked up&mdash;without any change at all&mdash;by the incoming government. It will prevent abuse of the commercial interests of those persons participating as sponsors in the Olympic Games. But it will not have the far reach of previous attempts to protect symbols, which were brought undone in the Davis v. Commonwealth case, for example, during the bicentennial.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2487">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I might say that the victory that my clients had in Davis v. Commonwealth was entirely pyrrhic. By the time the High Court had decided its case, the bicentennial year had concluded.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. One of the areas where the Australian public can get behind the national Olympic effort is in the policing of the anti&hyphen;ambush marketing laws spelt out in the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1996. This bill reflects one of the great features of Australian culture and society: having a fair go. With so much potential investment in the commercial sponsorship side of the Sydney Olympics&mdash;an expected $700 million&mdash;it is only fair that we do the best we can to ensure the commercial sponsors are given a fair go for their dollars. If we were to open the Olympic name and symbol to everyone to capitalise on we would very quickly lose the meaning behind the name and the meaning behind the symbol.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, probably, Mr Martin. Half&hyphen;time breaks are generally brought to you by one group or another, as are the man of the match, try of the match, most valuable player and so on. The Olympic Games are big business and there can be no doubt about it. But it does not have to become overcommercialised; that will cheapen the event. I smiled to myself when I went through the submission prepared by the New South Wales government and the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games when this bill was in its infancy. In their appendix they list a range of business names that have been applied for since 1993 when Sydney won the bid to host the games. At the top of the list is the business name `Sydney 2000 Olympic Condoms'. I am no advertising whiz but I can imagine the advertising campaign that would have been based around the Olympic motto `citius, altius, fortius' or `swifter, higher, stronger'. It does not take much of an imagination to see what they probably had in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the upcoming Atlanta Olympics, where the corporate dollar funds the event almost 100 per cent, the Sydney Olympics will be funded to a large extent by the taxpayer. The New South Wales state government has agreed to pick up the shortfall in funding for the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. With taxpayers already footing part of the Olympic bill, I am sure they will not be pleased if we do not ensure that sponsors maximise returns on their investments and minimise the chance of further demands on the state or federal governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we should be trying to do in Australia is to encourage sponsorship investment in sporting events. Why should the taxpayer always have to carry a large part of the bill? Tight laws protecting or limiting the use of key words, phrases and images associated with the Sydney Olympics encourage and protect that investment. Estimates suggest that about 1.4 million visitors will pass through Atlanta next month for the Olympics there; thousands of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2488"> millions more will be watching the games on television worldwide. It is a very tempting advertising market and the potential rewards for successfully tapping it are huge. No doubt the temptation will prove too much for some and they will try to make a serious dollar or two by illegally associating themselves with the Olympic Games or the Olympic symbol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games is awarding 45 product licences under a $1 billion retail and marketing deal. Late last month the committee awarded the first seven licences; the top sponsors invested about $40 million each for exclusive product rights. Each of the companies is expected, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, to generate about $400 million in retail sales in the run&hyphen;up to the Sydney Games. The games organising committee estimates that the sale of lapel pins alone for the Sydney 2000 Games could be up to 20 million units. The committee will be taking a 15 per cent cut from the revenue; this is approximately $50 to $60 million, depending on the final gross.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp said, in the second reading of the bill, that the revenue raised from official sponsorship would need to be of the order of $700 million to be in line with budget expectations for the games. In July 1994, the New South Wales government and the Sydney organising committee produced a joint submission for the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on Olympic related words and symbols. In that submission it stated that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Commonwealth government fails to implement the proposed legislative protection, there could be a serious threat to the financial viability of the Sydney 2000 Games. . . The amount that sponsors will be willing to contribute to the Sydney 2000 Games will depend on the sponsors' degree of confidence that their sponsorship exclusivity will be protected by Australian laws.</PARA>
<PARA>The games organising committee would have a difficult time attracting such sponsors if it were not for tough laws preventing or deterring ambush marketing. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , there are about 850 companies interested in trying to get one of the 45 product licences. The interest is certainly there, but only because of the prospect of laws to protect companies once they get the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Atlanta, the committee has established a $10 million budget to police ambush marketing tactics and people or companies trying to make an illegal buck from the 1996 Olympics. The team they have set up for this includes private investigators, media monitors, volunteers and market researchers. Their job is to identify and stop ambushers and people engaging in the production of counterfeit Olympic paraphernalia. They have invested $10 million to give protection to licensed sponsors. Sport is a big commercial money&hyphen;spinner; the Olympics is the biggest game around and it is only going to get bigger. The worldwide television rights for the Montreal Olympics went for about $US32 million; the Atlanta rights have gone for $US900 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My home city of Townsville stepped into the Olympic spotlight last week when members of the Australian Olympic track and field team travelled north for training and acclimatisation sessions before heading off to Atlanta.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">James Cook University's sports science department specialises in the effects of hot and humid weather on sportsmen and sportswomen. The head of the sports department, Dr Robert Griffiths, said that JCU had been able to offer the Atlanta&hyphen;bound athletes advanced blood analysis technology. This monitors their bodies during training and their recovery rates after extensive training in the challenging climate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">James Cook's sports science department will be a key link in making Townsville an international centre for acclimatisation research and training. Dr Griffiths said that the department has been in close contact with the Australian Institute of Sport and has been able to offer valuable input, based on sophisticated blood test results, of the effects of heat and stress on athletes. Dr Griffiths has also expressed his interest in extending the department's facilities to other areas, such as the Australian Defence Force. The rigorous training they go through could be enhanced through the use of the facilities at the neighbouring James Cook University.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the vast majority of people are in favour of this bill, some groups have argued against it, saying that there is no way to accurately measure whether these seemingly anti&hyphen;competitive laws are of real benefit. Surely, they say, it would be more lucrative to open competition up to everyone and allow all business to benefit from being able to use the Olympic Games names, phrases and images. I do not think so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all have to realise that, in the lead&hyphen;up to the Sydney Olympic Games, Australian businesses and tourism are going to benefit regardless. They will continue to benefit, although not at the same level, when the Games have passed to another country. No matter how hard we try, we cannot force tourists and visitors coming to Australia to shop in one shop, buy one label of clothing, eat at one food outlet, or use the film of one company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tens of thousands of tourists who will flood into every city in Australia will have to eat food, buy clothing, watch television, take pictures, travel to and from places, and they will do it through a multitude of different companies and businesses. The major sponsors will hold a special position, but then they have invested the money. This bill protects that investment. I commend the bill to the Main Committee and look forward to its recommendation to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The original modern Olympic Games organised by Pierre de Coubertin in 1896 was attended by 311 athletes from 13 countries who competed in 43 events in nine sports. At the Atlanta Games from 19 July until 4 August this year, 10,768 athletes from 197 countries will compete in over 600 events, 37 disciplines, and 26 sports. Some 40,000 volunteers will look after two million visitors and 11 million ticket holders. Some 140,580 rooms will be cleaned, 8,679 kilometres of toilet paper will be used, 727,272 kilograms of linen will be laundered&mdash;that is a stack about 4.8 kilometres high&mdash;and 110,200 towels will be used. Some two million soft drinks will be sold, and 890 litres of steak sauce, 950,000 apples, 30 kilometres of aluminium foil, 3&half; million serviettes and 90 kilograms of garlic will be used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From its humble beginnings in Athens, the modern Olympic Games has become a major commercial event. To ignore this commercial reality is to commit your bureaucracy to years of debt, as Montreal did in 1976. The city of Montreal will be paying off the 1976 games well into the next century: great games, but a financial disaster. In fact, the result was so bad for the IOC that they had great difficulty in attracting cities to bid for the 1984 games. Luckily, LA came to the rescue and we had the 1984 games which set the scene for the games today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2490">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IOC has three aims: firstly, to ensure the regular celebration of the games, to make sure that they actually occur; secondly, to make them increasingly perfect, more and more worthy of their glorious past and in keeping with the high ideals that inspired those who revived the games; and, thirdly, to encourage and organise all events, taking all steps likely to lead modern athletes along the right lines.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GK6">Miss JACKIE KELLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is our aim. In order to ensure the continued celebration of the games all over the world and not just in large nations, a commercial approach was taken to the LA Olympics. The sporting, commercial and financial success of the LA Olympics ensured the event for years to come. Therefore, this parliament must do everything in its power to ensure the financial success of the Sydney Games in the year 2000. Failure to do this would discourage other cities from holding the games. To make the games even better and more and more worthy of their glorious past, and to organise all events and accommodate the growing number of athletes and events&mdash;the number of athletes has grown from 300 in 1896 to over 10,000 in the 23 times that the games have been held&mdash;is going to take more and more money, so protection of all areas of revenue is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before potential sponsors commit themselves to pay about $40 million per category for exclusive rights, we need to assure them that they are protected from ambush or parasitic marketing practices by commercial rivals. The image we must give to international businesses is that we are up to speed on current business practices and marketing techniques such as those covered by this bill. It is said in advertising that you never get a second chance to make a first impression, and the hosting of the games will introduce many overseas companies to the Australian market for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be remembered that the people of New South Wales are committed to covering the costs of the games and, in effect, have purchased the product of the Olympic Games for a short period. We must ensure that they are able to maximise their returns from the valuable product, and the Olympic Games insignia, as a marketing device, are very valuable assets. We must continue to display the level of professionalism and strategic foresight displayed by Mr John Fahey and his team in the successful bid to host the Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must prepare ourselves to harvest the fruits of such a boon, and the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1996 is just such a measure. The bill will contribute to the success of these games and help to protect the citizens of New South Wales and the athletes of Australia. It is important that we do not place the people of Sydney and New South Wales under unnecessary financial burdens as a result of the Olympics. The New South Wales government has committed itself to picking up the tab for many shortfalls from SOCOG's funding; we do not want to be like the citizens of Montreal after the year 2000. The hosting of the Olympic Games is a big business and, as an international event, many overseas companies will be interested in sponsorship deals with SOCOG. These deals will go a long way to covering the more than $3 billion needed to stage the games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Sydney will benefit greatly from the boost to infrastructure that will result from our hosting of the games. I am happy to say that the people of Lindsay will be hosting the rowing events at the Penrith Lakes and the Nepean River is the training venue for the rowing teams. In Penrith, we have the fastest growing junior basketball region in the state of New South Wales. Therefore, our area would make a great location for one of the basketball venues. The young people of Lindsay would love to see the basketballers of the US dream <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2491"> team in our area. Such infrastructure is invaluable for a community such as ours and the Olympic Games give the people of Lindsay the unique opportunity to be involved in the greatest international sporting event in the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, they are. The Sydney Games will allow the people of Lindsay the opportunity to present our area as a wonderful tourist destination to the people of Australia and to the world. The international visitors and worldwide television audience will have the pleasure of watching events held in our area and see the beauty of the Nepean River against the backdrop of the imposing Blue Mountains escarpment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What of the athletes themselves? The definition of `amateur' has gone by the board. The training required to reach Olympic standard today is almost full&hyphen;time. The commitment and sacrifice is huge and the athletes should be able to realise financial reward for their efforts. All too often we lose talented young athletes in their late teens or early twenties because they can no longer rely on parental support; they must support themselves. They must look to their future careers. All too often their chosen sport is unable to provide their pay cheque. They find themselves turning to other avenues and other careers in order to get a pay cheque.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know, because in 1988 I was faced with a similar decision. I was a struggling athlete. I had represented Australia at the senior B level and I had dreamed of representing Australia in Seoul. That was my ambition for about two years. I had a full&hyphen;time job. I was spending most of my income on my rowing equipment. I was studying part-time to keep my university studies relevant and I was training five hours a day. So was the rest of my crew. We were not amateurs and we did not get AIS sponsorship. In 1988 we won a national title, only to be told there were insufficient funds to send a women's team to the lead&hyphen;up regattas, let alone to the Olympics in Seoul. I left rowing to follow a military career: I needed the pay cheque.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I still have the dream that the Olympics will be the battlefield of the future, that nations will sort out their differences and aggressions on the sporting fields and abide by the umpire's decision. It is possible to use the Olympics for political ends and, except for the Munich Games, such exercising of political will does not have the enormous cost to human life that military action does. Winning an Olympic medal brings great kudos to your country. To give our athletes the best chance of reaching the world No. 1 ranking in their sport we must provide all the financial assistance we can. We need to encourage and safeguard sponsors' rights and promote private investment in our games and our athletes. The more young sportsmen who can make a living out of their sport instead of a military career, the closer to my dream we will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is the start of financially rewarding careers in sport in Australia. May I remind the House of an Olympic motto: the most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win, but to take part. Do not let us take financial constraints as any reason for athletes not to be able to participate at this level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The physical activity of our young and upcoming athletes teaches them the discipline that they can maintain right throughout life. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I might just take the opportunity to sum up on behalf of the minister who is absent launching a spaceship somewhere. I thank those who have contributed to the debate. I have listened to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2492"> the contributions of Mr Martin, Mr Kerr, Mr Lindsay and Miss Kelly. Mr Martin was particularly positive about the legislation. Mr Kerr told an interesting story about his High Court appearances. He won the case but, because the decision was made well after the bicentenary, he was unable to get the benefit for his clients. But particularly I want to thank Mr Lindsay and Miss Kelly. Mr Lindsay indicated in his remarks that the Olympic Games can be an opportunity for a broad benefit for all Australia. What has happened in sports medicine at James Cook University in Townsville with the visiting Olympians who went there for climate activity prior to going to Atlanta is an indication of what can happen in the Sydney 2000 Games. We must ensure that all areas of Australia are going to be able to participate in some positive way and that those communities are going to get the benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was particularly interesting to note that the TV rights&mdash;and this is the genus of what this legislation is about, providing marketing protection&mdash;in Montreal cost $32 million whereas in Atlanta they cost $900 million. Quite an extraordinary amount of money has now been paid. It is very much an international event. We ought not to forget here in Australia that when the games take place here and coincide with the change in the millennium that we are going to be showcasing Australia to the rest of the world through our sporting endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Lindsay made a very interesting contribution. I had not realised that she had committed so much to rowing. We are very lucky to have her in the House and her contribution was particularly positive. You will find, of course, there is some similarity between rowing and politics in that you look one way and go another. Do not take that as being a negative remark. I also was a rower but I did not last very long. I thought the contribution by the honourable member was very positive and I thank her for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, as all speakers pointed out, will provide significant protection for the 2000 Games. It is particularly important, as I have said and as did the minister, to have this done at such an expeditious time in advance of Atlanta. The whole issue of protecting the games licensing revenue from ambush marketing was originally brought to the parliament by Senator Ian Campbell, a Western Australian senator who prior to the election was also shadow minister for sport. He moved a motion that the matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs back in June 1994. He is now the parliamentary secretary in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was through that initiative that this legislation came about. The committee was chaired by another Western Australian lawyer, Senator Chris Ellison, and it brought down a unanimous report supporting the introduction of this legislation to protect the games revenue from ambush marketing and here we are in 1996 putting it into effect through the committee process with a report now to the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been particularly conscious, in preparing the legislation, to give the games organisers the best possible protection without unduly inhibiting the legitimate operations of business. There is always a fine balance to be struck. We believe we have got it right. As I mentioned in my speech, there may be a necessity to bring in some further amendments to refine the matter but at this stage we think we have got it about right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of commercial firms have been using the word `Olympic' as a business name and as a trademark for many years. This legislation is not about stopping traders from continuing with those legitimate uses. Traders may not, however, use the word in a way as to suggest a connection with the games unless they are duly licensed. Indeed, the member for Herbert <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2493"> (Mr Lindsay) gave us some examples of what had taken place yesterday with the 45 licences that have been issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We wanted to make sure that there was a proper balance between the rights of the games organisers to protect that licensing revenue and the existing rights of members of the public and the wider business community. We believe that that protection provided by the bill will complement and enhance the protective measures already in place under Australia's current intellectual property laws and that it will help to ensure that a good budget outcome is achieved for the Sydney 2000 Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay tribute to the people in the minister's department in the intellectual property law area who had the prime responsibility for preparing this legislation. It is complex. There is keen interest in the definitional aspects and I think they have done a particularly good job. With those words, I thank again those who have contributed to a very positive debate and discussion of this matter. On behalf of the absent minister I can say that I hope that this matter can now proceed to the House of Representatives without amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While we are in the mood for taking a very bipartisan approach to all matters associated with sport generally, let me indicate to the honourable the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) at the outset that the opposition wholeheartedly supports this particular legislation, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1996, as well. I am particularly delighted to be speaking in support of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ever since the Australian Sports Drug Agency was established in 1990, each time some legislation has come before this parliament I have taken an opportunity to speak in support of it. I have done so because at the time when there was a Senate committee&mdash;or it might even have been the drugs in sport inquiry, which was chaired by Senator John Black from Queensland&mdash;I was chairing another inquiry in the House of Representatives into the funding and administration of sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a degree of overlap in there, and occasionally there was a little bit of confusion about which committee was actually responsible for what part. But at the end of the day, the drugs in sport report, which came down in May 1990, saw the Australian Sports Drug Agency established. In the Department of the Parliamentary Library Parliamentary Research Service brief, Bills Digest No. 103 of 1995&hyphen;96, entitled `The Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1996'&mdash;and I go to that length so that I am not accused of stealing anybody else's words here&mdash;it indicates on page 2 that ASDA's mission is to ensure that Australian athletes are able to compete in sport which is free from banned doping practices. The agency's vision is to be one of the leading sports agencies in the world and to achieve excellence as a small statutory authority.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2494">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say from personal experience&mdash;not by being tested, but by involvement through my rugby league club, through the rugby league generally and through a number of other sports&mdash;that that vision has been achieved now and is appropriate, and that its mission is also being achieved. As an organisation, it is at the leading edge and one which the rest of the world could look to. It is not a secret, and I am not saying anything to anybody in this room that is not already known, that Australians have always prided themselves on their athleticism, their love of sport and the fact that they had always wanted to see that they were competing on equal and drug&hyphen;free terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that we have always championed in this country is drug&hyphen;free sport. We have seen some fairly famous cases involving Australians where our credentials in this area have been open to scrutiny. The drugs in sport inquiry was largely started because of an Australian athlete who maintained that the caffeine level in his body was related to his intake of several cups of coffee before he participated in his event. As a result of that there were all sorts of activities undertaken at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most recently we have seen the Sam Riley case. Could you ever take a more Australian Australian, someone as dedicated as Sam Riley, somebody as a role model, and say that simply because she took a headache tablet that contained a banned substance, she deserved to be banned? Incidentally, as I understand it, the substance was not performance enhancing but was, in fact, exactly the opposite. It was something designed to slow down performance. Yet she was faced at one stage with a possible ban, and we have seen a ban being imposed on her coach.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given that Australia has been such a vocal opponent of drugs in sport, calling for testing when we saw the pictures of the Chinese swimming team, for example&mdash;I would not mind a couple of them playing for the Illawarra Steelers as front rowers, but they were swimmers&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we saw them, we were actually critical of that. There is a view around that suggests that the international authorities thought that because an Australian was involved in this, they should make an example of her&mdash;`Let us just see how the Australians like it when a particular ruling is given against them'. I hope that the international authorities are bigger than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that Sam's swimming coach has got to suffer that ban. It has been reduced, I know, but he still has that ban. Fortunately, he is still able to coach. But, whilst he might be in Atlanta, he is not going to be poolside, and that is a great shame. Fortunately for Australia, and fortunately for Sam Riley, she has been able to get above this and put it behind her. She is training extremely well. She was given an Order of Australia award in the recent announcements, which I think is a great recognition of a superb Australian. Yet she has had to go through so much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that what we in this country have done is matched the rhetoric of our absolute opposition to drugs in sport with some positive action. The government is to be commended for bringing this bill forward, because what it is doing is enhancing our ability to test not only Australian athletes but also those from overseas countries, and to put into place a number of arrangements which perhaps have existed in an informal sense.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2495">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In no way are we talking about infringing on the rights of athletes in some way. That is not what this is about at all. In fact, it is very clearly set out in the legislative base. Going through the clauses, one finds that it talks about the techniques of sample taking; who does the testing; if there is a positive test, how that is reported; processes so that, if someone has an intellectual disability of some kind, whoever is the guardian or parent is given the results of those tests; and so on. All of that is captured in here so that the rights of athletes are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are doing is actually extending the ability of the Australian Sports Drug Agency to do what it does best: that is, ensure that people in all forms of sport in this country&mdash;from the highest competitive level to the most basic level&mdash;compete equally against each other, so that whoever wins the gold does so on the basis of natural ability and natural talent. That is something that we should all be delighted about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have mentioned, I have had involvement with ASDA. On a number of occasions they came to check out, at random, clubs that are participating in the Australian Rugby League competition. Of course, my club&mdash;the Illawarra Steelers, of which I am still a director&mdash;is occasionally subjected to those testing procedures, and we see the ASDA people down in the dressing sheds waiting for the appropriate people to test. That is extended not only to the Australian Rugby League but also to the AFL, the National Soccer League, the National Basketball League and the Uncle Toby's Professional Ironman and Ironwoman Super Series.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is important. As a parent, somebody who has kids involved in sport or somebody who is coaching a sporting team at home, what you want are role models who are going to be there as competitive athletes: people who are going to be out there striving, training hard and showing what it is like to be a competitive athlete without having to rely on banned substances to get across the line first. That is the sort of thing that we should be holding up to people, not the likes of failed pop stars who come back to Australia and say that they like taking drugs. That is not the sort of role model we are talking about. What we are talking about are Australian athletes&mdash;people like Sam Riley&mdash;who are out there and are clearly the sorts of role models that we want our children to emulate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of ASDA and its international initiatives, to again go to the brief provided by the Parliamentary Library, on page 3 there is a whole series of arrangements with foreign anti&hyphen;doping bodies which have been approved under the principal act. They are required to maintain lists of who they are actually working with, and they are listed here: the British Council Doping Control Unit, the Canadian Centre for Drug&hyphen;Free Sport, the New Zealand Sports Drug Agency and International Doping Tests Management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that we are also assisting China, at the present moment, in developing its anti&hyphen;doping policies and testing procedures. I think that is quite appropriate. In fact, sport can be a very useful tool in assisting with the democratisation of countries where, perhaps, there are some concerns. I am not specifically talking about China in this case. Basically, if people in a sporting community understand&mdash;through coming to international meets and so on&mdash;the aspirations of other athletes and the types of environments in which other athletes participate, and see the freedoms that are involved, that can assist with political democratisation in their countries in a broader sense. I think that is quite an appropriate thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that we in Australia have been able to assist so widely in developing drug testing programs, signing memoranda with a whole range of governments around the world to assist in that and entering into intergovernmental agreements is a great tribute to this country, to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2496"> past government and, certainly, to the present government that has taken these initiatives in bringing this legislation forward now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to go into all the provisions that are contained in this because they have been adequately covered by the minister in his second reading speech. I would simply say, though, that we have to be ever vigilant. I say that because very recently&mdash;and I am not sure if honourable members saw this&mdash;a survey was done again of Australia's leading athletes and questions were put to them about drug usage. The one of greatest concern to me was that a very high proportion of Australia's leading athletes indicated that they had actually thought about using performance enhancing drugs. They had given it some thought because, like all athletes, like anybody in any business, if you are striving to be number one in what you want to do, clearly you make sacrifices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether you are talking about elite athletes or whether you get down to the kids running around in the park or the kids running around in my Collegians under&hyphen;14 rugby league team, they are striving to the best of their ability. But they get to a point where they suddenly say, `I really want to win this. Is there something more I can do? Is it just swimming the hundreds of laps each week up and down the pool? Is it the sessions in the gymnasium? Is it running hundreds of kilometres? Is it pedalling hundreds of kilometres?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They ask if there is something more they might be able to do to compete against some of those competitors in other countries where you get a bit of a feeling, or pick up in dressing rooms around the world at international meets, that maybe they have done something additional, that maybe there is some new substance they have been able to take which is not able to be detected at this stage. Their performance is enhanced and therefore they get that little extra edge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the things that do concern us. And the fact that this survey pointed out that a number of Australia's athletes were of the view that maybe they could at least think about doing it is a bit of a worry. But the fact is that we have ASDA doing a fabulous job. There is a commitment amongst Australian sporting organisations in this country to stamp this practice out and we have commitments at all levels of government to provide the facilities, the best possible training venues and assistance to travel overseas, which I know the honourable minister for sport supports through the Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provided we have all those sorts of things, we are giving our athletes the chance. I think they recognise that this is the case. But I do just sound that warning that we have to be ever vigilant, because they put in those hours and efforts and if they think there may be something else they could do that would give them that ultimate reward, that gold medal in an Olympics or another championship somewhere, I think we have to be careful. The fact that, in this country, so few people do says something about Australian athletes. I can only commend them all. I can only echo the sentiments that most honourable members would express&mdash;that Australian athletes do it for themselves and for Australia. And I think that is quite appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not oppose in any way any aspect of this legislation. It is an amendment because it is necessary to take what the Australian Sports Drug Agency is doing a step further. It provides some certainty and it provides protection for athletes. What it also does, though, is to again give a clear indication, not only to Australia's athletes but to organisations right around the world, that we are deadly serious about the fight against drugs in sport. We will do what is necessary to ensure that our athletes are clean, that they are participating on their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2497"> natural ability and that what they want to seek is that ultimate reward, that gold medal, in whatever event they happen to be participating in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I thank the minister for the way in which he has brought this bill before the parliament. I think it is important that it be given, as with the previous bill in relation to the Sydney 2000 Games, a speedy passage through here, through the House of Representatives and, indeed, through the Senate. It can then become law and the Australian Sports Drug Agency can continue to do the very fine work that it has done since its inception.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to speak on this bill. I think it is an extraordinary chain of events when we look at the listing of this morning's program in the Main Committee and see that a bill on the Sydney 2000 Games is followed by the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill. It really highlights some of the difficult questions that will need to be faced between now and the 2000 Olympics. No doubt, the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta will raise many questions about performance enhancing drugs and whether they might have been used during those Olympics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental question about drug use these days is: what is a drug? I think this is where it is becoming a very technical area. The Australian Sports Drug Agency, as the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) explained to the Main Committee, is a very professional body. It has reached a very high standard in terms of its identification of drugs and in terms of the technical procedures that it uses, which are recognised worldwide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had some brief contact with the agency and I want to compliment it on its very fine work. I would like the minister, who is here, to pass on my comments to the agency. I believe Australia is leading the world in this. The agency has the intention of trying to keep our sports clean not only now but also into the future so that, as the member for Cunningham also said, the competition is fair. If only we could achieve that in trade; what a remarkable achievement that would be! We talk about level playing fields. One of the things we want to ensure in sport is that competition is always fair so that it is a true measure of a person's ability, and of a team's ability to compete at international level, and to be successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My first question was: what is a drug? My next question is: what is a performance enhancing drug? This can take many shapes and forms, depending on the sporting activity a person is involved in. I noted in a bit of background on this particular bill that the use of substances to enhance performance in sporting competition was reported as early as the third century BC, in the ancient Greek Olympics, with athletes using mushrooms or meat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of our drugs are derived from botanical material. For the future it could mean that parents could create a diet of certain foods for their children which may lead to superb performances in later life, and hopefully that might happen. There is always the spectre looming over international competition that perhaps the substance has been recently introduced and has not been inherent in a person's diet, from early childhood right through his or her lifetime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there have been some passing references in sporting journalism in recent times about the physique of various athletes. The question has been posed as to whether athletes' physiques are natural, whether they have been developed from early childhood right through their sporting life, or whether they have been developed through something that has been introduced into their bodies in recent times to enhance their performances at a particular event or a series of events.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2498">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really does open up a Pandora's box in many respects, not only for organisations like the Australian Sports Drug Agency but also for sporting organisations. The difficulty is for the controlling bodies of sport, whether it be at Olympic or international competitions, to know precisely what impact and effect some of these materials have on an athlete's performance. I suppose you could cite a lot of the particular sports where individual events are created, like cycling, power lifting, rowing, swimming, triathlons, weight&hyphen;lifting, athletics, et cetera, and you could probably identify substances that perhaps enhance individual performance and create a better performance at the top level. But then you look at some of the team sports like football, basketball, netball, water polo, volleyball and hockey: every sport requires a different level of skill and prowess and different characteristics in the person competing in that sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that random testing has been done with a number of sports to try perhaps to identify a substance that might enhance performance, but not all of the substances in fact do enhance performance. As the honourable member for Cunningham explained to the Main Committee, some of them may in fact be detrimental. I look back at the case he mentioned of Samantha Riley. I have been involved in swimming all of my life, both as a competitor and water polo player and also as an official both at state and national level, and I look at the unfortunate situation of Samantha Riley where innocently she took a tablet from her coach to alleviate a headache, then was found to have taken a substance that clearly she did not know was in there. Whether it improved her performance or not would be highly debatable. I think this is the dilemma that is posed not only for the Australian Sports Drug Agency but also for international and world sport, whether it be at Olympic level or at any other level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the difficulty and that is why the Australian Sports Drug Agency is to be commended for its international recognition. I know that ASDA is becoming very involved in the lead&hyphen;up to the 2000 Olympics and I wish it well in its preparations for that. As part of an agreement with the People's Republic of China, the Australian Sports Drug Agency is trying to assist China to develop its drug testing and sports drug agency as well. That is to be commended, because I am sure that China will be looking to the Atlanta Olympics and also to the Sydney Olympics as being a showcase for their athletes' skills and talents and I am sure that they would be wanting to comply with the requirements and to ensure that their athletes do have success at both of those Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted to hear that the opposition does not oppose this bill. It is an important bill, leading up to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and also to the Sydney 2000 Olympics, and I wish it a speedy passage through the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too am pleased to contribute to the debate on the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1996 and to echo the sentiments of previous speakers from both sides of the chamber. I think it is tremendous when we get bipartisan support for something that will keep Australia near the head of the world in keeping undesirable drugs out of sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the bill is to amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act to facilitate more effective cooperation between the ASDA and international sporting organisations, to increase the effectiveness of Australia's anti&hyphen;doping program and to set out clear procedures, rights and obligations to reduce challenges based on legal technicalities in relation to positive tests. I will return to that later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Particularly when we are to have the Sydney Games in the year 2000, we want to make sure that the games are the Olympic Games and not the `Synthetic Games'. Drugs in sport go back </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2499">
<PARA>not only many years but also many centuries. In the third century BC, in the ancient Greek Olympics, athletes were using mushrooms and meat in strange ways to try and enhance their performance. Milo of Croton, one of the great athletes of the past, was supposed to have used special herbs and magic potions, eaten raw meat and done all sorts of strange things to enhance his performance. He died of an early massive heart attack, I heard, and perhaps that was some precursor to what has been happening in recent years here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anti&hyphen;doping initiatives in the world did not really kick off until about 1960 when we had the Council of Europe&mdash;21 western European countries which passed a resolution against the use of doping substances in sport. Later, around 1965, with the increased use of drugs in Olympic Games, the IOC started to take a particular interest in the issue and adopted a resolution. Things have moved on from there. Drug testing was instituted for the first time at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico. Drug testing programs commenced in Australia in the early 1980s. The Australian Sports Drug Agency was established in 1990 and we now have a testing laboratory in Sydney which is IOC accredited and which will be the one, as I understand it, that will be doing the testing at the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000, only four years away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latest figures I have for 1994&hyphen;95 show that in this country we have conducted 3,108 tests, 99 per cent of which were clear. There were 34 positive tests, which made up about one per cent of all the tests, and there was a high prevalence of those positive tests in the sports in which performance is enhanced by drugs&mdash;athletics, rowing, weight&hyphen;lifting in particular, swimming, canoeing and the like. We hope that the number of positive drug test results can be reduced even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this country and around the world we need more out&hyphen;of&hyphen;competition testing, which is happening, so that we can build up baseline information about the levels of certain drugs&mdash;some of which, such as testosterone, naturally occur in the body&mdash;and so that we can pick up the cheats out of competition. I have been disappointed to see the breakdown in anti&hyphen;doping agreements between certain countries, such as the agreement between Australia and China whereby we were going to do a lot of such out&hyphen;of&hyphen;competition testing over there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at the Chinese figures, which have attracted most comment in recent times. If you take the top 25 in any particular swimming event in the world, China had only six listings in 1991 but, in the following year, that figure had increased fourfold to 24 listings. In the year following that, 1993, the figure had increased fourfold again, to 96 listings. That in itself was suspicious enough, but what was overwhelmingly circumstantial, as far as the evidence goes, was that out of those listings 95 of the 96 were female. China had only one male swimmer in the top 25 in any swimming event in the world, but they had 95 top female listings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Perth world championships in 1991, China won six medals and, at the next world championships at Rome in 1994, they won 24 medals. All their medal winners were female. In fact, they could not even get one male swimmer into a final. At the Asian Games in October 1994, China won all 15 gold medals in the female events. They were pouring testosterone derivatives, particularly the anabolic steroids, into their females and turning them into half&hyphen;males, if you like, and cleaning up the pool&mdash;which made it very unfair for everybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is sometimes overlooked in this is the undesirable side effects that flow from these drugs. We all hear about the liver damage and the diabetes problems later on. We do not hear so much about the potential infertility that may flow from the massive use of these drugs. In <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2500"> that sense, we are really talking about breaches of human rights. I would like to involve groups such as Amnesty International and have them outlaw these drugs in their annual reports as breaches of human rights. To pour these drugs into innocent girls is an absolute scandal, I believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, there are other side effects. For instance, at press conferences, we hear girls with deep, husky voices. We see physical side effects, such as excessive body hair, particularly facial hair; thickening and protrusion of the mandible, the lower jaw bone; and so on. I have dragged out a photo of Kristin Otto from the last Olympic Games she attended. The square jaw is quite prominent. She was probably a very attractive girl in her youth; hopefully she has reverted to being an attractive female. I think there is a case to tighten up the level of drug testing over and above the present IOC standards. At the moment, the testosterone to epitestosterone ratios are quite generous. Epitestosterone is the precursor of testosterone in the normal body; it goes around at about a one to one ratio. Occasionally you can have an abnormal level as high as three to one. The last IOC standards allowed levels as high as six to one. In other words, you take a low level of these drugs and get away with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Stasi files&mdash;the East German secret police files&mdash;have been released since the fall of the Berlin Wall and it is interesting to look at the history of the swimmers in those days. Every female in the East German team was on massive doses of these things. If you think six to one is high, some of them were coming in between nine to one and 12 to one. Kristin Otto, whose photo I held up, had a level of 17 to one. She probably had more testosterone in her than the Canberra Raiders and the Collingwood Australian Rules teams put together. That is a tragedy indeed. Not only was East Germany cheating in a similar manner to China in recent years but the damage they were doing to those girls' lives in later life with infertility and body changes is an absolute disgrace. The governments must have known this was going on and they should be condemned for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very serious situation, indeed, and it is getting more sophisticated and harder to pick up in many ways. Of concern are the flushing and masking agents that are used: the diuretics flush out and dilute the urine before tests are taken; the masking agents block the kidney from excreting testosterone. If athletes know a test is coming up in competition, they can take these flushing and masking drugs up to three days before and within 48 hours they can get their levels down under that six to one ratio. Quite frankly, I do not think that is good enough. I am a strong advocate of constant out&hyphen;of&hyphen;competition testing. I know this costs a fortune: many of these tests cost hundreds of dollars each. The high resolution spectrometer machine that has just been put in at Atlanta cost something like $860,000 and it is going to be about $800 or $900&mdash;I presume that is in US dollars&mdash;per test. It is very expensive and it is totally regrettable that we have got to waste money in this way. But if it has to be done to eliminate this, it has to be done and that is all there is to it. I do not think anyone would disagree with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at the banned substances, as opposed to the restricted substances. There is a list of five categories. There are stimulants, such as amphetamines and caffeine. There are narcotics, such as heroin and pethidine. The dextropropoxyphene, Digesic, that Samantha Riley took is contained in headache tablets. There are the anabolic agents&mdash;the steroids, the testosterone that I have been talking about, and the beta&hyphen;2 agonists. The diuretics are also banned. The peptides and glycoprotein hormones and the analogues of these are also prohibited. It is those that are causing particular concern.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2501">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to do a lot of work on these human growth hormones and substances like IGF&hyphen;1, which is a 70 amino acid insulin&hyphen;type chemical that can enhance strength and power by up to five to 15 per cent. If you are on it in massive doses, it can cost $5,000 to $7,000 a day. I am alarmed to hear that athletes are taking it, even in lower doses, which may run into only a couple of hundred dollars a day or less, trying to enhance their strength and power. It causes swelling of the cells in the body, including brain cells. Because it mimics insulin, and blood sugar levels can drop, people can pass into diabetic comas in certain circumstances. It can enlarge the heart and can eventually kill you. The more work we do to detect these sorts of substances, the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have moved a long way over the last decade or two. Back in Rome in 1987, when Ben Johnson won the 100 metres, it was strongly rumoured that he turned up positive. Nobody did much about it. The next year at the Olympics, when he turned up positive again, he was banned. Nowadays, hopefully, the modern detecting machines&mdash;such as those, as I have mentioned, that they have installed at Atlanta&mdash;will be able to pick up these sorts of drugs, even if they have been used months before. Hopefully, those reports are accurate. But there are other drugs&mdash;drugs that naturally flow in the body, like the human growth hormones&mdash;where our work is also in the very early stages. In fact, the cheats in some cases are moving ahead of us. A great deal of work is yet to be carried out on those sorts of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, in the time allowed to me, I want to mention that there are great difficulties on the chemistry and the biochemistry side in detecting these things, but we are also in the infancy stages of the legal aspects of what to do when these drugs are detected. It is a very complex area, and the legal precedents are still evolving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at some of the history in this country. Martin Vinnicombe, that magnificent cyclist of a few years ago, turned up his first positive test to stanozolol. He had a two&hyphen;year suspension by the Australian cycling authority. He subsequently admitted that he had taken that drug, a steroid derivative. To cut a long story short, he appealed, and it was eventually overturned. Even though the test performed by the Canadian Anti&hyphen;Doping Authority&mdash;I presume that was at the University of Quebec&mdash;conformed with Canadian law and even though it conformed at the time with international protocols, it did not conform with the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act. On a technicality, that was overturned. So, even though he had returned a positive result, which was subsequently admitted, within the meaning of the Australian act it could not be accepted. It was a technicality. It is these sorts of things that have to be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequent to that, there were Stephen Pate and Carey Hall. Following the 1991 world cycling championships, they also returned positives for anabolic steroids. Again, the Australian Professional Cycling Council, the APCC, put a two&hyphen;year professional ban on those two athletes. They appealed that ban using the Tutty rugby league case of earlier years. I think it was about 1971 when that came up. They said that this was an unreasonable restraint of trade. They could have lost up to $200,000 a year in income because they could not attend the world championships: cyclists have to compete in Australia to qualify for the world championships. It was taken to court where it was argued that the international counterpart, the Union of Cyclists Internationale, the UCI, had imposed a lesser ban on them than the cycling body in Australia had. They argued that, because the UCI had imposed a lesser penalty, they should also have a lesser penalty imposed upon them out here. Because the APCC did not have a lot of money to fight this case, it was eventually forced into an out&hyphen;of&hyphen;court settlement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2502">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also a very similar case to that in 1991 involving a fellow called Robertson. He also turned up positive to a steroid. Again, correctly, I believe, the Australian Professional Cycling Council put a two&hyphen;year ban on him competing in Australia. After a long, drawn out battle of appeals, our cycling body here, strapped for cash, could not afford the lawyers and, again, had to cave in. That was most unfortunate. I know we have budgetary restraints but it is a terrible position when our sporting bodies, doing the right thing, are forced into this sort of situation where they cannot fight this in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the minister will be addressing that particular aspect. We cannot place too high a priority on getting drugs out of sport in Australia, and in getting consistent protocols, procedures and links between Australia and other countries around the world. We need to have standardised and uniform drug testing procedures and penalties in as many countries around the world as we can. We need to do that through the proper international forum, such as the IOC, so that we can cut out all this nonsense of technicalities and appeals. The sooner that is done, the better. The sooner athletes can compete against each other on an equal footing, and not on an unequal chemical footing, the better it will be&mdash;not only because of athletes but also because of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the work that the minister has done on this bill. I compliment the opposition for supporting this bill in the manner that it has. I hope Australia can continue to move forward as a world leader in this particular area. We can hold our heads up high. We can lead the way and say to the rest of the world, and to those that may be dragging the chain a little&mdash;China, for instance&mdash;that this is something that we place a very high priority upon indeed.</PARA></SPEECH>

However, having now been tempted by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide, I say again that the decision was wrong.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is very important to the sporting integrity of Australia in the lead&hyphen;up to the Atlanta Games and, arguably more importantly for Australia, the Sydney Games. It is leadership legislation such as this which will define Australian sporting men and women as world leaders, not only fighting the fight against drugs in sport but also in standing up for honest and fair sporting competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will allow the Australian Sports Drug Agency to work more closely and cooperatively with the international sporting organisations to conduct drug tests both at major sporting events and at out&hyphen;of&hyphen;competition events on an annual basis. The objectives of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2503"> Australian Sports Drug Agency, as defined by this amendment bill, are clear. The amendment will allow the agency to more effectively and efficiently deter the use of drugs or doping methods in sport. This bill also acknowledges that it is important to encourage the development of programs to educate the sporting community about matters relating to drugs in sport. Education is vital if we are to eradicate this unfair practice on our sporting fields.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also allows ASDA to advocate the adoption of a consistent and effective national response to matters relating to drugs in sport. Policies aimed at eliminating drugs in sport will only be truly successful and effective if there is an international effort to eradicate this problem. This bill further enhances ASDA's objective of enabling it to coordinate the development of a consistent and effective national response to matters relating to drugs in sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill goes further and strengthens the functions of the agency. One such function which is enhanced is the agency's ability to develop and implement drug testing programs. We need a nationally coordinated response to maintain our high standard of action against drugs in sport. If we cannot get our own house in order then we have no right to judge other countries. It is precisely because Australia is so tough on drugs in sport that we have an international leadership role in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill outlines the agency's function as advocating the international development and implementation of consistent and effective anti&hyphen;doping programs, and encouraging Australian national, state and territory sporting organisations and professional sporting organisations to develop and implement comprehensive and consistent anti&hyphen;doping initiatives. This measure includes initiatives relating to the testing for the use of drugs and to education about matters relating to drugs in sport, as well as allowing the use of the services of the agency in accredited laboratories. As a result of this bill, the agency will also develop and implement initiatives that increase the skills and knowledge of people involved in sporting activities about matters relating to drugs in sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with allowing the agency to advocate and support research inside and outside Australia about drugs in sport, the bill will further allow the agency to implement anti&hyphen;doping arrangements. The bill encourages the establishment of the means for the carrying out, by departments and authorities of the states and territories, of initiatives relating to drugs in sport and of the means for cooperation with those departments and authorities, as well as non&hyphen;government sporting organisations, to implement such initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to remember that this legislation was not framed in isolation. Given the importance of having a truly national and international approach to drugs in sport, to have attempted to make legislation in this area without consultation and cooperation would have been unproductive, to say the least. The widespread consultation involved in this bill's framing included input from the Australian Olympic Committee, CAS&mdash;the national sporting organisation, the Australia and New Zealand Sports Law Association, and the Privacy Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation also reflects the privacy and human rights principles laid down in other Commonwealth legislation. In particular, only those people who need to have access to information will be informed. The government has been concerned to protect the rights of athletes, and has built into the legislation certain appeal rights to ensure that athletes are protected.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2504">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But being aware of the athletes' rights does not override the athletes' responsibility to compete fairly with their fellow athletes. This legislation will ensure that drug testing programs continue to deter athletes from using drugs, while at the same time ensuring that the rights of athletes who undergo testing will not be compromised. Furthermore, it is important to remember that this bill will reduce the likelihood of legal challenges which may result from an athlete returning a positive drug test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill should leave no doubt in the minds of all honourable members of the government's commitment, not only to the eradication of drugs in sport but also to the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Since its establishment, the agency has conducted more than 3,000 drug tests, and it is a testament to Australian athletes that 99 per cent of these tests were drug free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my time as the shadow sports minister I had a lot to do with ASDA. In those days I had, and I still have, considerable respect for their expertise and professionalism. I am sure that view is shared by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agency also plays a highly commendable role in ensuring that our athletes can compete in fairer international competitions. During the past 12 months, the number of out&hyphen;of&hyphen;competition drug tests conducted by international sports has increased, I understand, by almost 50 per cent. The agency has carried out the drug testing programs for the World Swimming Championships, the South&hyphen;East Asian Games, the World Weight&hyphen;lifting Championships and a host of other major international sporting events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also entered into anti&hyphen;doping agreements with other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, France, New Zealand and Norway, as an acknowledgment of the importance of having a unified international approach to drug testing. Such multilateral agreements will lead to the establishment of an international benchmark for testing programs, utilising an internationally recognised system of accreditation and certification. It is therefore appropriate that Australia was the first non&hyphen;European country to accede to the Council of Europe Anti&hyphen;Doping Convention, which aims to harmonise anti&hyphen;doping programs between countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Australian Sports Drug Agency is essentially about, at both national and international levels, is ensuring that all athletes are given a fair go when competing. It is regrettable that there are some countries which still have athletes using performance enhancing drugs. One such country which has come under international scrutiny is China. This scrutiny is totally justified. For example, after the Hiroshima Asian Games, 31 Chinese athletes tested positive to banned drugs. To be fair, not only did the Chinese government respond to this by increasing the frequency of out&hyphen;of&hyphen;competition tests, but last August China passed a law making it a criminal offence to supply banned drugs to athletes, with a penalty of a four&hyphen;year ban for athletes found guilty of taking these drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These new restrictions imposed by the Chinese government have started to have an effect. By the end of last year, Chinese officials had conducted nearly 2,100 tests, which is a 50 per cent increase on 1994. During that period, only 17 athletes tested positive, compared with 31 in 1994 and 23 in 1993. I believe it is appropriate that, if China is genuine in its commitment to ensure that its athletes are truly drug free in competition, China should call on ASDA to help achieve this aim. This is one of the reasons why a joint drug testing program was announced last December between Australia and China under which each country could conduct random tests on the other's athletes. This is a truly historic decision, meaning that for the first time Chinese athletes would be randomly tested outside of competition.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2505">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that such moves to crack down on sports cheats&mdash;and athletes who take enhancing drugs are cheats&mdash;are welcomed by the Australian public. It was therefore with some concern that I read recent media reports which stated that the testing of Chinese athletes which I referred to earlier has not happened. As far as I am aware, ASDA is yet to conduct tests on Chinese athletes. I am not too sure whether these notes are out of date or whether the tests have indeed started. I hope they have. It is encouraging to hear that the agency is on the verge of going to China, although this may well be too late for the Atlanta Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be remembered that almost every country, including China, has already chosen its team to compete in Atlanta. I would hate to think that an athlete who competed fairly could miss out on going to the Olympics&mdash;an honour that every professional athlete strives for&mdash;only to be replaced by an athlete who, it is later found, is taking performance enhancing drugs. Although welcoming ASDA's move into China, I fear that this will be too late for the Atlanta Olympics, as I said before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with interest that the head coach of the Australian swimming team, Don Talbot, has also recently expressed a personal view that he suspects drugs will be present at Atlanta, particularly in the Chinese women's team. I think it is a great tragedy not only for the competition but also for those who are competing. It is fair to say, however, that the great majority of athletes who are going to Atlanta have got there on their own merits, on their own abilities and, as such, should be congratulated. It is unfortunate, however, that there will be a minority amongst them who are too gutless to compete on equal terms, and instead have turned to drugs to help them along. It is unfortunate that such people will be unfairly performing against decent and honourable athletes. Hopefully, through the continued efforts of organisations such as ASDA, such athletes will be detected and dealt with accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time for a little bit of parochialism, and I am sure that honourable members will allow me to indulge in it briefly. Athletes whose honest efforts, I hope, are not jeopardised in the representation of our country by those who are cheating include a number from my electorate. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, there are no drug takers amongst my constituent athletes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With your leave, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is with pride that I tell the House about the number of athletes who have come from Ballarat, a small region with extraordinary representation. Murray Hocking and Peter Blackburn are in badminton. Steve Moneghetti, the Ballarat Bullet, is, as I am sure you are aware, a Ballarat boy. Shaun Crichton is in athletics. Alison Cook, Robyn Maher and Ray Borner are in basketball. Russell Mark is in trapshooting. Anthony Edwards and a recent addition to the Olympic team, Bronwyn Thompson, are in rowing, and Shane Kelly is in cycling. Although Shane comes from Ararat, I am sure I speak on behalf of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) when I congratulate Shane Kelly and include him in the broader Ballarat region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lots of terrific stories come out of membership of the Australian team. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ballarat Courier</EMPHASIS> reported recently that Bronwyn Thompson, who had just got into the Olympic team, rang her mother and said, `Mum, it's not my phone and I can't talk long. We have made it, Mum. Start packing your bags.' Speaking as a parent with young children, any thought of any of them competing in the Olympics is a long way off, but it must really be an extraordinary thing for parents of Olympic athletes to receive such phone calls about their sons or daughters being chosen to represent their country. I am sure it is matched only by the extraordinary pride of those young&mdash;or youngish&mdash;people themselves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2506">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Competing at Atlanta will be a thrill, but I am sure that an even bigger thrill for Australian athletes will be to compete at the Sydney Olympics. At least at those games, Australia as a nation&mdash;and, more importantly, as a sporting nation&mdash;will be on exhibition for the world to see. We owe it to all athletes to ensure that they are the pinnacle of the drug free games. I have no doubt that our hard line on drugs in sport was one of the reasons we were given the honour of hosting the games. These Olympics will also give us an opportunity to show off the effectiveness of our domestic anti&hyphen;doping programs and, in doing so, to advocate to the international sports community the need for similar efforts worldwide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to be part of a government which supports a comprehensive package of measures aimed at ensuring that the games are truly drug free, and I am sure that is a sentiment felt by all members of both sides of the House, and it is something we can take great pride in. Some of the measures that the government has implemented and will implement include a drug testing program that targets international athletes competing in training in Australia; the advocating of out&hyphen;of&hyphen;competition testing programs by international sports federations which target their top athletes on an annual basis; drug testing via programs by SOCOG at the 2000 Olympics and the test events leading up to the 2000 Games; maintenance of an internationally accredited drug testing laboratory in Australia; continuing research to ensure new doping practices can be detected; education programs throughout schools and sporting communities; anti&hyphen;doping agreements between Australia and other governments; and measures to reduce the prescribing and illicit supply of performance enhancing drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is encouraging to see that key organisations from the sport, health, education, law enforcement, government and non&hyphen;government sectors will be taking up these measures. Agencies such as ASDA will only be truly successful if they have the cooperation of the athletes. Looking at the results of surveys, it is encouraging to see that our elite athletes believe that ASDA's drug testing program is likely to deter elite athletes from using prohibited drugs in sport. Our elite athletes also believe there is a high degree of accord with all aspects of the ASDA testing program, including the existence of ASDA testing and the conduct of ASDA personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that 73 per cent of athletes from one of these surveys rated ASDA as being successful in balancing an individual's right to privacy with the need to maximise the deterrent effect of the drug testing program. The survey also found that the way ASDA works in the sporting community has received wide endorsement, with a majority of elite athletes believing ASDA consults successfully with the sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wide range of sources of information on drugs in sport used by elite athletes reflects a generally better informed and aware sporting environment. It should also be noted that 86 per cent of elite athletes believe that a national organisation independent of sport, such as ASDA, should be responsible for drug testing. The overall conclusion from the survey is that Australia's approach to the drugs in sport issue has been successful. It is legislation such as that before the House today which will ensure that this success continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we gear up for the Atlanta Olympics and especially the Sydney Olympics, it is legislation like this which provides an excellent blueprint for ensuring that Australian athletes can compete fairly against each other and their international competitors without threat of being unfairly challenged by those athletes who cheat on themselves and their country. I believe we can all be extremely proud of this nation's sporting history and I think we can be extremely proud of the fact that under ASDA we have taken the lead in the world in relation to drug free sport. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2507"> There surely could be nothing more abhorrent to an athlete who has trained for three or four years, whatever it might be, in preparation for the Olympics or other major international sporting competitions to know that there is someone in the field who has enhanced their performance by the use of drugs. I think that, both as a nation and as an international community, we need to ensure that those who are competing at this level, at the highest level, are doing so on equal terms&mdash;not necessarily in terms of ability but in relation to the non&hyphen;use of performance enhancing drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, may I say, on behalf of all members, I am sure,  that we wish our team at Atlanta the greatest of success. We are extremely proud of the fact that they have even reached the level where they can compete and I am sure we have all got our fingers crossed that they come back with a bag full of medals. But I do not think it is the medals necessarily that determine the outcome; it is the fact that a nation of Australia's size can compete at such an extraordinary level with nations whose populations are far larger and who it is fair to say, I suspect, put considerably more resources into sport than we as a nation do, and have done over a number of years. As I said before, we can be extremely proud of our team.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;This debate has raged over two sessions of the Main Committee. As outlined in my second reading speech, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1996 is designed to ensure that the Australian Sports Drug Agency can continue to undertake its responsibilities effectively and provide a leadership role in the international fight against the use of prohibited drugs in sport up to and beyond the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both as Minister for Sport and also as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the 2000 Games, I have a keen interest in the work of the agency. I would like to thank the participants in the debate, Mr Martin, the shadow minister, Mr Reid, Mr Cobb and Mr Ronaldson, for their contributions. All agreed that the work that has been done by ASDA has been exemplary in every regard. This bill, which clarifies a number of matters, enjoys the very strong support of the opposition and obviously the government. Indeed, the opposition, to its credit, started the work on the preparation of this bill prior to the election. It is absolutely essential that we position Australia in a very positive light in the world community, given that we are going to be hosting the 2000 Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Martin was concerned about the rights of athletes being protected. As one of the other speakers pointed out, there were extensive discussions with the Privacy Commissioner in the preparation of this legislation. Mr Reid was concerned to ensure that our assistance to China was able to be progressed, and indeed it is. He was particularly complimentary to ASDA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Cobb&mdash;who, interestingly, is a veterinary scientist by training&mdash;gave quite an extensive overview of drugs in sport and prohibited substances. He made a point, at the conclusion of his remarks, about appeals problems, ensuring that appeals can be heard expeditiously and so on. For the Atlanta Olympic Games there will be a court of arbitration. It will be able to hear matters within 24 hours and get results quickly to alleviate any problems that might emerge where there has been a positive response to drug testing or drug screening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Ronaldson, the final speaker, gave a summary of the bill. He is a former shadow minister for sport. He worked extensively in that area prior to his illness. Now he is obviously fully recovered; he gave a fairly robust account of himself in here. He also indicated that extensive consultation had taken place between the Australian Olympic Committee, the Confederation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2508"> of Australian Sport, the Privacy Commissioner and the Australia and New Zealand Sports Law Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He indicated his interest in the China issue and the difficulties that have been experienced in the past&mdash;we hope that they will be diminishing in the future&mdash;involving Chinese athletes and prohibited substances. I am hoping that the minister for sport from China will be participating in a visit program here in due course; we will be liaising closely with them. ASDA is already involved in discussions with the Chinese sporting federations on developing a drug testing regime for China. They have not started doing formal tests as yet, but that cannot be far away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In common with every other member of the House&mdash;and, I dare say, every senator&mdash;Mr Ronaldson will be taking great pride in the Olympic athletes as they emerge in their particular areas. But he, like all of us, concluded with the view that it is best to be congratulating everyone on having got into the team. We will have our largest Olympic team ever going to Atlanta. He, like all of us, wants that team to do particularly well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier in the week, I found out some information which was a little disturbing. I will take this opportunity, as it is the first I have had, to raise it. It was about an incident that took place on 17 February this year, involving a drug test that was undertaken here in Australia and had some repercussions that were very unfortunate for a particular individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a Russian hammer thrower&mdash;Olga Kasinkova&mdash;who was able to record a world record under the rules of the International Amateur Athletics Federation. When one sets and reports a world record, one is required to have a full screening test and drug analysis before that world record can be accepted. Under the arrangements that we have in this country for doing the tests, there is a memorandum of understanding between my agency, ASDA, and the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories, who operate the Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory, which is accredited by the International Olympic Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened on this occasion was that the drug test was taken in and a half&hyphen;screen test, rather than a full test, was done. By the time it was realised that the technical error had been made, the sample had been discarded. So we were unable to provide a full clearance under the rules of the International Amateur Athletics Federation, even though there was no positive testing at all, and this athlete's world record is not able to be recognised. Contact will be made with the Russian Athletic Federation and the athlete, apologising for the technical error. It gives an example of how careful we must be with our procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be having discussions with the minister responsible for AGAL, Mr Jull. This week we have instituted some administrative changes to ensure that this occurrence&mdash;which, I am advised, has never happened before&mdash;shall never happen again. We are making some changes which will involve the laboratory's entering into crosschecking of analytical reports with ASDA laboratory advice forms before despatching reports to ASDA and, subsequently, to the relevant international federations. Secondly, ASDA will do crosschecking of each laboratory report with the request made for specific samples, when in receipt of that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the laboratory will retain the specific samples, in a frozen form, for an indefinite period&mdash;until directed to discard them by ASDA. That would overcome problems such as the one which occurred on this occasion and which, I might say, was very regrettable to the athlete concerned. There will be a redesigning of the advice form, to better highlight the selected options, and there will be automation of the system through bar coding, to eliminate human error. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2509">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is all that I am able to do to correct that particular incident, but I do want to make the point in this debate, given that there is very strong bipartisan support for what we are doing here, that, even with the best of motives and the best of intentions, sometimes there can be errors. When we find those errors in this very important area we will move very swiftly to correct them. We do feel very much for the particular athlete involved that that world record will not be recorded in the normal way and we will make sure it does not happen again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not, in any way, affect Australia's capacity to, as we have done, lead the world in drug testing for the world junior athletics championships to be held here in August or ultimately to be involved heavily in the detailed drug analysis work that will need to take place during the Sydney 2000 Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thank you for the indulgence to let me cover that matter. I commend the bill to the Committee and hope that it will be passed back to the House of Representatives without amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 19 April 1995, the High Court handed down its decision in the matter of Ridgeway v. The Queen. By a majority of 6 to 1, the court decided that where law enforcement officials use a controlled operation during an investigation into narcotics trafficking and, as a result, commit an element of an offence with which a defendant is charged, a court should normally refuse to admit the evidence of that element against the defendant. Some members of the court&mdash;Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ, at page 58 of the report in 129 ALR&mdash;indicated that if law enforcement officers are to engage in unlawful conduct in the course of investigations, a legislative scheme authorising this conduct would need to be established. The bill that is now before the House responds to that judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members will recall that a bill to achieve the same purpose was introduced by the previous government; that bill lapsed when parliament was prorogued. The bill now before the House is based upon that previous bill but includes a number of significant improvements, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the bill has been amended to ensure that controlled operations are used only for the purpose of investigating major unlawful activity. The important, but sensitive, power to conduct such covert operations will not be used for the investigation of minor criminal conspiracies;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the accountability mechanisms will be significantly strengthened by incorporating the recommendations made last year by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in its report on the 1995 bill; and</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2510">
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a gap in the bill will be closed by protecting officers who are engaged in properly authorised controlled operations from the possibility of committing offences involving the importation, exportation or possession of narcotics contrary to the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990. This was a possibility that was overlooked in the bill that was introduced into the parliament last year by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill now before the House also incorporates an amendment which was made when the bill was before the Senate. That amendment inserted a proposed section 15U into the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed section 15U will require that a certified copy of the certificate authorising the conduct of a controlled operation shall be tendered in evidence in a prosecution for an offence against section 233B of the Customs Act&mdash;or an associated offence, such as conspiracy to import narcotics in contravention of that section&mdash;that depends upon evidence gathered by way of a controlled operation. This process will place the defence, and the court, on notice that such evidence will be led, and will enable the defence to prepare should it wish to test the process for authorising the controlled operation, and to contest the admissibility of that evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will occur, albeit only occasionally, that a certificate will contain sensitive information&mdash;for example, the name of a confidential informant&mdash;or information about a related but incomplete investigation. The contents of a certificate are specified in proposed section 15N. It was a deliberate decision by the government&mdash;and by the previous government in its bill last year&mdash;to require that the certificate contain a comprehensive statement of the relevant information. This is another aspect of the detailed accountability package which will surround the authorisation of a controlled operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those cases where a certificate does contain sensitive information which it would be unwise to disclose, it will be possible for the prosecution to seek to have that particular detail suppressed by making a claim of public interest immunity. This will ensure that, for example, other investigations are not compromised, or the safety of an informant is not endangered through sensitive information being disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also make one other comment about the extensive debate in the Senate. This relates to the lengthy consideration of the issue of possible judicial authorisation for a controlled operation. This debate was prompted by an amendment moved by the Australian Democrats that would have required authorisation for a controlled operation by an `eligible judge', being a judge of a federal court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue was considered exhaustively during the debate, with the result that the amendment was ultimately withdrawn by the Australian Democrats. Honourable members may be aware that when the House was considering the previous version of this bill in 1995, I suggested that consideration should be given to requiring judicial authorisation for a controlled operation. The then minister, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), opposed this proposal, speaking at length about the difficulties that this would involve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My remarks were made prior to the decision by the High Court in Grollo v Commissioner for the AFP delivered on 21 September 1995. Obiter remarks made in that judgment indicate that the conferral of certain non-judicial functions upon judicial officers may well be unconstitutional, as being incompatible with the essential separation of powers which underpins our constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the debate in the Senate, the government made available an advice by the Chief General Counsel of my department which indicates the dangers which may attend the conferral <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2511"> of such functions, particularly those that are related to the investigative process, upon judges. A further practical consideration is the recent reluctance by a growing number of Federal Court judges to issue warrants under powers given to them by the telecommunications interception legislation. I interpolate to say that I understand that 17 of the 44 Federal Court judges are respondents to proceedings in their own court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has now become apparent that it is impractical, and may be constitutionally invalid, to empower a Federal Court judge to issue a certificate for a controlled operation. In the government's view, the bill now before the House represents the best and most practical way of responding to the High Court's decision in Ridgeway. I interpolate again to say that a case was argued in the High Court on Friday of last week which may provide an answer to the question as to the constitutional validity of the conferring of executive functions upon judicial officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the changes to the bill introduced last year, which I have discussed, the general purpose and thrust of the bill now before the House remain the same. The bill will ensure that there is a legislative base for controlled operations by law enforcement agencies and that the officers participating in such operations are protected from criminal responsibility for conduct undertaken in the course of their duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also provide an avenue for the admission of evidence obtained from controlled operations prior to its commencement, provided the operation was conducted in conformity with established procedures. Most importantly, the bill will provide a framework of accountability and control which will ensure that I, as the responsible minister, the parliament and the community have the opportunity to scrutinise the usage of this power by law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people, both in the chamber and in the community, might ask: why should we sanction the police participating in criminal activity? I stress that parliament has already conferred upon law enforcement agencies the power to do certain things which, if done in the absence of that legislative authority, would be a criminal offence. The entry onto private property without the consent of the occupier is an offence of trespass; however, police may seek a warrant which will authorise such entry upon property. The detention of a person may amount to false imprisonment unless the detention is pursuant to a lawful arrest or other similar power. The bill presently before the House is in a similar vein to this type of legislation, which is in the best traditions of our system of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drug crime is peculiarly difficult to combat. Rarely are there complainants about this conduct. The importation of large quantities of drugs is a clandestine criminal activity involving complicity, or participants who will remain silent for fear of retribution. Organised crime does not tolerate complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, the struggle against this trade involves very difficult choices for us as legislators and for the community. We are all committed to the preservation of fundamental values such as equality, privacy, freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial and so on. Equally, however, there is the right of the individual to protection by the state. There is a powerful public interest in opposing the spread of illegal drug trafficking, and the official corruption that it can spawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Good law enforcement is a citizen's entitlement. It must be borne in mind that loss of confidence in law enforcement will lead governments to measures destructive of civil liberties. This is not such a bill. The choice before us is between a society prepared to accept balanced <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2512"> legislation to counter criminals, and a society poisoned by the conditions created by those criminals and their activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill lays down a full and open system of accountability. The bill requires that the responsible minister, that is myself, is kept informed of all applications for a certificate conferring authority to conduct a controlled operation. I am also to be informed of the outcome of a controlled operation at the conclusion of the operation. In turn, I am required to table a report in parliament providing details of the applications made under the provisions of the bill and the outcome of the operations authorised under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The procedure will not lead to `entrapment' of people. The bill will expressly provide that entrapment is not permissible. A controlled operation may be conducted only in circumstances where the targets of the operation are likely to import&mdash;or export&mdash;narcotics whether or not the operation takes place. The bill will ensure that it will not be permissible for officers to procure the commission of offences which otherwise would not have taken place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequence of a certificate being found to be invalid because the decision to issue was not properly made will be that evidence might be held to be inadmissible. That will be a matter for the court. However, it is not intended that the effect of this will be that a police officer who acted in good faith in reliance on the certificate would then be prosecuted. The situation would be different if a police officer dishonestly procured the issue of a certificate. The law as regards accepting or rejecting evidence obtained by improper methods will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, controlled operations may lead to the detection of criminals whose activities might otherwise never be discovered, let alone prosecuted. I should emphasise that controlled operations are an internationally accepted investigatory technique.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 14 February 1993, the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances came into force in Australia. That convention was implemented by legislation that commenced operation that same day. Article 11(1) of the convention provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 11&mdash;Controlled delivery</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. If permitted by the basic principles of their respective domestic legal systems, the parties shall take the necessary measures, within their possibilities, to allow for the appropriate use of controlled delivery at the international level, on the basis of agreements or arrangements mutually consented to, with a view to identifying persons involved in offences established in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, and to taking legal action against them.</PARA>
<PARA>This article indicates the recognition by the international community of the need to employ specialised investigative techniques, like the controlled operation, to deal with organised and sophisticated traffickers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia the report of the Commission of Inquiry into<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct&mdash;commonly known as the Fitzgerald report&mdash;also discussed the use of new techniques in combating organised crime. Commissioner Fitzgerald concluded that an effective response to organised crime is dependent upon recognition of four factors:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the social changes which crime causes and the fact that it diminishes the quality of life;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the fact that crime escalates if it is not controlled;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognition that there are vulnerabilities in the social order which expose it to exploitation; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the steps that are needed to control crime.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2513">
<PARA>In relation to the latter point, Commissioner Fitzgerald stated that consideration should be given to a wide range of measures which would equip law enforcement agencies with new powers, including permitting `the infiltration of criminal groups'. Commissioner Fitzgerald concluded that orthodox policing is quite unable to enforce the law. This bill will ensure that Commonwealth law enforcement agencies have available to them the controlled operation as a tool in the investigation of the trade in narcotics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to discuss briefly the key features of the bill. The central issue in the Ridgeway decision was the admissibility of evidence. The High Court held that because of the involvement of law enforcement agents in the importation of heroin, the evidence obtained thereby was fatally tainted and should be excluded from the trial of the principal conspirator. Honourable members may notice that the bill before them says nothing about the admissibility of evidence. How then, it might be asked, does the bill respond to the decision of the High Court?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basis for the decision by the majority of the High Court was that a trial judge has a discretion to exclude evidence on certain public policy grounds. The public policy ground in question, which then triggers the discretion to exclude evidence, arises where illegal police conduct is an essential ingredient of the charged offence. In such a case there will be `an extremely formidable case for exclusion' of the evidence by the trial judge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court accepted that the legislature could sanction the use of controlled operations and that such a legislative regime could exempt the officers from the requirements of the criminal law. The court went on to say that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the absence of such a legislative regime, the courts have no choice but to set their face firmly against grave criminality on the part of anyone, regardless of whether he or she be government officer or ordinary citizen.</PARA>
<PARA>The enactment of the bill now before the House will ensure that the actions of law enforcement officials engaged in a controlled operation will not incur criminal responsibility and, as a result, there will not be a trigger for the exclusion of evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be noted that the bill, whilst protecting the law enforcement officers from criminal responsibility, will still preserve the essential criminality or unlawfulness of the importation&mdash;or exportation&mdash;of the prohibited narcotics. This will ensure that the importation or exportation itself is not made lawful, thereby exonerating the targets of the operation who planned the conspiracy. It is important to describe the effect of the bill upon prosecutions that are current at the time the bill commences operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of investigations that are affected by the decision in Ridgeway. They all involve very significant participation in trafficking in narcotics, for example:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> conspiracy to import seven kilograms of cocaine&mdash;one individual;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> being knowingly concerned in the importation of 3.8 kilograms of cocaine&mdash;two individuals;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> being knowingly concerned in the importation of, and possession of, two kilograms of heroin&mdash;two individuals.</PARA>
<PARA>I am advised by the Australian Federal Police that controlled operations were employed in each of these matters. These operations were strictly regulated and rigorously controlled covert operations. In each case they were conducted in purported accordance with the terms of a ministerial agreement relating to such operations and the detailed requirements of Australian Federal Police guidelines on the conduct of controlled operations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2514">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ministerial agreement was entered into on 3 June 1987 between the then Special Minister of State&mdash;having responsibility for the Australian Federal Police&mdash;Senator the Hon. Michael Tate, and the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce&mdash;having responsibility for the Australian Customs Service&mdash;Senator the Hon. John Button. The agreement provided that a written request was to be made to the Australian Customs Service:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where certain persons, goods, ships or aircraft, suspected or known to be carrying or having an involvement in drugs, are required by the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authority to be exempted from detailed customs scrutiny and control and in cases where there is to be substitution of imported goods.</PARA>
<PARA>Once that agreement was obtained, the operation was conducted in accordance with detailed requirements of the Australian Federal Police guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These guidelines run to 50 paragraphs and closely regulate the considerations that should be adverted to when deciding whether a controlled operation should be conducted; the level at which operations must be approved; the procedures for a controlled delivery involving the substitution of the narcotic substance; further procedures for those operations where substitution is not feasible or possible; the requirements for analysis of the narcotic substance; and the making of payments to couriers and informants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These operations were conducted pursuant to these guidelines. The operations were closely monitored. Each of the accused alleged to have been detected as a result of these controlled operations is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence. But without the passage of this legislation those trials will have to be abandoned. I believe the community would not see that to be a just outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I believe that the community expects that law enforcement agencies will make every effort to catch the `Mr Bigs' of organised crime, not just apprehend couriers and the dealers on our street corners. Indeed, the community has a right to expect, to demand, that law enforcement agencies will act to protect them and their children, who are particularly vulnerable. This bill will satisfy that demand by providing a firm legislative basis for the use of controlled operations as a device in combating drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other aspects of the legislation are described in the explanatory memorandum relating to the bill. I commend the bill and present the explanatory memorandum to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Senate on Wednesday 29 May 1996, the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice, Senator Nick Bolkus, had this to say in relation to the Australian Labor Party's position on this bill:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objective of this legislation is one that we are very deeply committed to.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle, the objectives and much of the structure of this bill we want to see in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only question is which is the best way to go and what accountability mechanisms are appropriate and can be appropriately invoked for this.</PARA>
<PARA>It is fair to say that that has characterised the debate by all parties since this bill was first introduced when we were in government. Indeed, it was a bill that was strongly sponsored by the then Minister for Justice, the honourable Mr Duncan Kerr, the current member for Denison, and he will be speaking in the debate later and lending his full endorsement to the bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2515">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the initial introduction of the bill in the last parliament until now there have been a number of amendments. From my point of view&mdash;and it is acknowledged across the spectrum&mdash;those amendments are an improvement to what was originally put to the parliament and I applaud the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) for those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some of us on both sides of the House that still have some reservation about aspects of this bill. That needs to be looked at in context. I think the Attorney&hyphen;General was right when he said that there are different principles involved here. As law makers we really need in some instances to compromise; you cannot be pure one way or pure the other. There are practical difficulties and we need to acknowledge them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill certainly has had a lot of scrutiny. It will not satisfy some sections of the community; there will still be reservations about certain aspects. In that respect I would obviously counsel the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice to continue to monitor the operations of this bill because I fear, and I hope it does not come to pass, events will necessitate our revisiting this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am now presenting are personal reservations. I want to put them on the record, acknowledging that I will be supporting this bill, as will the opposition wholeheartedly. The time has come to pass it; I do not think that we are going to be able to satisfy everyone's concerns. Indeed, at one stage the Democrats in the Senate put in some amendments that related to the concept of external accountability and the Labor Party was prepared to support those amendments. When they were withdrawn we understood why they were withdrawn. It is a debate between people who are trying to achieve the same purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My reservations are encapsulated by some of the civil liberties groups. It goes back to the agreement provided on 3 June 1987 between the then Special Minister of State, Senator Michael Tate, and the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator John Button. The minister in his second reading speech cited that section of the agreement. I think it is worth revisiting. The agreement provided that a written request was to be made to the Australian Customs Service:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where certain persons, goods, ships or aircraft, suspected or known to be carrying or having an involvement in drugs, are required by the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authority to be exempted from detailed Customs scrutiny and control&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and here is the crunch part&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and in cases where there is to be substitution of imported goods.</PARA>
<PARA>So the original agreement really related to where goods were substituted, not the actual importation of illegal substances.What has happened as a result of the Ridgeway decision, I think it is fair to say, is that the authorities are receiving a bonus out of this legislation. That is where my concern is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a point where it is inappropriate for the authorities to be not monitoring and reacting, which is what I prefer. I do prefer a monitor, react and substitution situation, rather than allowing people within the authorities to engage in the importation as part of a controlled operation. It is just something I would caution, because the last thing I would like to see is authorities engaging in a controlled operation and not having substitution there, and those goods going astray. That is where the problem will arise: that if there is a controlled operation in the future and it involves a large amount&mdash;and I am not talking about entrapment here&mdash;the authorities leave themselves open. But I recognise that it is not a perfect world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2516">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reservation was police authorising police. That is where some people in the community took the view that we should adopt what is in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to allow judicial authorisation. I acknowledge what the Attorney has said, that members of the judiciary are not all that happy with that and that there is a case before the High Court to do with the Hindmarsh Island situation and involving Her Honour Justice Jane Matthews. So I think that will see a further evolution as to whether the obiter that is in Grollo's case is, in fact, going to be the pronouncement by the High Court or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is an evolving situation. In the end, no side is going to achieve totally what they want. There is a balance in this bill. I think the authorities can legitimately say, `If the politicians want us to successfully stop the big importers, then we need these sorts of powers. We need legislative endorsement.' Basically, that is what the High Court said: if they are to engage in them, they need legislative endorsement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is lending its support. This is really something that is not party political, it is not crossing political boundaries. It is people genuinely having different views. My background is one of a defender; I have never prosecuted in my life. I must say that I have a particular view, and it is based on personal experiences. Others, like my colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), have engaged in prosecutions; they have appeared on both sides of the fence. It is fair to say that he is probably more objective and balanced than myself when it comes to the criminal code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that I tend to err on the side of the accused in terms of keeping those mechanisms in place. I subscribe to the view that it is better that 99 guilty go free, than that one innocent person is convicted. What frightens me is that, in the climate we have at the moment where you do have commentators who are uninformed, we get some bad cases and what happens is that bad cases make bad law and we go to the lowest common denominator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying that about this legislation. The time has come for it to pass through the parliament. But I have put these reservations on the basis that what I would like to see&mdash;and I am sure it will happen anyway&mdash;is a monitoring of the situation. If the situation is out of control, it needs to be looked at. If it is a situation where the police forces themselves are vulnerable when these matters come into court because it is authorisation of police on police and so acquittals are occurring because of suspicions&mdash;and it is not hard to put that into the arena&mdash;then we might need to look at some other form of external authorisation. That is something that will only evolve with time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad the Attorney&hyphen;General has included in the legislation the amendment that ensures controlled operations are used only for the purpose of investigating major unlawful activity. I know the honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) will have something to say on this in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose it is really in the eyes of the beholder. My view of major unlawful activity is a little different from that of other people's. I would like this legislation to be used to catch those people who are higher up the chain rather than to pick up someone down the chain. In my view, if it is not substitution and not just a monitoring and reacting situation, this situation&mdash;which allows the authorities to engage in what would otherwise be illegal activities&mdash;should be used sparingly. It should be reserved for those in the community whom we believe are engaging in criminal behaviour and not for those at the lower end of the scale. This is something that only time will tell; I am not here to be a prophet of doom.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2517">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not speak on this in the last parliament. Because of some aspects of the bill at that time, I took the view that silence was golden. In my position, I felt this was the best thing I could do. I appreciate the fact that the Attorney-General played a role in the previous debate in the last parliament. I understand his role and I have every confidence in the role that he will play as Attorney&hyphen;General as far as this legislation is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To digress, I welcomed the appointment of Mr Williams as the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice. I do not think the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, could have made a better appointment for this particular office. I think his performance has been impeccable. I have one reservation, which I would like to put on the record, and it comes from someone with a legal background. I think the minister should be in cabinet. I come from that old school that says that the role of the Attorney&hyphen;General is not that of a normal minister. The Attorney&hyphen;General should be in cabinet; he should be giving proper legal advice to the cabinet. At times, this means that the Attorney&hyphen;General is unpopular. He is not meant to be a populist; he is there to provide proper advice. He is there to restrain the rednecks in parliament and in the community; he is not there to adopt the populist view. As far as the constitution of the cabinet is concerned, the quicker the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Justice gets into the cabinet, the better. I will leave it at that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the member for Banks (Mr Melham), I have defended on all but one occasion in 13 years of legal practice. I can assure you that I did not enjoy the one occasion on which I prosecuted. This bill comes&mdash;and I do not say this disrespectfully&mdash;from the prosecutorial side of things, so it is important to get the balance and the experience from the other side of the bar table. My particular experience involved a case that left an indelible mark on me and this has necessarily excited my interest in this particular bill. I seek leave to table the case. I do not want to mention it by name. I will refer to it as `M', if I may, Mr Deputy Speaker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SK6">Mr TONY SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to refer as quickly as I can to elements of that case and then relate it to the bill before the House. In that particular case, there was a major drug operation in Queensland. As a result of that major operation, to my knowledge only one person was netted, and that was M. The operation extended over many months. It cost the community hundreds of thousands of dollars and the result that was produced was less than satisfactory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the person M for whom I appeared, I can only say this. Having spent numerous hours with the person when I was in conference with her and so forth, I thought I had heard it all before until she came to give her evidence on the voir dire. Hearing her evidence in chief on the voir dire was enough to move me to tears, because it was an unbelievable story. The case extract does not fully illustrate it, but it illustrates it to a large extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that this is the sort of case that might be caught by the bill. In that particular case, the undercover police officer received an indemnity from the Attorney&hyphen;General. The indemnity said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that no prosecution or indictment will be brought or continued against R&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>R being the undercover police officer&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2518">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in respect of any act or omission reasonably and necessarily done or made by him in the execution of his duty as a police officer and in the course of the police operation codenamed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I will leave that out&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I do hereby indemnify him accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of background, the accused gave evidence on the voir dire. The voir dire is a trial within a trial. It is where the judge has to determine admissibility. This is important in the context of the bill. The defendant, or the accused, had to satisfy on the balance of probabilities that the evidence was unfair&mdash;in other words, that the evidence that was to be adduced against her was unfair, so therefore, she had to satisfy the judge on the balance of probabilities that it ought to be excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to bear that in mind. As I understand the law even now&mdash;and the law that will apply here&mdash;if the same situation arises, the onus on the voir dire will be with the defendant. It is all very well to say, `But ultimately, it is "beyond reasonable doubt"'. But if you cannot get past the voir dire, you go into the trial on the evidence. In the case of people who are caught in these nets, they frequently have a criminal history as long as your arm. Once they are raising unfairness and putting in issue the credit of the police officer, their history comes before the jury and they are gone. They are gone! The jury are not interested any more in the defence side of the case. That is the problem. It does concern me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This woman was 36 years of age at the time of this operation. She was introduced to marijuana when she was 13 and later to speed and acid. She was introduced to heroin when she went to university. She tried on numerous occasions to detoxify; she made a suicide attempt when she was 20. Her attempts to detoxify led to her being introduced to other drugs. She had an injury to her back, exacerbated by a car accident. The degree of pain was intolerable; this led her back to drugs. She had a sexual attack upon her where she was dropped on her head at Bondi. She suffered violently from pelvic problems&mdash;this was at the time of the trial. She had had a number of violent relationships with men. She had a history of prostitution, but she had, in her earlier days, excelled as a student. She had great potential but was held back. She had been involved with people who had died over the years from drugs and so forth, but she came to Queensland to get away from the drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the latter part of 1988, she had an accident in which she hit a little boy. The consequences of that were not very serious, but that led her to try to commit suicide again, because this is the way she was&mdash;constantly in depression. She took up with a friend who had also been in drugs, and this friend was then approached by the undercover police officer. There was no suggestion that she was dealing in drugs in any way, shape or form, other than that she used to smoke marijuana for pain. That is what she did. On a scale of one to 10, her pain level was somewhere about eight all the time. That was the medical evidence. So what do you do when you are a drug addict, or a former drug addict, and you have that sort of pain problem?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She was on methadone at the time, and she was going to university, trying to re&hyphen;establish her life. Then this individual came into her life. This individual, on the pretext that he was dying of cancer and was a small&hyphen;time dealer, fed his way into her life. She fell in love with him, and she would do anything that he said. So he inveigled her; he pressured her; he would constantly provide marijuana to her to smoke. Because the story seemed to hang together, it went on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the meantime, unbeknown to the undercover police officer&mdash;she did not know he was undercover, of course&mdash;she was seeing a psychologist and was saying quite the opposite: `He <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2519"> is trying to get me into drugs. He is trying to get me drugs. I do not want to, but I love him.' All of that evidence came out as part of it. It was a thoroughly dreadful case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His Honour made the following findings. She had been a heroin addict for many years in Sydney and moved to try to overcome it. She had serious medical, psychiatric and psychological problems, for which she had received treatment and counselling prior to 1989 and for which she was still receiving treatment. She had formed a close association with another drug addict, F, because it was difficult to find other social contacts with people who had not had a background similar to hers. She had used marijuana primarily to cope with her severe medical, psychiatric and psychological problems. She was strongly dependent on other people and prone to depression, with suicidal tendencies. She had taken a number of measures to deal with her problem. She had been a participant in the work of the alcohol and drug dependency unit and had resumed her university studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These matters were known, at least to a substantial degree, by the undercover police officer. He cultivated the friendship, His Honour found, through this other person and sought to promote the friendship through frequent social contacts. The emotional attachment started. Cannabis was used frequently on those contacts. So it goes on. But time is eluding me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of that, she was used to obtain a source of supply of cocaine in Sydney. One of most hideous aspects of all of this was that when this cocaine was brought back he gave her a cut of that cocaine. Was that necessary to the indemnity? I would say absolutely not, and I believe the man should have been charged with an offence, because it was not necessary to the indemnity to give her a cut. I further say&mdash;although His Honour did not find this&mdash;that I am absolutely satisfied that heroin was also supplied to her. So, by virtue of all of that evidence, His Honour found it was unfair, and he excluded all of the relevant evidence. So, ultimately, she walked from the court. I hope she has resumed her life to a large extent. The last time I heard, she had done that, after a lot of difficulty getting over all of this and the shock, too, of being told that this person she was in love with was actually a police officer who had been using her for nearly a year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am laying the foundation. In the bill, in section 15I(2)(b)&mdash;I know it is in a different context from 15M&mdash;the words used are `the person would not otherwise have had the intent to commit that offence or an offence of that kind.' The word `would' is used, and I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to bear that in mind. The words `the intent' I have a bit of a problem with too. Should it say `an intent'? I will leave that aside for a moment. The words are again used in subsection (5) of that same section&mdash;`would not otherwise have had the intent'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then come to this critical section, 15M, which relates to the certificate authorising a controlled operation. Part (b) of section 15M says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the person targeted by the operation is likely to commit an offence . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I caution those who have presented this bill, and I do so with the greatest respect to those on both sides of the House who have expressed views on this, about the use of those words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my submission that the word `would' is a far better word to use there. The reality is that the Mr Bigs are rarely, if ever, caught. We know that that is the intention. We know that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2520"> is what we are trying to do. But, frequently, as happened in this case, it is the person at the very bottom&mdash;the broken&hyphen;down, sad, tragic person&mdash;who is caught in this web, and that is my concern. That then goes to the issues on the voir dire, and the onus of proof and the problems there. It is all very well to say, `If you provide a test like that, the jump is too high'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we have to have something that can rectify that onus of proof problem. Indeed, it may be worthwhile considering whether the onus on the voir dire in a case such as this should be on the prosecution. That would go some way to alleviating the problem, again, on the balance of probabilities, as it always is. At the moment, it is on the defendant. Alternatively, we could look at the use of the word `would' in light of what, to me, seems a somewhat inconsistent use in the earlier section of the word `would'. I know that it is a separate area. It is a certificate in one area but, nonetheless, we seem to be departing slightly and we leave it open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think my time has run out but I do urge caution in relation to the matter. I have reservations. I believe the member for Banks has identified in broad terms that we have to monitor it carefully. But, bear in mind, as I said before, that people like M could be caught in the same situation. At the end of these operations, where hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent, we all know that someone has to be prosecuted, and frequently it is that person.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The 1989 National Health Survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) estimated the prevalence of diabetes in all ages to be 1.5%1. A more recent ABS survey of Australians aged 18 years and over, indicated the prevalence of diabetes at 3.8% for all adults2. The majority (90%) <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2522"> of Australians with diabetes suffer from non&hyphen;insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM or Type 2 diabetes). Diabetes is likely to affect 900,000 Australians by 2000 and 1.5 million Australians by 20103.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Nationally, the health care and other costs associated with diabetes were estimated to be $126.13 million in 1989&hyphen;90. When the additional estimated costs of diabetes&hyphen;related complications are taken into account, this figure almost doubles to $247.88 million4. These figures include public and private health care costs, such as hospital, general practitioners, medical specialists, pharmaceuticals and other supplies, and allied health care such as podiatry and dietetics, as well as indirect costs, such as foregone income, time off work and costs to carers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Although the Commonwealth does not provide direct funding to the States and Territories to combat diabetes, it funds a number of activities aimed at preventing the onset of diabetes and reducing the impact of complications. This includes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth Government subsidies in respect of insulin, testing strips and syringes which currently represent an average Government outlay in excess of $900 per annum for each person with diabetes who uses insulin;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding through Medicare for specialist and general practitioner services;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Approximately $5.25 million provided through the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for 77 researcher&hyphen;initiated research projects into diabetes and related issues in 1996;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Approximately $1.5 million for twenty projects funded through the Divisions of General Practice since May 1995. The projects aim to improve the management of diabetes through a range of activities including upskilling general practitioners, dietary clinics, access to shared care, and health promotion and education;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three rural health projects relating to diabetes have received funding of approximately $458,000 to provide diabetes management and education training for health care professionals and health workers in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has developed a comprehensive and strategic National Diabetes Action Plan as outlined in our policy document "Health Through <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> out Life". Implementation will take considerable coordinated effort.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer among Australian men, after lung cancer. In 1994, 2,590 Australian men died of prostate cancer and it is estimated that there were 2,810 deaths in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cancer in Australia 1989&hyphen;1990 (with projections to 1995)</EMPHASIS> , which was released in April 1996, estimates the lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer as 1 in 18.</PARA>

In 1990, the latest year for which national figures are available, 5,753 new cases of prostate cancer were reported. Where data are available for individual States, the reported incidence of prostate cancer has doubled over the last five years. The increase in reported incidence of prostate cancer is thought to be largely due to developments in prostate cancer detection methods in recent years, such as the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) In April 1995, the Australian Health Technology Advisory Committee (AHTAC) was requested by the then Minister for Human Services and Health to review the evidence on the benefits, risks and costs of prostate cancer screening.</PARA>

However, in order to produce a comprehensive review taking into account the latest available data, AHTAC required more time to complete its report. In producing its report, AHTAC has undertaken a comprehensive review of the scientific literature, current practice and the positions of medical professional bodies on prostate cancer screening; consulted widely inviting public submissions through the national press and by approaching interested organisations and individuals; examined social aspects and community attitudes; and incorporated the most recent available data on prostate cancer incidence and mortality in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Under the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 (the Act), insurers are not permitted to pay to their clients any amount of compensation that has been arrived at either by way of agreement between the parties or following a judgement of a court, until the Commonwealth has been refunded the Medicare and/or nursing home <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits that have been paid as a result of the compensation claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Notwithstanding the above, the insurer may be required to pay interest to the claimant where the time limits set by a court are exceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Act specifically excludes the Commonwealth from any liability for interest in circumstances where there is a delay in compensation payments being made. The reason being that the Act has been constructed in such a way that insurers can notify the Health Insurance Commission as soon as a claim has been made and can obtain a Notice of Charge before the case is finalised. Where a Notice of Charge is obtained before a judgment or settlement there need be no delay in the payment of compensation monies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) However, there have been delays, particularly in New South Wales, in the issuance of the final notices by the Health Insurance Commission, following the introduction of the scheme. This final notice (the Notice of Charge) is the clearance required by the insurer in order to be able to pay out to the claimant the balance of the compensation monies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Health Insurance Commission advises that the average time taken to issue a Notice of Charge varies from two weeks in Tasmania and Queensland to eight weeks in New South Wales. The HIC has a maximum of three months within which to issue the Notice of Charge following receipt by it of a Notice of Judgment or Settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The principal reason for the Health Insurance Commission's current inability to produce the Notice of Charge at much shorter time frames than those mentioned above is the much larger than anticipated volume of claims which were finalised soon after the commencement of the Act (1 February 1996) which the Health Insurance Commission has had to process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) To reduce its processing time, the Health Insurance Commission is putting staff on overtime and engaging additional (temporary) staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) On 21 May 1996, I met with the New South Wales Bar Association, the Insurance Council of Australia and the Law Society of New South Wales to discuss the delays. We have reached broad agreement as to how this can be corrected, with all parties acknowledging it is going to require legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) To that end, the Government is intending to introduce a Bill into Parliament later in the Winter sittings. We expect the level of cooperation that has been displayed by the lawyers and insurers so far in working towards a solution will mean that the Government can overcome the problems with the current Act to everyone's satisfaction. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2526">  </PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) My attention has not been drawn to the difficulties cystic fibrosis sufferers have been experiencing in gaining access to the drug Pulmozyme under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pulmozyme is available as a pharmaceutical benefit in accordance with guidelines developed by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee following discussions with the Australian Cystic Fibrosis Associations Federation and specialists in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The drug is supplied from the out&hyphen;patient departments of public hospitals after patients have been assessed at (or in association with) cystic fibrosis clinics. PBS subsidy commenced from 1 January this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not aware of complaints from the Federation or physicians that the current guidelines are no longer appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. For PBS subsidy the patient needs to demonstrate a 10% improvement in lung function (FEV1&mdash;forced expiratory volume in one second) after an initial trial of up to four weeks treatment at the recommended dose. This is because the clinical effectiveness of the drug is marginal and the cost high. The clinical evidence shows that the drug is most beneficial (and most cost effective) in the group of patients who achieve a response to initial treatment of at least 10% improvement in FEV1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommendation was based on clinical evidence submitted by the sponsor and a subsequent meeting with the Cystic Fibrosis Association and respiratory physicians.
