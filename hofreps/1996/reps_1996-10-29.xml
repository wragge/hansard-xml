<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Everybody could calm down just a little bit. I have seen this morning's press and I wanted to say a couple of things about the matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition. The first thing that I would like to say in response to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is that the articles written in the region's press have obviously been written in complete ignorance of what I and other representatives of the government have said over the past several weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that on 25 September, on the highest rating <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> current affairs program in Australia, I was asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All right. Is Australia in danger of being swamped by Asians?</PARA>
<PARA>I answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, I don't believe that. We have a non&hyphen;discriminatory immigration policy in this country. The level of that immigration in the composition of it between skilled and family reunion is always something&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I am perfectly happy to stand at the dispatch box all day and take questions on this issue, but I would hope that members on both sides of the House would treat it with the seriousness that the Leader of the Opposition claims it deserves. So we can have a noisy, rumbustious exchange over it or we can have calm, intelligent questions asked which are answered in an appropriate fashion. That is an admonition I would deliver to members on both sides of the House if they are interested in pursuing the national interest on the subject. On the other hand, if they want to make a lot of noise they can do so and be judged accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that I have already forcefully restated, on a number of occasions, the non-discriminatory character of Australia's immigration policy. I would remind the writers of newspaper articles in the region and I would remind any other entrants to this debate&mdash;from whatever side of politics or from whatever position they occupy in the Australian community&mdash;of something that I said on 8 October 1996 in this parliament in answer to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me take the opportunity of saying to the honourable gentleman that the Liberal and National parties will yield to nobody, no political force in this country, in our commitment to racial equality and racial tolerance. Let me make it very clear to the Leader of the Opposition that, no matter what arguments there may be about immigration policy in this country, once a person has come to this country that person is entitled to the respect that is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> due to every other Australian irrespective of that person's background.</PARA>
<PARA>On subsequent occasions, I have said that I find any demonstration of racial intolerance or racial discrimination as despicable and repugnant to the underlying values and beliefs of the Australian community. Those remarks have been made by me repeatedly over the years. They have been made before and since the events that appear, in the minds of the Leader of the Opposition and others, to have triggered the current debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never been reluctant to repudiate racism. I will never be reluctant to repudiate racism. I have said on earlier occasions&mdash;it is apparently past the recollection of some, including the writers of those articles&mdash;that Asian Australians have made an enormous contribution to Australia. I have repeatedly praised, and I will continue to praise, the contribution of Australians of Asian descent to the development of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that Australia is a tolerant nation. I do not take the black armband view of Australian history, which is so popular in some circles. I believe that the truth about Australia's past should be taught in an unvarnished fashion. I believe that the balance sheet of Australian history is overwhelmingly a positive one. I believe that the balance sheet of Australian history will demonstrate a group of people who have had great achievements, a group of people who have had heroic achievements and have done much to bring about a remarkably enlightened, tolerant and diverse Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me finally say to the Leader of the Opposition that I denounce the distortion and the ignorance of the remarks that I have made which are evident in the articles that have been written in the region. They are wrong. They misrepresent my position. They deliberately misrepresent my position. They could not have been written in full knowledge of what I have said because, as I have demonstrated clearly and frequently over recent weeks, I have denounced intolerance and I have supported a non&hyphen;discriminatory immigration policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say, though, in the context of that debate, that I strongly support the steps that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5976"> the government has taken to change the composition of Australia's immigration policy. I regret the fact that the Labor Party has given notice today of a motion in the Senate to stop the government changing Australia's immigration policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has given notice of a motion of disallowance. Those changes are not in any way based on race. I hope that, in the conduct of that debate, the Labor Party will not lapse into the falsehood of alleging that it is in any way related to matters of race or matters of discrimination. Can I say again, in conclusion, Mr Speaker&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LK6">Mr MAREK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is it a fact that all sections of the community have to play their part in keeping interest rates low so that mortgage burdens on home buyers and small businesses are eased? Prime Minister, given the fact that inflation is now low and government policies are in place to keep interest rates low, do you foresee anything on the horizon that might jeopardise this favourable climate?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5976" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, one of the reasons why the outlook for interest rates is very promising at the present time is that we have over recent times seen a very significant measure of wage restraint. That has made a contribution to the low levels of inflation. It is undoubtedly the case that wage increases linked to productivity and, through that, low inflation, is one of the prime reasons why we can hope that interest rates might fall further in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say to you, Mr Speaker, and to the House, that the obligation to display wage restraint, the obligation to ensure that wage increases are linked to productivity gains, is not an obligation that is confined to people on low and middle incomes. It is an obligation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5977"> that is also to be accepted and to be met in full by people on high incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that I would have the support of all members of this parliament when I say to the working men and women of Australia that we would understand if you felt that there were one law for you and one law for the rest of the community. That would be quite unacceptable, and I would simply say to all people who have wage setting responsibilities in the Australian community that it is essential that there be equality of sacrifice in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people will always accept reforms, the Australian people will always accept the need for change, if two conditions can be demonstrated. The first of those conditions is that the national benefit is explained and understood. There is a national benefit in wage increases based on productivity because they contribute to low inflation; low inflation contributes to faster economic growth through lower interest rates and greater investment activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second condition that people want to be satisfied about is that when restraint is urged, when sacrifice is asked for, all sections of the Australian community share that sacrifice&mdash;except the very vulnerable, of whom it is unreasonable to make the same demands that we make of other sections of the community. If you can satisfy the working men and women of Australia that it is fair across the board, that the sacrifice that they might be asked to make on occasions, the contribution they might be asked to make, is matched by the contribution of other sections of the community, they would accept it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons why the budget was so well received was that it was seen by the battlers&mdash;the working men and women of Australia&mdash;as being a strong budget but a fair budget&mdash;a `fair go budget', in the words of the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>. I simply say to them that we expect a fair go for them in relation to the fixing of the salaries of high income earners in this country.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe I have ever met anybody from DDB Needham. My adviser who has been handling the firearms education campaign was introduced to several of the representatives of DDB Needham at the question and answer session in Sydney and at the first pitch in Canberra. On those occasions I am advised they only exchanged small talk. They did not properly meet and did not discuss the campaign until a session was held with state and territory representatives in Canberra on 12 September, two days after they had been selected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also asked yesterday: on 29 August, why did staff at DDB Needham Adelaide advise government officials to ring the Attorney's office if they wanted to speak to the firm's principals, Toby Ralph and John King, to tell them why they had been short&hyphen;listed for the gun control advertising contract? I do not believe I have ever met Toby Ralph or John King. I have no idea why DDB Needham staff would have said such a thing. As I have indicated, there was no meeting in my office and no meeting was arranged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was asked: did my office subsequently provide officers of my department with a contact phone number for Mr Ralph and Mr King, namely, Canberra 273 2564? No&hyphen;one in my office gave that phone number to my department as a contact number for Mr Ralph or Mr King. To the best of my staff's recollection, no&hyphen;one in my office has at any time given that phone number to my department as a contact number for Mr Ralph or Mr King.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday I was not asked questions on the basis of `did you have a meeting'; I was asked questions on the basis of `what happened at that meeting'. I invite the Leader of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Opposition to get his facts straight before he makes assertions that involve sleazy innuendoes, before he tries to smear me or my staff.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Given the recent reduction in inflation, can the Treasurer advise the House of the implications for wages policy and the outcomes which should be expected by employers and employees?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5978" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Grey for his question. The inflationary pressures have been moderate over the course of this year, and the September quarter for 1996 underlying rate of an increase of 0.5 per cent met a 2.4 per cent underlying rate for the year to September 1996. That means inflation is now back to pre-Whitlam levels, and that it is no longer necessary in Australia to have wages chasing prices. Recently the national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Doug Cameron, said in relation to the claim in the metal industry:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want to maintain our members' standards of living and their buying power. That means we have to go out and chase wage increases. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5979"> </PARA>
<PARA>The whole point about low inflation is that you do not have to chase wage increases to chase prices. Prices are low. It is no longer necessary in enterprise agreements to factor in expectation of price increases in order to maintain buying power. In fact, it is now necessary to recognise low prices which means that there is no factor to be built in to maintain wage buying power, and wages should be settled on the basis of productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wage outcomes have to take this into account. In an economy exposed to international competition, wage rises that are unreasonable will lead to job losses. This is a point that was made recently by the outgoing chief executive of the MTIA, Bert Evans, who warned that in the metals industry&mdash;an industry which is subject to international competition&mdash;wage settlements, and particularly a wage claim of 15 per cent over two years, was defying gravity. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While they may well secure short-term gains for their members, in the longer term jobs will be lost, investment will be diverted offshore and Australian manufacturing industry will decline even further.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important in this climate to understand the importance of wages based on productivity rather than on expected price movements. Let me make it entirely clear&mdash;I think I have said that a few times in this House&mdash;that enterprise agreements where wages are based on productivity improvements will lead to real increases in remuneration. It is essential to get the productivity outcomes in relation to wage enterprise agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has also mentioned a point that was emphasised by me on a number of occasions in doorstops recently: when it comes to productivity based wage increases and enterprise agreements, that applies to executives as much as it applies to the blue&hyphen;collar work force. As far as the government is concerned, wage&hyphen;productivity outcomes based on restraint, locking in low inflation, are a two-way street. It is a question of not just the work force but management as well realising the potential that they have to lead by example in this area and to set the example in relation to wage outcomes and wage agreements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. He has been very actively involved in the process which has brought forward the package that we announced on the weekend, and I thank him for his efforts. There is a lot of commentary today on the proposed arrangements for the policy on workplace relations. One article in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>  that caught my eye was under the heading `New laws welcome'. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For graffiti cleaner company boss Rod Mackenzie and his employee Stephen Ford, the new workplace laws can't come soon enough.</PARA>
<PARA>Referring to the archaic nature of the existing system, Mr Mackenzie said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . his company, The Graffiti Eaters, would expand, but was hampered by lack of flexibility on working hours, individual contracts, and unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a pretty commonsense statement on the problems we had under Labor. Then Mr Ford, the employee, is reported as saying that he is looking forward to signing a contract. Why shouldn't he? This new change provides people with an opportunity for a job. It provides them with the opportunity to make some changes so that they can see their business prosper. As their business prospers, it gives them a chance for an additional dollar in their pocket. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>  picked up this theme in its editorial today. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . finally produced a commonsense outcome from . . . dealings with the Democrat Leader Cheryl Kernot.</PARA>
<PARA>In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> , the editorial starts off with these words:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement between the Howard government and the Australian Democrats on industrial reform legislation is a victory for political common sense and the art of negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It allows the Government to keep faith with the Australian people by overhauling the nation's outdated industrial relations system and is a positive use of the Democrats' numbers in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>But they then go on to say the following, which is an interesting reflection on the debate:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The big loser out of the Reith-Kernot marriage is the Labor Opposition which is left out in the cold, watching through the window, as the bride and groom are toasted.</PARA>
<PARA>I refrain from tabling some of the other material in the papers this morning, particularly the cartoons. The editorial goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labour market reform was the single biggest failing of the Hawke and Keating governments. Despite 13 years in office, the workplace saw precious little of the sweeping changes which affected other sectors. The prices and incomes accord which locked the union hierarchy and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5981"> former government into a pact to minimise strikes and stabilise industrial relations also snuffed out any hint of substantial reform.</PARA>
<PARA>I was not surprised, in a sense. Not only do we have these positive remarks, but even John Maitland of the CFMEU was able to say that he thought the outcome has been one which the trade union movement can live with. I find that a very interesting remark. Of course, time will test the accuracy of the statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that, in the face of the overwhelming community support for this sensible package which provides real benefits to Australian workers and in light of that very strong community reaction, the Labor Party&mdash;as we will find out today&mdash;are still proposing to move 351 amendments in the Senate. When we look at the amendments, we find that they are not just holding the policy position they had on 2 March, they are regressing back into the 1980s, back into the 1970s and back into the 1960s. They are opposed to award simplification; they are opposed to non-union agreements. Many of these amendments are not some constructive suggestions to improve the bill but in fact they seek to remove the provisions of the bill and to reinsert the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How out of touch can the opposition be with the demands of Australian workers&mdash;the workers of Lindsay and elsewhere&mdash;for a change which is fair to them and gives them a chance of a job and higher wages. You people are entirely out of sync; you are out of sync even with some of your mates in the trade union movement. Jennie George is quoted as saying that the ACTU now has different strategic imperatives these days compared with the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a final quote, let me refer again to John Maitland who said, `I think it is also a sign of the trade union movement looking for more independence from the Labor Party.' That will probably go down as the comedian's quote of the year. But it shows you how out of touch and how irrelevant are the opposition on this important debate.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

She said, `You need to understand that the history of the trade union movement is a history of a movement run by blokes for blokes.' That is true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the industrial relations system and the way it has evolved over time, you find that all the focus until recent times has been on awards as they relate to full&hyphen;time male adult employees. As we designed our reform package we were very mindful of that and were concerned to ensure that the industrial relations system was brought up to date and relevant for both men and women. We had constructive and extensive consultations with women's groups. We made a number of changes very early in the piece with respect to our package. When you now look at the entire package, from the point of view of its relevance to women, I do not think there is any doubt that it is relevant and provides a lot of benefits.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement provides for the retention of existing provisions which allow the commission to make orders to ensure equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value without discrimination based on sex. The allowable matters that can be included in awards have been made clearer and specifically include two issues of concern to women&mdash;namely, variations to working hours and notice periods and pay and conditions for outworkers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition of regular part&hyphen;time employment and the Industrial Relation Commission's powers to make provisions for such employment have been clarified. I think that this will promote and improve access to regular part&hyphen;time work with predictable hours and pro rata conditions. If you are trying to balance work and family responsibilities, whether you are male or female, the predictability of your hours is very important in order for you to attend to picking up the kids or whatever the responsibility might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will also be a number of tests relating to the agreement making processes which reflect good practice in agreement making. These tests will be useful where employers and employees seek to develop a culture of individual agreement making and will certainly assist women in the negotiation of enterprise agreements. In particular, employers will be required to explain the terms of proposed certified agreements to employees. In addition, the Employment Advocate will be required to pay particular regard to the needs of workers in a disadvantaged bargaining position. That would include women, employees from non-English speaking backgrounds, the young, apprentices, trainees and outworkers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will also be a requirement for a report on enterprise bargaining to be produced every two years. The report must cover the effect that bargaining will have on women, part&hyphen;time employees, casual employees and others, including young people. Overall, I think a fair analysis of the agreement shows that we are building on the extensive range of benefits for women already provided by the government's industrial relations reforms. Therefore, putting politics aside, those who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5983"> are concerned to ensure that we have a modern industrial relations system relevant to women as well as men should be pleased with the outcome announced on Sunday.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Calare for his question. He has been interested in this subject for some time and has spoken on it in the House on a number of occasions. The question goes to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and my relationship with the board, which has been the subject of some public discussion in recent times, as he would have noticed. Upon entering government in March of this year, I approached the members of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and pointed out to them that the coalition, when in opposition, had as part of its policy a requirement that members of this board have aviation experience to satisfy our requirement of having adequately experienced people on the board of this very important safety regulator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked those members of the board whether they would be prepared to consider stepping down from their position, in light of our well&hyphen;stated policy launched some time beforehand and which had wide industry support. Following that, I met with the chairman and members of the board. The chairman said to me that if I tried to sack them from the board he would take me to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and tie me up in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for longer than the term of his appointment as Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority&mdash;which he would be prepared to do.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason I have subsequently moved to ensure that we can, in part, satisfy our election campaign commitment to have appropriately qualified people on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, by seeking to expand the size of the existing board in order to bring appropriately qualified people onto this very important safety regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for members of this House to look at the appropriateness of the policy of the coalition, you need only look at the Justice Staunton review of the relationship between the old Civil Aviation Authority and Seaview Air. You will see why it is so important for that very important regulator to have people on the board who have relevant experience and qualifications relevant to administering that very important safety regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are moving&mdash;the bill is in the Senate at the present time and hopefully it will be passed soon&mdash;to expand the size of the board so that people who use our commercial air service around Australia can have confidence in the fact that they have a board which knows about the business of aviation and which knows about how best to achieve aviation safety. Unfortunately, of the four people appointed to the board, only one has aviation experience. For that reason, I and other members of the public&mdash;and, indeed, members of the industry&mdash;cannot have absolute confidence that we have the best qualified board to manage aviation safety regulation in Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the concerns. In answer to the member's question I would say that on coming to government we had a cost pressure with Medicare that amounted to a 5.9 per cent increase in costs real compound per annum. Recent OECD surveys suggest that if you want to get any handle on medical costs you have to look at the supply side because some 40 to 75 per cent of medical costs in Western countries are generated on the supply side of health, not on the demand side&mdash;something most casual commentators on health seem to overlook.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the supply side we have a dramatic oversupply of medical practitioners in Australia. If you look at general practice alone, we have some 4,500 oversupplied in capital cities&mdash;1,000 in Sydney and about 800 in Melbourne alone&mdash;balanced against an undersupply of only about 500 in rural communities. The danger of this was recognised by the former Labor Deputy Prime Minister, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Brian Howe, who said that uncontrolled entry in general practice and the increase in general practice numbers were a time bomb that had the potential to destroy Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the important components of this unrestrained increase in general practice was medical migration. It is hard to get an exact number of overseas trained doctors coming to Australia. It is probably around 600 per year in all categories, equivalent to half again of all the medical graduates we produce here in Australia. We find that New Zealand is starting to be used as a backdoor entry into Australia. Last year, 32 doctors from one country alone migrated to Australia using New Zealand as a staging post. The previous government had several attempts to do something about this. In 1992, a 25&hyphen;point penalty was put on the points test in the independent category. That stopped people coming in in the independent category and meant people came in as spouse nominees. Again, the exact number is difficult to define but in 1994 perhaps as many as 450 spouse nominees alone who were medically qualified came into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have decided to put an end to this. From 1 January next year we will be placing a 10&hyphen;year moratorium on overseas trained doctors accessing provider numbers and accessing general practice training programs. Overseas trained doctors will be able to sit the Australian Medical Council exam. They will be able to have their skills assessed. They will be able to choose to work in a salaried position&mdash;and there are 400 of them available in teaching hospitals around Australia; there are 50 of them available in the armed services alone&mdash;but they will not be able to access Medicare and go into open&hyphen;ended fee for service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Medical Council exam will be of the same standard as that of a final-year med. student, and we will be giving five years to have their skills assessed, not an open-ended time limit as it is now. We will give them two attempts to have their skills assessed, which is exactly the same for a final-year medical student. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be making a very small number of exemptions for two important groups. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5985"> first is for Australian citizens who have gone overseas to study medicine, principally at Cork, Galway and Dublin. The second is for spouses of people coming here who happen to be general practitioners and their partner is an eminent person. I do not wish to do anything to make it harder for well-qualified people to come to Australia. The simple fact of life is that doctors tend to marry other doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are taking a different approach to doctors who are already in Australia. We will not be reintroducing a quota on the Australian Medical Council exam for doctors who are in Australia before 1 January 1997. They will have five years to have their skills assessed. They, too, will have two attempts to pass. If they do pass, they will then have the right to compete freely and in a non-discriminatory way for training positions. If they do not pass, they will have the same options as an Australian medical student who fails final year twice: they can convince the university to take them on for further training, or they can choose another career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Included in this moratorium are two groups: one is New Zealanders, and the second is full fee paying overseas students. With respect to New Zealand, I have had three discussions with the New Zealand High Commission over the last 12 months, and I have spoken with the Secretary of the New Zealand Department of Health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be doing nothing to stop the free migration of New Zealand citizens. We will be doing nothing to stop New Zealand doctors taking a salaried position, taking a training position, or New Zealand specialists of a joint college coming into Australia. But we have no obligations to have unlimited access from New Zealand of people entering fee for service medicine. Under trans-Tasman mutual recognition, medical qualifications have been excluded. That was done late last year. It is essential to do this to stop New Zealand being used as a staging post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second group included in this moratorium are full fee paying overseas students. Currently, 11 per cent of Australian medical school students comprise full fee paying overseas students. If they marry and change <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their status, they will be entitled to graduate and to register. There will be a large number of positions available for them to earn a living, but they will not be able to access a Medicare provider number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To finish, I would say that this is a big change. Some people would say it is tough. In response to that, I would say this: we have been mugs to allow ourselves to be one of the last Western countries to allow unrestrained medical migration. It is killing Medicare. It is killing the cost of Medicare&mdash;it is one of the reasons it is going up 5.9 per cent compound a year. Quite frankly, it is simply not fair to Australian students, and it is not fair to those overseas trained doctors who have chosen to come and live here already. It should have been fixed years ago. It has been fixed today.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. The minister would be very much aware that many rural communities in my seat of Dawson, such as Glen Eden and Collinsville, find it very hard to obtain and keep doctors. Could he please reassure rural and remote Australians on this matter?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important point. I have to say that there is no other <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> single issue on which I get representation from honourable members than the difficulty of attracting doctors into rural communities. The fact is that rural communities have the right to have access to a medical practitioner, and, even though the undersupply might be small in total numbers, the impact on those communities is absolutely devastating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the honourable member that this is actually a worldwide phenomenon; it is not just something that we in Australia face. It is certainly faced by other large countries. It is faced by countries such as Indonesia, for example, which has difficulty getting its doctors to go to remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no easy solution because the lead times to do something are so incredibly long. The previous government had eight separate initiatives to try to get doctors into rural areas, and we have kept every one of them. We foreshadowed four new initiatives: university departments of rural health; medical school vacation scholarships; locum changes to make it easier for locums to get into rural areas; and, finally, funds whereby a local community could set up a trust fund to help one of their own go to medical school. In the budget we implemented all four of those. Subsequent to that, I have announced priority access to the general practice training scheme whereby someone can go to the country for a number of years and then get priority access. That will help country communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the honourable member's concern because many rural communities, particularly in Queensland and WA, rely on temporary resident doctors from overseas. There is nothing in our changes on medical migration that will make it harder for rural communities to get a temporary resident doctor if they can find one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the point I make is this: up until now there are many doctors who have been trained overseas who are resident in Australia or, in many cases, Australian citizens who have been prevented from having their skills properly assessed. They complain that they could be available to fill these jobs were they allowed to have their skills assessed, but they are being prevented from doing so by an arbitrary quota.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5987">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is incredibly unfair that Australian citizens may be prevented from filling these positions, and yet we bring in overseas trained doctors on a temporary resident basis to do it. So, by removing the quota that the previous government had of 200 places on the AMC exam, by allowing all overseas trained doctors who are currently in Australia to sit the exam on a non&hyphen;discriminatory basis, they will have the opportunity to fill those positions if they are up to a suitable standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I reassure the honourable member. I cannot promise that this will make a dramatic difference, but I can guarantee it will make it no worse whatsoever, and it will be fair for those people who are here and who are Australian citizens.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I made it abundantly clear what I was doing&mdash;I withdrew. But I want people to judge the opposition by what they say. They put up a disallowance motion which deals with some 144 regulations and they would have us believe that only four matters are being dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the proposed disallowance deals with a large number of issues which go to the integrity of the program and the ability of the government to deliver the program numbers. The opposition, on the one hand, would have us believe that the government ought to be able to deliver a program which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it has announced. It says in a statement from the Leader of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The immigration target set by the Howard Government for this year is 74,000. It is historically quite low but actually greater than the average of the past four years. This is not a major point of disagreement between the Government and the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>We have the shadow minister saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government must always retain the right to decide who does or does not enter this country on the basis of the rule of law.</PARA>
<PARA>And you have another statement of a similar character made in a speech in this House on the 8th in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So we have no significant argument about the numbers between us.</PARA>
<PARA>But they then seek to disallow the measures that will enable those numbers to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures they want to disallow are the measures dealing with: preferential family having to be sponsored by Australian citizens; immediate family of refugees or humanitarian entrants under that category not being able to come under that category any longer but having to be preferential family; allocating some points in the skilled family category for English language capacity; and `retrospectivity' in the changes that we have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what they do not tell you in their press release, which they hope you will find out if you happen to read and know the terms of individual regulations gazetted, is that they also intend to disallow the provision for a change in the balance of family test so that no longer will a majority of children be in Australia for sponsorship to proceed. They do not tell you that they want to disallow the provisions to recover full cost in English language charges in those areas where people have entered Australia through business migration or in the skilled areas and thereby impose a charge upon Australian taxpayers generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5990"> What they don't tell you is that they intend that nobody who gives an assurance of support should be required to honour that assurance of support if the money is paid in the form of a benefit in the mature age allowance. They will cover the other issues but, if somebody was able to obtain a mature age allow ance after arrival in Australia, where an assurance of support had been given, they want to disallow that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the most heinous one of all is the provision dealing with the people who want to lodge in Australia, while here illegally, an application form for migration offshore so that they can maintain their illegal status in Australia and pursue an offshore application. The impact of that will be that anybody who wants to migrate to Australia and who thinks that there may be an inability to process their application at a particular time&mdash;it might be in the independent category, where there is a four&hyphen;year wait because of decisions taken by the former government&mdash;would only have to get on a plane and come to Australia, have somebody lodge an application for them offshore to enter Australia in the independent category and then apply for a bridging visa here in Australia. It would be a ticket to illegality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would not only undermine the integrity of the program; it confirms the view that I have had over a long period of time about your management of the migration program of this country. You had no concern about the way in which the migration program could be manipulated and used by people who would not otherwise be entitled to come to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the way in which you were prepared to handle those issues at that time, when we saw a 33 per cent increase in the course of one year in the number of people coming to Australia because they were in a spouse relationship, when we saw a 74 per cent increase in the number of people sponsored for entry in the aged persons category, and when we saw a clear reduction in the way in which we were able to effectively manage the immigration program in Australia over a long period, the integrity of the program diminished very significantly. You are seeking to deny this government the capacity to deal with those issues in a sensible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point I made in the House once before: there is a capacity to cap and terminate every category of migration entry into Australia. If those measures have to be used to obtain the program numbers that we have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> announced and you have agreed with, it will be on your heads and not on ours.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Can the minister inform the House whether media reports about the Productivity Commission's report that the waterfront is a barrier to competition in the automotive industry are true? If true, how has this occurred?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5990" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question. Recently the Productivity Commission tabled its study entitled, `The automotive case study: <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5991"> micro&hyphen;economic reform survey of impacts on firms'. That quite extensive study, which took into account a lot of research work done by other government bodies, highlighted the fact that the lack of adequate reform on the Australian waterfront was a major barrier to the future of the Australian automotive manufacturing industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, it showed that the Bureau of Industry Economics had surveyed a large number of people in the automotive manufacturing industry and 80 per cent of those people claimed that waterfront reform had either stalled or was going backwards. The survey highlighted the fact that many people in the industry were dismayed at the millions and millions of dollars that had been thrown at the Australian waterfront, at Australia's wharfies&mdash;some $450 million being spent on topping up redundancy packages for Australia's retiring wharfies over the period of the government's waterfront program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The survey also highlighted the fact that people in the automotive industry were calling for further, more adequate and more effective reform of the Australian waterfront. They also pointed out that the inefficiencies and unreliability on the Australian waterfront were costing the automotive manufacturing industry in Australia a great deal in costs and in lack of reliability as a supplier of goods around the world. They highlighted the fact that the automotive manufacturing industry needs to have larger inventory stocks located around the world in order to ensure adequate and reliable supplies could be achieved. The study also highlighted the fact that the number of days lost due to industrial disputes during the period 1994&hyphen;95 had doubled over the period at the beginning of the early 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was concern by the automotive manufacturers about the high costs involved in using the Australian waterfront and also about the unreliability of the Australian waterfront. That is exemplified today by the fact that we have a dispute on the Australian waterfront because the Maritime Union of Australia is refusing to load a ship on the basis of political prisoners in another country&mdash;an issue that you might say is totally <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unrelated to anything going on here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission highlighted a number of things which needed to be done to overcome the inefficiencies on the Australian waterfront. They made three recommendations. The first of those was that the government's industrial relations reforms should be passed and enacted to enable industry to take up the fresh opportunities that those reforms, moved by this government, would offer both the waterfront industry and the automotive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission also recommended that secondary boycott provisions be reinstated in the Trade Practices Act. This, if you like, is the `protection of the innocent bystander' provision within our industrial relations reforms. The Productivity Commission also called for an increase in competition amongst stevedores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things have already been put in train by this coalition government. We are already moving to pass the legislation for industrial relations reform moved by my colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations. That is already under way. We are introducing secondary boycott provisions into the Trade Practices Act, as recommended by the Productivity Commission. Indeed, we are promoting increased competition on the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, we have set up a shipping reform group that is looking at reforms in the maritime sector. We have also seen the end of the illegal trans-Tasman accord, which has added 25 to 30 per cent to the cost of moving freight between Australian and New Zealand. All of these things have been done within the first seven months of the coalition government coming into office in March this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the 45,000 people who work in the automotive manufacturing industry in Australia recognise that waterfront reform is crucial to the viability of their industry, their jobs and their future prospects within that industry. It is this government that is acting, through industrial relations reforms and other reforms, to protect and boost the chances of those people maintaining their jobs. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5992">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission's report on the inefficiencies within the waterfront highlighted how important it is for the Labor Party to recognise that they have to put the interests of 45,000 people working in the automotive manufacturing industry ahead of the 4,000 aristocrats who work on the Australian waterfront&mdash;the aristocrats of the industrial relations system who enjoy pay levels two to three times that of those people who work in the automotive industry.</PARA>

We will make sure that they are project focused, not program focused. We will maximise industry ownership, and we will minimise the bureaucracy in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major focus for reform is industrial relations. It is an industry characterised by appalling industrial relations, by a lack of cooperation. We have had report after report saying that the producers, the processors and the workers&mdash;the people you say you represent&mdash;have all been losers as a result of your inactivity. We have had no action from Labor. For example, no-one in the world today&mdash;with the exception of people like Wally Curran and his mates opposite&mdash;would attempt to maintain the tally system, because it is holding us way behind our competitors&mdash;the Americans and the New Zealanders. Those opposite want to stick to it. They want to stay with the Wally Currans of this world, against the interests of the workers whom they say they represent. You cannot understand it, I know.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this morning's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , Mr Michael Seccombe, from the gallery, makes the claim in his column that I had said yesterday in answer to a question from the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) that a lot of money&mdash;both that given by the government and that given through organisations like World Vision&mdash;was wasted. The clear inference is that I was suggesting that giving money to World Vision was a waste. I did not say that, nor did I infer it. What I did say and infer was that I could understand the anger of people who gave money to great organisations like World Vision, seeing the political perfidy of regimes in different parts of the world which allows that aid to be literally wasted on the wharves, airports and railways.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I refer you to your answer given yesterday to a question which I asked you on 17 October regarding the conduct of a certain male member of the staff of the honourable member for Oxley. Mr Speaker, I thank you for your advice, which I have followed in the form of a letter to the member for Oxley sent yesterday afternoon. Mr Speaker, I seek further clarification and advice from you, as an article printed in today's Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  newspaper reports Mr John Pasquarelli, a staff member of the member for Oxley, as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are speaking for the minister today, are you? It is a bit embarrassing when we do not know who is going to reply on behalf of the government. The matter of public importance is this government's decision to abolish the Commonwealth dental health program&mdash;yet the Minister for Health and Family Services is not even in the chamber to pay the House of Representatives the courtesy of listening to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is probably years since we have had a minister squib on defending his decisions on a matter of public importance, especially a matter that involves a cabinet decision and a budget decision to cut $100 million out of dental programs for disadvantaged Australians. There is a good opportunity this afternoon for the government to try to explain to the people of Australia why they think there should be this cutback in dental services for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To understand the impact of this decision, you really have to go out and visit the dental clinics right round the country. To understand how callous this decision is, you have to meet the people in those dental clinics; you have to meet the people who now rely on Commonwealth funding through the dental health care program. These people rely on the Commonwealth funding so that they have access to emergency dental care. They rely on Commonwealth funding just to pay for the essential preventative dental care that every Australian should have as a right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you go to the dental clinics, in places like Springvale in Melbourne, you have a chance not just to meet the dedicated staff who are providing this service to low income Australians, but you also have a chance to speak to the people who live in pain every day because of the poor state of their dental health. These are people who are in pain when they chew their food; whose nutrition suffers because of the state of their teeth; who, due to the state of their teeth, are embarrassed to smile; who are afraid to go out or do not go out because they are embarrassed about the state of their teeth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5999">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the people who will be hardest hit by this minister's and this government's decision to abolish Commonwealth funding for dental health care. To personalise this issue, I would like to quote from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 1 October that spoke about a woman called Belinda Matthews. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Homeless in her 20s, Matthews says she neglected more than her teeth. By her 30s, her teeth were black, rotten stumps. "They were killing me," she says.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the past 10 months, she has managed to eat most foods&mdash;her gums were bonier than she expected. But she was unable to find work, with one interviewer suggesting she come back when she had teeth. "My face was all sunken in," she says. "I felt like a bag lady. I've had no confidence."</PARA>
<PARA>You can see from that quote that this cutback affects people who are in dire need of support from this parliament and this government. People like Belinda Matthews will be the ones who are hardest hit by this government's most callous decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today is the national day of action from people involved in providing dental health care right across the country. Today right across the country people are trying to persuade this government to change its mind. They are trying to persuade the government that people like Belinda Matthews continue to need the help and support of this parliament so that they have access to basic dental care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I can do no better than to quote from Michael Challen, the Executive Director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, who wrote a very pertinent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in Melbourne. Michael Challen says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Poverty and illness go together. While much of the answer to this inequity lies outside the health system, it is critical that people on low incomes are able to get adequate health care when they need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the great shames of Australia's generally very good health system has been the lack of access to dental health care for people on low incomes. The Commonwealth's dental health program was introduced to remedy this problem and has been very effective.</PARA>
<PARA>I can quote no better authority than Michael Challen when he describes what the Commonwealth funding did. I quote again:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Across Australia, 726,000 people had treatment.</PARA>
<PARA>And that was just in 1995-96. He further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, waiting times have been dramatically reduced&mdash;in Victoria from four years to 12 months. As a result, Australia's oral health has improved significantly, with 27 per cent fewer concession card holders having teeth  extracted, and 40 per cent more getting fillings.</PARA>
<PARA>Michael Challen, no-one who would be considered to be biased in favour of the Labor Party, a person who has a reputation for speaking out for disadvantaged Australians, sets it out in that article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  as to why it is important that this government changes its mind, that this government reconsiders its decision to abolish the Commonwealth funding for the dental health care program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the people involved in providing dental care in the dental clinics who are opposing this decision. Nor is it just the Labor Party which is calling for this decision to be reconsidered. It is not just Michael Challen, the Executive Director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence; it is people like the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson).</PARA>

In the town of Moree, up until two years ago it was difficult to even recruit a dentist to go to Moree. Moree was without a dentist for three years. It was only the Commonwealth rural incentive program that ensured there would be a full-time dentist in Moree. That dentist covered not only Moree but also Narrabri, Boggabilla and Toomelah&mdash;an area that caters for Aboriginal Australians who need access to that emergency and essential dental care.

<PARA>That is what this decision is all about. It is about making sure that those Australians who are in pain, those Australians who do need that emergency dental care, are able to get treatment in their local areas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth funding has meant that there have been large numbers of dental clinics built right across the country&mdash;in metropolitan areas, in regional areas and in rural areas. Some of these dental clinics will be constructed and there will be no staff to provide the service to people who live in these country towns. When you visit these dental clinics, you see it is inevitable that this decision will mean that there will be fewer dentists working in the clinics. This decision means fewer people who are living in pain, fewer people who are afraid to go out, fewer people who are embarrassed to smile will have access to that basic right to free dental care when they need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before this program came into effect, you were twice as likely to have teeth extracted if you were a low income earner and a health care cardholder.

You are not entitled to the chance to get a job. You are not entitled to have good nutrition by eating all the sorts of food you should.' This government, by this decision, is sentencing low income Australians by denying them the chance to have their teeth fixed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) may take some pleasure from the fact that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is not responding to this matter of public importance, he should be reminded that the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), for eight months, refused to directly engage the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop). Then again, I might understand that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that ought to be pointed out is: when will the member for Dobell, after eight months in this portfolio, be able to refer <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6002"> to something a little bit more authoritative than newspaper clippings?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth dental health program was established in 1993. It was announced in the dying stages of the 1993 election campaign by Brian Howe, the then Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services and Deputy Prime Minister, and by Paul Keating. It was announced on the run. It is interesting that the member for Dobell and the opposition should suddenly now find that there are poor people. I will speak about that later. It took them 10 years to create them and then in 1993 they found them and decided that they would provide some money for low income dental health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I became the President of the Australian Medical Association early in 1993, the then recently appointed Minister for Health, Graham Richardson, said, `Geez, mate, I don't know what I am going to do about this. I've been lumbered with $100 million with which I am supposed to put public patients into private hospitals and a dental health care plan that Howe's given me.' In fact, it was a $247 million commitment over four years and it was targeted at 1.5 million low income people to assist the states to provide easier access for people with low incomes for dental health services&mdash;to provide, if you like, catch-up funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was no prior consultation with the states&mdash;despite what the opposition may say&mdash;and the states had funded this kind of dental health care provision for low income people for 93 years. In fact, you could describe it as a form of cheap electioneering in the form of unilateral structural cost shifting&mdash;that is, from the states to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government of the day further cruelly raised the expectations of low income people in particular as it went about borrowing more money and selling more assets to fund what clearly was something the Commonwealth government could not afford. One consequence of this was that the states, in real terms, either froze or reduced their contribution, their responsibility, as the desperate then Prime Minister sought to buy his way back into government. Cruel stuff indeed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the member for Dobell goes to the Department of Finance <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Catalogue of Specific Purpose Payments </EMPHASIS>for 1995&hyphen;96, he might find documents like this far more relevant than newspaper clippings. Page 33 of that catalogue, in covering matching requirements of the states, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None. However, states and territories are required to maintain their recurrent adult dental funding levels as at February 1993, the announcement date of the Commonwealth dental health program.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth dental health program funding has assisted the state dental services to improve their service delivery over the last few years. The Commonwealth's initiatives with the states through the Council of Australian Governments to rationalise the overlap and the duplication in funding in administration will enable both tiers of government&mdash;that is, state and Commonwealth&mdash;to spend less money on desks and more money on beds and dental care. The Commonwealth is determined to work with the states to see that they uphold a responsibility they have had for almost a century to fund and deliver dental health services to low income Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an irony in the Labor Party raising an issue in relation to the poorer members of the community. I will begin by referring to Eslake's research. I am happy to send this on to the member for Dobell because he probably will not read it in the newspaper. Eslake found that, in 1970, 18 per cent of the population in Australia over the age of 15 were in receipt of some kind of social security benefit. By 1995, 30 per cent of the population of Australia over the age of 15 were in receipt of social security benefits. If you take the unemployed out of it, the figure is 24 per cent, almost a quarter of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the decade from 1983 to 1993, while Labor was in power federally, the richest 10 per cent of Australian income earners actually increased their wealth. By 1993 they were taking 25 per cent of the nation's total taxable income. The share going to the 10 per cent of the poorest Australians dropped to 2.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you then go to Hugh Mackay's excellent publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reinventing Australia</EMPHASIS>, he noted that by 1992&mdash;and keep in mind that is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6003"> after nine years of Labor government&mdash;the proportion of the population earning less than $22,000 a year had increased to 30 per cent. By then the top 30 per cent controlled 55 per cent of total household income. That is the top 30 per cent controlling over half of household income in Australia, while the bottom 10 per cent were getting less than 10 per cent of household disposable income. The middle class, defined by Mackay as having incomes between $22,000 and $72,000, had declined from two-thirds of the population in 1976 to less than 40 per cent in 1992&mdash;and less now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Professor Bob Gregory&mdash;described by the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) recently in this place as an eminent economist&mdash;and Boyd Hunter from the Australian National University examined the period from 1976 to 1991. They found that the average real household income of the poorest five per cent of suburbs had dropped 23 per cent, whilst the richest five per cent had increased their incomes by 23 per cent. The income gap in Australia has so widened that today one in six Australian children are growing up with no employed person in their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In April last year, the Economic Planning Advisory Council report on income distribution in Australia&mdash;consistent with this&mdash;also found that from 1978 to 1994 the top 10 per cent of income earners had gained a 23 per cent increase in real wages, while the bottom 10 per cent had dropped two per cent. In Gregory's view, there were two requirements to cure the developing tragedy. The first was to restore full employment. Unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, is the biggest cause of poverty and social ills. In his address the member for Dobell said that poverty and illness go together. I could not agree more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has done research in Australia and has found that unemployed men have a 17 per cent higher death rate, 57 per cent have higher blood pressure, and 53 per cent have higher smoking levels. They also have 50 per cent more visits to doctors a year and 35 per cent more admissions to hospital. If you relate that to longitudinal research done <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the United Kingdom, the wives of men who are unemployed have a 20 per cent higher death rate, and the suicide rate in children and teenagers is up to four times higher in those who come from families where there is unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give the member for Dobell and those in the opposition that are searching for the solution to relevancy deprivation syndrome the following quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My wife has known nothing but debt and poverty ever since we have been married. I know I ought to feel glad being able to spend so much time with my kids while they're young, but what can I give them? I just feel empty. I am ashamed that I can't provide them with everything they need. What kind of father is that? We have no life together even though we are never apart. If there is no hope for me, what chance will they have?</PARA>
<PARA>That is symptomatic of the kind of poverty that evolved in Australia's underclass over the 13 years of the previous Labor government. The hypocrisy of people who make the front bench of the opposition now&mdash;with their black suits, white crisp shirts and $200 ties that glow in the dark! We saw them wandering around in the seat of Lindsay furtively looking out the side of a white car wondering where all the battlers have gone. If they are wondering where relevancy is, just have a listen to what I am saying to you now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point that Bob Gregory made was that there was a need for an active policy at federal and state levels to prevent pockets of deprivation becoming entrenched in our cities. We need to avoid any potential for producing an underclass of people, many of them grouped in areas where it was exceptional to have a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important government initiative in this budget is in public housing. What we are trying to do is to provide the income support for low income renters in the public housing market so that they can live in areas where there are jobs and not go even further into an entrenched underclass created by the previous government, and in particular by the doyen of the Labor Left&mdash;the former health minister, Mr Brian Howe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the opposition want to talk about low income people and support for the poor, what about Brian Burdekin, the former Human <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6004"> Rights Commissioner&mdash;do they remember him? When he launched the result of his inquiry into the human rights of people with mental illness, he described people with mental illness as the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in the community who suffer widespread and systematic discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the response of the Labor Party at the time? Their health spokesman, Mr Brian Howe&mdash;again the doyen of the Labor Left&mdash;dismissed Brian Burdekin's report on the basis that he was a `passionate man'. Well, well! These are the people that come in here with crocodile tears for the poor and dental health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we look at the work of Professor Ian Ring looking at another group of disadvantaged Australians&mdash;the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Since 1976 there has been no improvement in any significant health indicator for Aboriginal people. There has been a 20 per cent increase in mortality and morbidity since 1983. If that is concern for low income people, then I am afraid I do not want any more of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to private health insurance. When the then Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, visited the Royal Adelaide Hospital during the 1993 federal election campaign, he said to the Australian people, `You don't need private health insurance. People are wasting their money having private health insurance.' This man was reported to be worth something like $5 million at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my pensioner patients, who was working as a volunteer cleaner in the office of a Labor minister of the day, said to me, `Dr Nelson, I go without food to pay for private health insurance.' There are a million families in this country earning less than $40,000 a year, half a million people on health care cards and 800,000 pensioners that were making, at the time, enormous sacrifices to care for themselves and their families. They were ignored by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot have it both ways. You cannot snuggle into bed at night with two to three per cent underlying growth, denying on the one hand taxation, communications and transport reform and then on the other say, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `We are going to have free education, free health care, free aged care and free dental care.' Those opposite presided over an ACTU&hyphen;government accord about which they made great things. Yet, in the first decade of that accord, the number of low income people that needed dental health care increased from 670,000 to 850,000 unemployed. This is at a time when we averaged 3&half; per cent annual growth each year. All you did with your accord was lock in the very things that prevent growth. You locked in a complex and inequitable taxation system, you locked in excessive government budget deficits and interest rates that the battlers in low income areas are now paying for and you stopped the fundamental things that created jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Symptomatic of the problems that the opposition, including the member for the Dobell, have these days is that when the March national accounts came in at 1.8 per cent, annualised to 4.8 per cent, one of those opposite said to me, `That is lucky, Brendan, you will not have to cut back so badly in the budget.' That is what is wrong. We have believed as a nation, driven by the dreadful leadership of the previous government, that we are a lucky country, that we can sell something each year, borrow more money and maintain an unsustainably high level of expectation of what government can provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Low income dental health care was provided for almost a century by the states. In order to buy your way back into government in 1993 you cruelly went further on the bankcard that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, gave us and borrowed more money to fund a low income dental health care plan. The objectives of that scheme have been met. Some 1.5 million people have been treated. The Commonwealth is working through the states to make sure that they pick up the ball where they dropped it and to see that low income dental health care is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that those on the other side ought to remember is that it is time in Australia that we stopped indulging ourselves at the expense of our children. I will speak on a bill later today and I will make more points <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6005"> along these lines, upsetting as you may find them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke with a couple of low income elderly pensioner ladies when I was in the electorate of Lindsay. I noticed the Labor candidate, Mr Free, furtively looking out of the window of a white car and dressed in a black suit, white shirt and a shiny tie. These two ladies said to me, `Dr Nelson, you can tell Mr Howard that we do not mind paying a bit more for pharmaceuticals and we do not mind paying something if we have to get care if it helps get the country out of the trouble that it is in.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those ladies voted Labor in March and they said to me, `We are going to vote for Jackie Kelly in this by-election.'

If they want to get dental insurance, it will cost them $182 a year. For a minister and for someone with unit trusts and $1,500 yachting jackets, that does not matter, but for a person who is on the pension, which is $173 a week, that matters a lot.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going to find now that the government has cut this program that the poor, the unemployed and the pensioners are going to have to go back to where they were before primary dental care&mdash;and we have heard the fraud from Bradfield talk to us a lot about how we ought to be helping people with primary health care; primary dental care has gone out the window from now on for the poor&mdash;with that group of people having 84 per cent more teeth extractions than people who have the money and can afford a dentist.

<TIME.STAMP>(4.21 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on this important matter. It is a shame that the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) chose to use most of his 10 minutes for a personal attack on the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) rather than using a factual basis for his arguments. For the record, the Commonwealth dental health program was introduced in 1993&hyphen;94 with the aim of improving access of health care cardholders to emergency and basic dental services. I would like to ask where the waiting lists originated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Bradfield has said, it was a program thought up on the run in the 1993 election campaign by a Paul Keating absolutely desperate to cling to power. It was a program which delivered some services in spite of the confused and hurried way it was put together when Labor unexpectedly won.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6008">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding totalling $278 million was announced in the August 1993 budget, and the states were subsequently advised that funding would be provided over four years&mdash;not forever or indefinitely, just a temporary measure for four years. I would like to know where the press releases are stating otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to the pretence of concern by the opposition, the previous Labor government had taken no decision on future funding for the program. The odds are that they, too, would have wound it up this financial year. Dental health care, I would like to remind those on the opposite side, is primarily the responsibility of the states. Those with health care cards will still receive public dental care as before, as will school children in school dental clinics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it absolutely amazing and astounding that the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) continues to single out the issue of widespread concern for the Commonwealth dental health program. How hypocritical of members from the other side to feign concern about budget decisions we have had to take in order to fix their mess of 13 years. Those on the other side simply ignore the widespread concern of all Australians about the disastrous effect of Labor's gross negligence and mismanagement of our economy for the last 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget $10 billion worth of debt, the highest unemployment level since the Depression and, for the last 13 years under Labor, health ministers who took decisions which put intolerable pressures on Medicare&mdash;no social justice, equality or access. Unless something was done&mdash;hard decisions made by our government&mdash;Medicare would have been brought to the brink of collapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Waiting lists under Labor had blown out, not only in the dental area but throughout the public health system. There had been an exodus under the previous government from private health insurance because of their own failed policies, further exacerbating the huge crisis in our public health system which had developed over the past 13 years&mdash;not in the past six or seven months since March but 13 years. The most vulnerable are our elderly and those on lower incomes with children who have been making huge sacrifices to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> maintain private health insurance because they had lost confidence in the Labor government to facilitate the basic needs of health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the lead-up to the election in March 1996, I doorknocked many houses as well as many retirement villages and nursing homes. From talking to many older residents in my electorate of Makin, I found that one of their major concerns was waiting lists in public hospitals. It has meant that many were anxious to have health insurance, even to the extent of not spending their money on food to pay their private health premiums. This was also happening to many young families with children in my electorate of Makin. What an indictment of the previous government's wilful neglect of not only the private health system but also those who are the most vulnerable members of our community&mdash;the frail, the elderly and the chronically ill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a sole parent, part-pensioner and low income earner, and having worked as a nurse in the areas of aged care and surgical nursing over the past 15 years, I can understand the many concerns of our chronically ill, frail and aged. These are some of Howard's battlers whom we will be genuinely looking after through our private health insurance incentive scheme. Once more, an incoming Liberal government has to clean up the mess of a Labor government, as happened in my home state of South Australia with its $8 billion State Bank debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This coalition government, particularly in relation to this issue, and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) have demonstrated courage and leadership in making difficult decisions in the long-term interests of all Australians, who recognise that this budget, although tough but fair, is the best and most well received budget handed down in 20 years.</PARA>

<PARA>I would like to make a few comments in regard to this matter. This motion is intended to grant a request conveyed to the House in two letters tabled by the Speaker yesterday. The letters are from Arthur Robinson &amp; Hedderwicks, solicitors, and seek permission <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the House to adduce in evidence certain extracts from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . The extracts concern debate on the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 1995. Arthur Robinson &amp; Hedderwicks act for the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd which is, we gather, seeking leave to intervene in two matters scheduled to be heard before the High Court. These are the proceedings listed in the notice of motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion does not address the substantive issue of the privilege itself. That is a matter governed by the law as expounded in section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. The well&hyphen;known immunity of parliamentary proceedings from being impeached or questioned in court is inherited from article 9 of the Bill of Rights. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> However, section 16(5) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act does in fact state that neither the 1997 act nor the Bill of Rights is taken to prevent the admission, et cetera of parliamentary records in connection with a matter arising under section 57 of the constitution or the interpretation of an act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there is some judicial authority for the view that the permission of the House is not required on the procedural question of the actual production of the parliamentary records as distinct from the substantive question of the use to which they can be put, the House has never formally abandoned the position that permission should be sought&mdash;hence today's motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of precedents for permission being granted. In fact, two instances have arisen in the present sittings, although in each case the request concerned committee records. Further background on these matters is contained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> at pages 690 and 698 for the information of members who would like to look that up. I am completely confident that, if it grants the request for leave, the House will be acting in full accord with the precedents which exist.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(4.37 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some further points about this very important issue on the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill. As I indicated last evening, our principal objection to this legislation is the fact that it refers specifically to funding being obtained through the part sale of Telstra. So all those clauses in the bill and those observations which refer to the sale of shares in Telstra are ones to which we object.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a very clear suspicion that this Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill and the linking of it with the part sale of Telstra were a ruse and that this course of action had been engaged in by the government during the election campaign as a sop to the environment movement but more importantly as a way of cynically engineering support for the part sale of Telstra which otherwise, I think the government recognised, was not palatable to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been given some currency by a recent report in what appears to be, and indeed I am told is, a reputable science notebook called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Science technology</EMPHASIS>, a monthly round&hyphen;up of science and technology in Australia. In it an article headed, `Natural Heritage Trust a fraud admits coalition senior adviser', goes into some detail about precisely how that fraud was engineered and perpetrated on the Australian people. That adds insult to injury, in my view. It is a bad idea, quite apart from these claims, but I want to put them on the record. The article says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Howard Government's proposed Natural Heritage Trust is a blatant and cynical political fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>That phrase, `blatant and cynical political fraud', is a quote from a senior government adviser. He says the policy, the coalition's claimed answer for rectifying Australia's enormous environmental problems, was, as he puts it, `invented overnight' as a means of attempting to soften potential public reaction against the planned sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra. That is something certainly that we believe to be the case, and it now appears that the government's ruse has been revealed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plan had been essentially devised&mdash;and, again, I quote the adviser&mdash;`as a purely political exercise' by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb, and had then been `imposed'&mdash;again using the adviser's words&mdash;on the former shadow minister for the environment, Senator Rod Kemp, and subsequently, he says, on the current Minister for the Environment, Senator Robert Hill. These are all claims made by the senior adviser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said that senior coalition MPs `openly joked behind closed doors' about the policy and admitted to the fact that it `couldn't possibly' in its current form or size make any serious impact on the nation's massive problems of land degradation, ailing rivers and loss of biodiversity. That is straight from one of the government's own current advisers. He said the extent of the deceit had `sickened him'&mdash;and those are his words&mdash;and a number of other coalition staffers who are genuinely concerned about the national environment for the sake of their children and the nation's long&hyphen;term future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This shows that the government was not genuinely concerned. They regarded it as a joke to be laughed about behind closed doors. An admission of major significance because it confirms what a lot of people thought&mdash;that this was a very strange link to make between a very important area of government policy, namely, the protection of the environment, and the sale of a public asset. It was always a lever to be used in the most cynical fashion. And now we have revelations that this was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6012"> contrived, basically, in the interests of the part sale of Telstra and not the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same article this journal was told by the adviser:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were appalled at the lies and deception involved with this issue. It's an exercise just based on one thing&mdash;finding a way to sell off Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The linkage to the environment is just a sop designed to cloud the Telstra sale issue and to try to blackmail other parties and the general community into accepting it.</PARA>
<PARA>The environment movement generally have been awake up to that. Without this confirmation, they were still very much aware of the fact that this government did not seriously commit itself to either the Natural Heritage Trust or its funding. The adviser goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anyone who looks at the figures can quickly see the Natural Heritage Trust is a blatant and cynical political fraud. There is simply no way the interests from the $1 billion supposed to be diverted from Telstra sale could possibly pay to rectify the enormous environmental problems confronting Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>And it goes on. I want to put this on the record because it is a very important confirmation of a serious problem: a cynical exploitation of the strong concern that Australians feel for the environment in an attempt to force the part sale of Telstra. An attempt that appears to have failed and the government now is left with no environment policy at all. It did not have any credibility to begin with and it certainly has none now.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to continue to point out that there was a very clear breach of undertaking by the government in relation to various programs which were supposed to be funded in the budget. During the election campaign, the government said very clearly&mdash;and it has subsequently repeated it&mdash;that it would maintain the environment budget at its current levels. Indeed, that was a very explicit promise made by the then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He promised that there would be no cuts to the environment budget and that all of the funds from the part sale of Telstra would be in addition to Labor's funding. The then shadow minister made much of a boast that, as a result of this, he would be able to double Labor's expenditure on the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the funds from the sale of Telstra, the coalition promised to spend $84 million on environment programs in the 1996-97 budget. Both of those promises were clearly breached, because there was in fact a 13 per cent cut in environmental spending and none of those extra dollars were applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result is that, even if the part sale of Telstra were to proceed, environment funding would be starting well behind. As I pointed out last evening, it would be likely that the broken promises&mdash;that is, the failure to maintain funding plus the failure to apply the additional funds that were promised&mdash;would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6014"> lead to $275.6 million in broken promises over the four years. When you look at the so-called extravagant, extensive funds to be made available from the sale of Telstra, you see that there has been a very significant breach of what the community was led to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just give a couple of examples of those 13 per cent cuts. The Australian Heritage Commission budget has been cut by 15 per cent, and most of that has been in cuts to community programs. The commission's national estate grants program has been cut from $5 million to $1 million. This, of course, will hit community based environment and heritage programs very hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ill behoves coalition members to come in here and talk about the new programs that might be funded under the Natural Heritage Trust when existing programs are being cut to ribbons. The reduction in funding means there will be a devastating effect on the identification and conservation of Australia's natural cultural and indigenous heritage&mdash;something which the ministers clearly do not care about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are all well aware of the very significant cuts that were made from government source funding to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the shortfall of $3.5 million to be made up from a big increase in the reef tax, from $1 to $6 a head&mdash;and we all know the impact that that is likely to have on the Queensland community and the tourism industry there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a very significant cut to the Environment Protection Agency. Again, from a government who claims to care about the quality of water and clean coasts and clean seas, that very significant cut means that the Commonwealth has very little capacity to monitor and improve the protection of our environment. There was a 21 per cent cut in last year's budget to the Environment Protection Agency. The cuts relate largely to the abolition of a $5 million paper recycling initiative&mdash;something which I would have thought was very sensible&mdash;to encourage the recycling of high grade waste paper. Funding for cleaner production was also cut. That again is something that is entirely against the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grain of what the government claims in relation to the Natural Heritage Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also very significant cuts to the Environment Strategies Directorate, which impact particularly on the directorate's capacity to manage Australia's world heritage areas. So it is not much good trotting out a whole new set of initiatives when existing ones of great importance are being cut so significantly. The budget cuts in that area include a $10 million cut in payments to the states for management of world heritage properties&mdash;a cut that is being matched by the states, because they say, `If the Commonwealth is withdrawing, so will we.' There is a cut of $2 million over two years to the mahogany glider Sugar Coast rescue package, and a cut of $5.3 million to the Queensland wet tropics planting scheme. Again, all of these things are alleged to be picked up by many of the initiatives in the so-called heritage trust, yet they are being cut from behind. So the net benefit of this funding, even if it were to be applied, is very small.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you compare what is to be applied with what Labor was spending and promised during the election campaign, the part sale of Telstra&mdash;$8 billion with $1 billion going to the environment&mdash;results in a net benefit over those expenditures of less than $50 million a year.</PARA>

<ELECTORATE> (Fremantle)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.04 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, our objection to this clause is that the crediting of amounts to the reserve refers to $1 billion to be derived from the partial privatisation of Telstra. There are a great many reasons to object to the part privatisation of Telstra from the point of view of community service and the fact that this should be community infrastructure. As a matter of principle I strongly object to the part privatisation of Telstra, and I believe a great many other Australians do too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated earlier, the really offensive element of this is the connection between the part privatisation of Telstra and a decent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6015"> environment fund. I do not think anyone in this community would object to additional funds being applied to the environment. Indeed, you would get the support of every member of this House and over 80 per cent of the community. It is very clear, no matter which poll is taken or when, that the community understands that a failure to address environmental problems leaves a very substantial legacy to future generations and that in some areas these problems are so great that failure to address them now will lead to considerable exacerbation so that additional funds will have to be provided in future. Dry land salinity in my own state is a good example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowhere in the past have we seen governments prepared to link the sale of an asset in this way with decent funding for an important government priority. In every opinion poll that has been taken pre or post elections, the environment is one of those issues that comes up near the top. Something like 80 per cent of Australians will give you a `yes' to the importance of the environment and, in particular, to things like clean air and water, anti&hyphen;pollution measures, protection of our forests, biodiversity and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just recently the minister was keen to trumpet that roughly 80 per cent of Australians&mdash;I have not got the exact figure&mdash;were supportive of the protection of wilderness areas. So you do not need to convince the Australian community that the environment is important. But to use that concern in the way that it has been used by the government to justify the sale of Telstra is cynical and abusive in the extreme, because it takes a deeply held conviction and tries to use it for a very tawdry political purpose. In this case, to say to them, `You can't have a decent environment program; we will not provide additional funds for these very serious problems that you care about unless you agree to something that you really don't like, that you object to for another set of reasons.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said in this place before that I think it is unconscionable that you tie policy areas together in this way. It really is equivalent to saying to people, `If you want a decent education for your children or if you want <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> access to decent health and aged care services, you can only have that if, for instance, you agree to the sale of Australia Post.' Apart from anything else, after a while you run out of assets to sell off in order to provide for the ongoing costs of government. That is a further reason for objecting to this legislation, in that it purports to be about capital expenditure but a lot of what these funds will go towards are problems that will go on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the minister said it himself last night in addressing this bill. He said very clearly that these problems were not going to go away in the short term. The nature of a capital investment is frequently that it is one&hyphen;off and it is genuinely capital. The nature of recurrent expenditure is that it is addressing a continuing problem which requires funds to be appropriated every year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply say to the government that the sale of Telstra is no way at all in which to solve this problem. Their deception on this issue has been exposed by one of their own advisers. As I indicated earlier, it is quite clear that this was a purely political exercise&mdash;as that adviser said, dreamt up by Andrew Robb and imposed on the ministers responsible for the environment both before and after the election. It has been seen&mdash;again, as that adviser said&mdash;as a joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, it is a very sick joke that has been perpetrated on the Australian people. It is likely now that the Senate will give the thumbs down to the part sale of Telstra, and for the very good reason, as identified by the Senate committee that looked into the heritage legislation, that it will leave the government with no decent funding for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only will there be no funds from the part sale of Telstra but also there already has been a 13 per cent cut to environment funding. Programs are going downhill very quickly. There was a range of initiatives which the government might have put in place in good faith and which would have had bipartisan support&mdash;and, indeed, did during the election campaign. We had committed ourselves to very similar programs but they were to be funded out of consolidated revenue and would have been part of the ongoing commitment of government, not some clever political trick.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Clause 44, page 25, lines 2 and 3, omit the definition of "Telstra".</PARA>
<PARA>Again, it is important to underline the fact that we regard the link between the part sale of Telstra and the environment as something that should be repudiated by every reasonable Australian&mdash;and I think it has been. All of the environment groups with which I have met&mdash;initially, with the exception of the Surfriders Association, which perhaps has a broader agenda&mdash;were very cynical about this particular link and, as time has gone on, have become more so. When Surfriders saw that funds that might have been provided out of consolidated revenue for the clean seas initiative were part of the budget cuts, they too saw through the government's strategy. I do not think that there is now a single voice in the environment movement standing up behind this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting with a number of representatives of the World Wildlife Fund and the New South Wales Farmers Federation who put forward a very sensible initiative&mdash;one which we introduced in Western Australia&mdash;to enable the fencing off of private land to protect remnant vegetation. It is a very sensible suggestion that has worked extremely well in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sort of initiative that people can understand, get involved in, and see tangible results from. However, people will not get involved at the community level, involving considerable cost on their own part&mdash;be it the cost to a farmer of labour to provide the fencing or the cost of volunteer labourers of getting involved in the Greening Australia program and the like&mdash;if they see a government which is disinterested, which regards the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environment as something to be used for political advantage alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that, like a great many Australians, I have watched with some interest a ploy, which seems to be working for the moment, of a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who is driven almost entirely by poll results. It is polling&mdash;which has been done, it would appear, almost on a daily basis by the Liberal Party headquarters&mdash;that drives the views of the Prime Minister and the ministers and their behaviour on a great many issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that we have not heard a lot recently about the sale of Telstra, the fact that it has dropped down the agenda in the Senate, is an indication not only that it is likely to go down there&mdash;at least, some pundits are suggesting that it will&mdash;but also that the government has realised that it is not exactly a winner. At least we can be thankful for that feedback from the community, that they are not happy with the government proceeding in that direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the ministers responsible will now reconsider what it is that they should be doing for the environment. The difficulty is that they have brought down this heroic budget which has cut a whole range of sensible programs. There will not be an opportunity, unless there is a mini&hyphen;budget, until next year to remedy the wrongs that have been inflicted on environmental funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment movement in Australia will not listen to this government for a very long time, nor will they cooperate on joint programs or be available to support the government in developing decent policy, because they are extremely cynical now about the government's intentions. Based on the government's record, I think that cynicism is justified. We need look only at the last few months to see that it is not just the cuts in the budget that would produce that cynicism but also a range of decisions that have gone entirely against the interests of decent environmental management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see the very significant extension of woodchipping of native forests. The government likes to see that as some sort of sensible industry policy but I have to say that it is not seen that way by a great many people of good <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6017"> standing and note in the community. It is not just the raving lunatics on the fringe who object to that policy; many solid thinking Australians see the despoliation of our forests that will occur as a result of that increase in the woodchip ceiling as something which the government should never have undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But not only are funds being removed; the protection of two of our world heritage areas is on the line at the moment also. The first is Kakadu, where we face the prospect of a uranium mine. The second is Hinchinbrook, where there is to be a huge tourism development right on the edge of the channel. Moreover, we now discover that the Hinchinbrook development has no controls over it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) had to admit in the Senate that he has no way of enforcing the agreement entered into with the developer about any aspect of that development. He came out and gave all these assurances that there would be controls and a management plan. It turns out that he cannot enforce any of it. He was embarrassed seriously in court yesterday when it turned out that there was no written agreement about, for instance, the cutting of mangroves for that development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment movement saw the linking of the environment to the sale of Telstra as first betrayal. They now have further evidence that this government is not committed to the environment at all.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Senate committee it was very clear that there was no real capacity for the Senate or the House of Representatives to really examine the expenditure of the Natural Heritage Trust in the way that they do with appropriations. Decisions by the ministers jointly could be made and only reported at a later date to the parliament rather than in anticipation. The benefit of having it on consolidated revenue is that members can look at it, judge it and vote on any application of funds before those funds are applied for the most part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way in which the Natural Heritage Trust will be operated will mean that members of the House will be unable to look at the expenditure until after it has occurred, which in many cases will be too late. We thought it was important to put a sunset clause in this bill to ensure that it came back to the House for proper examination before there was any further expenditure.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Preamble, page 2, lines 5&hyphen;7, omit "There is an opportunity for innovative funding arrangements that ensure long&hyphen;term certainty and that involve a transfer of investment in technological capital to an investment in natural capital.", substitute "There is a need for funding arrangements in respect of Australia's natural environment that ensure long&hyphen;term certainty.".</PARA>
<PARA>While most of the elements of the preamble are not objectionable and we do not object to them, there are some elements that we thought needed to be modified, particularly because of the definition of `natural capital'. It is not a definition that one finds anywhere else in the legislation or indeed in environment policy. It was something that was contrived for the purposes of getting the government off the hook regarding the proceeds of sales of public assets.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6018">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, they made it very clear that if they were going to sell a public asset it would be only to retire debt or to purchase another capital asset. What they have done in this case is nothing of the kind. While it might be said that some of these programs&mdash;for instance, the purchase of land for the purpose of inclusion in a national estate area&mdash;have the characteristic of capital, none of the others do. Most of them are clearly recurrent expenditure and have been so identified by successive Treasurers and successive governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Programs of a similar kind have not been included as capital expenditure in past budgets, nor should they be in this bill. The preamble compounds that error by referring to this transfer of investment in technological capital to an investment in national capital, as if that was what was happening. The transfer of investment in technological capital is one thing, but the so&hyphen;called natural capital is something else altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it important to say very clearly, as our amendment does, that there is a need for funding arrangements in respect of Australia's environment that ensure long&hyphen;term certainty. That is something that is conspicuously lacking from the government's programs. Therefore, we object to the way the preamble is currently construed and recommend the amendment to the House.</PARA>

<ELECTORATE> (Dobell)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.20 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill contains four measures, and we will be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposing three of them. The three measures in question all increase the price people have to pay for essential medicines. The first increases the cost to pensioners, the second increases the cost to families, and the third changes the indexation rounding rules for essential pharmaceuticals, and that has the effect of increasing the cost of these co&hyphen;payments in future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor opposition will oppose these measures because they represent broken promises on the part of the government, and the Labor opposition will oppose them because they are unfair. We will oppose them because we believe access to essential health services is a key responsibility of the national government. In one of his headland speeches to the Australian Council of Social Service in October last year entitled `Fair Australia', the then opposition leader and current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised `to maintain the real value of pensions and other social security benefits'. This legislation breaks that promise. This legislation shows that the Prime Minister could not be trusted last October.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister prides himself on having higher standards than the rest of us. An important test of the trust which many pensioners placed in him is this particular legislation. For every pensioner out there who decided to trust the Prime Minister's word, for every pensioner who decided to give the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister a go, their faith and their trust have been betrayed with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would like to turn to the first measure, which increases the cost of pharmaceuticals for pensioners. We think this is the worst measure, mainly because of that direct effect on pensioners. The Prime Minister in this legislation is forcing pensioners to pay $3.20 for each prescription, which is an increase of 50c for each script. For the first time this measure breaks the link between what pensioners have to pay and the compensation they receive through their pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until the election of this government, no pensioner was worse off because they needed medicines. When Labor introduced the co-payment for pharmaceuticals, we guaranteed that all pensioners would get more than <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6019"> enough in compensation. Those pensioners who needed 52 or more prescriptions a year did not lose a cent. If you did not need that many scripts a year, you were a little bit better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has changed all that. This government has destroyed the principle that pensioners should not have to eat into their limited resources for essential medicines. Now pensioners will have to dig into their pockets every time they need to go to the chemist. The dishonesty about this legislation and this measure is continued in the second reading speech of the absent Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that the `safety net' arrangements under the PBS are not changing, thus maintaining the high level of protection afforded under this scheme. The annual concessional limit to access the safety net will remain as 52 times the patient contribution at $166.40.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister tries to argue that `it is important to note that the safety net arrangements under the PBS are not changing'. It takes a twisted form of logic for the minister to argue that an increase in the safety net for pensioners from $140.40 to $166.40 is no change. That is obviously not true. Either the government has set out to deliberately mislead this House and the Australian people or this minister does not understand the impact of the measures that he has introduced into this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let me give an example. An age pensioner, perhaps living off nothing but the base pension, can reside in a nursing home and as a result pays 87.5 per cent of their pension for their accommodation. This leaves that nursing home resident living off the base pension with around $30 a week to pay for their toiletries, clothing, telephone calls, transport arrangements and pharmaceuticals. If these pensioners have to fill a prescription once a week or more&mdash;and tens of thousands of pensioners do&mdash;then because of this government's callous and dishonest changes they lose $26 a year, which represents almost one week's income for the pensioner residing in a nursing home living on the base pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, the Prime Minister's commitment to look after the least well off in our community was not a core commitment. It <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was one of these disposable commitments. This legislation will cost ordinary pensioners $323 million. It is not just the Labor Party that opposes these measures. I would like to quote from a few articles in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pensioners Voice</EMPHASIS>, probably one of the largest newspapers circulating amongst pensioners in my state. An editorial in the August 1996 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pensioners Voice</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed cuts to funding for community services such as Meals on Wheels and home nursing, as well as the proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme show a blatant disregard for older people.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Older people will not take these proposals and cuts without a fight.</PARA>
<PARA>In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pensioners Voice</EMPHASIS>  of September this year, an article under the headline `Federal Budget: Not really a Fair Go' said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The day after the budget was released the Daily Telegraph's headlines read: "A Fair Go", indicating that the budget had given Australians a fair deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this is the case, then all Australians must not include older people. Instead of giving older people "a fair go", this Budget seems to have targeted older people who are frail, sick and one of the most vulnerable groups in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in prescription charges will hurt the sickest older people and may mean some people, particularly renters, will find it difficult affording the medicines they need.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what a newspaper, the voice of pensioners, in my state says about these changes. It is quite clear that people who are living on the pension will pay that extra $323 million as a result of this government's decision to increase by 50c a script the cost of essential medicines for pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But pensioners will not be the only ones hit by this measure. Families too will be hit by this attack on access to essential medicines. The Howard government is lifting the maximum cost of pharmaceuticals to $20 a script for families. If a parent suffers from high blood pressure or diabetes, or if a child has asthma, families may need four or more drugs a week. These families will have to find $80 a month to pay for their medicines. Families will have to pay up to $2.60 more for every prescription and could be almost $100 a year worse off.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6020">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to again take issue with a comment that is contained in the minister's second reading speech. He claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members will note that many general users of the scheme will now reach the safety net limit quicker, using fewer prescriptions.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the department did not write that, because there is very clear attempt to mislead this House in that second reading speech. The claim that general users will now reach the safety net limit quicker using fewer prescriptions obviously indicates that, because families will be paying more, they will reach the safety limit quicker. To suggest in some way that people will be better off because they will be paying more for their scripts is quite ludicrous. I think the minister would have a great deal of trouble trying to convince some of the families in his own electorate that they will be better off paying $20 for a script rather than $17.20. But if the minister wants to try then he is welcome to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the unintended honesty of that particular measure is welcomed, it would appear that this is being trumpeted as some virtue of the government's policy. It is quite ridiculous to suggest that ordinary families will be pleased to reach the safety net faster because they are required by this government to pay more for their prescriptions. This attack on families is the sort of thing which is hidden away in this government's slick and sneaky budget. Big neon signs announce the family tax initiative, but higher prices for medicines are one example of the many measures which eat away at any benefits families may be entitled to. This measure will take $180 million from the pockets of general users and ordinary Australian families, in addition to the $323 million which the first measure takes away from pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Also hidden away in the fine print of this bill is the third measure we oppose&mdash;that is, a sneaky change which saves $56 million at the expense of those who need medicines and which goes a long way to showing the difference in the approach to social issues between the Labor Party and coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each year the pharmaceutical co&hyphen;payments for both families and pensioners are indexed for inflation. The Howard government has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> changed the way this will be done. Instead of rounding down to get an even figure to the nearest 10c, they will sometimes be rounded up and sometimes be rounded down. The government's change is the economist's approach, and it is not always the right one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that, in areas like this where small changes in fees can have a big impact on people with very little income, it is important to err on the side of the battlers that we hear the Prime Minister claim to speak for so often. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those battlers will be the ones hit by this government's change in the indexation arrangements. Those battlers will be the ones who have to pay the extra $56 million as a result of the changes in the indexation arrangements. The battling families will be the ones who have to pay an extra $180 million for the increase in the maximum payment for general users. The battling pensioners will be the ones paying $323 million as a result of the higher charge for those users of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The fourth measure in this bill, which we do support, is the restriction of pharmaceutical benefits to Australian citizens, permanent residents and visitors to Australia from countries with which we have reciprocal health care agreements. Visitors from other countries should not expect the taxpayers of Australia to subsidise their pharmaceuticals while they are on holidays in Australia. When Australians travel overseas, I would hope that they do not expect other countries to subsidise their medication. We would expect those expenses to be covered by travel insurance. Visitors to Australia with travel insurance will be able to claim these costs back from their insurer. That is the appropriate way in which these costs should be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> While the opposition supports this measure, I would like to seek an assurance from the government that there will be a practical and workable approach taken by the Health Insurance Commission in dealing with pharmacists on this issue. My understanding from the government and the department is that pharmacists will be expected to check that a person is eligible for the subsidies that are provided under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to Australian citizens, permanent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6021"> residents and also visitors to Australia from countries with which we have reciprocal agreements. I would be concerned if onerous and bureaucratic obligations were placed on pharmacists in implementing this particular decision. When the minister sums up at the end of the second reading debate, I would appreciate an assurance from him that new, onerous, bureaucratic obligations will not be placed on pharmacists as a result of this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would also be interested in the minister's view on what extent Australia should extend the subsidies available under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to all eligible overseas representatives. I can understand that ambassadors from other countries to Australia might be entitled to certain rights under international treaties. But I am not quite sure if Australian diplomats serving in other countries also expect their families and staff who work at overseas embassies to be entitled to all of the pharmaceutical concessions that nationals of those countries receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a question as to whether PBS concessions should be extended not only to ambassadors from other countries serving in Australia but also to their children and to the staff who work at those embassies in Australia. I am sure many of those countries can afford to meet the cost of their pharmaceuticals, or perhaps countries should require staff who are serving at overseas embassies in Australia to have sufficient travel insurance to meet those costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would also like to take this opportunity to place on record some serious concerns I have about one other measure that is referred to in the legislation. I have grave concerns about the government's intention to consider de&hyphen;listing important drugs used in the treatment of hypertension. I am concerned that the government will approach this review with the same cold-hearted accountant's viewpoint which led to the atrocious decision to abolish the Commonwealth dental health program that we have discussed earlier today. I can assure the minister that the opposition will keep a very close eye on developments in this area and will be active in alerting appropriate community groups to this threat so that, unlike <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> many other measures in this budget, the groups affected may actually have an opportunity to comment on a policy before the government locks itself into defending appalling social policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In conclusion, I reiterate that the opposition will oppose three of the measures contained in the legislation but will agree to the fourth measure. The three measures which we are opposing are the increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals for pensioners, the increase in the cost of essential medication for families and the changes in the indexation rounding rules which will hit families and pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that, with this particular legislation, the government has broken the promises that it made before the election in saying that pensioner concessions would be maintained. We believe that the Prime Minister has betrayed the trust he sought from large numbers of pensioners. For many pensioners in my own electorate, this is one measure in particular that is often raised with me. I would say to the Prime Minister that many people in my electorate, who trusted him and thought that he was entitled to have a go, will hold this against him come the time of the next election. For all of these reasons, the opposition opposes the measures that I have outlined in my speech today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to speak on the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996. I would like, first of all, to respond to a couple of the points that the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) made. In terms of honesty, we are in a situation where we were not told by the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), who was then finance minister, that we had a $10.3 billion deficit. We were aware that the country had reached a point of record debt&mdash;with net foreign debt in excess of $180 billion&mdash;and that we were expending four per cent of our gross domestic product servicing our debt and equity obligations. We are now aware that the previous government in five successive budgets accumulated $69 billion in debt, taking our total debt level in government to something like 19 per cent of gross domestic product. That is the environment in which the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6022"> government has had to make decisions in the interests of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier in the MPI, two elderly pensioners in Lindsay when I was there told me to pass on to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that they were happy to pay a bit more for their drugs if it meant that it helped the country get out of trouble. I remind the House that the government has made a commitment to pensioners to continue to index pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. We have also said in the forward estimates that there will be continued indexation of pensions twice yearly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell also said that pensioners `will have to eat into their savings every time they go to the chemist'. That is not true. The average pensioner consumes around 31 prescriptions a year. They would personally only be out of pocket with these measures once they got close to 52 prescriptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that ought to be made is that the member for Dobell is new to this area and I can understand that he is still coming to terms with it. Under the previous government there were changes in the rounding rules, either in the 1992 or 1993 budget, for the Medicare benefits schedule. I think it is quite unreasonable to say that the new government's policy is outrageous when similar kinds of policies were pursued by the previous government.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LEE" NAMEID="MG4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr Lee</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And pharmaceutical benefits?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RW5">Dr NELSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It needs to be pointed out that whilst pharmaceutical benefits are important so too are the benefits that people receive when they visit the doctor. One is no more or less important than the other. If you follow the logic of the opposition, you would consider the doctor's visit to be more important. They felt that a co-payment for that was unacceptable, but they believed that a co-payment for pharmaceuticals was quite acceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This bill implements budget measures to reduce the growth in outlays under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme lists medications that are considered to be essential to the treatment of commonly serious, acute and chronic condi tions. Unfortunately&mdash;and we all own this problem no matter which side of politics we are on&mdash;the pharmaceutical benefits scheme outlays are currently growing at an alarming rate and well in excess of both the consumer price index and the underlying inflation rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of the March federal election, PBS outlays were projected to rise by 50 per cent over the next four years from a base of $2.7 billion, and that was in the absence of any new drugs being listed. The key measure contained in the bill is an increase in the maximum patient contribution from $2.70 to $3.20 per item for pensioners, concession cardholders and safety net prescriptions, and from $17.40 to $20 for general prescriptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a decision that anybody would relish. However, if the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is to survive and if those in need are to continue to have affordable access to essential pharmaceuticals, it is absolutely essential that the beneficiaries of the scheme make a greater contribution to the cost of the drugs for which they are the primary beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard, it is worth recalling that in 1990 when the then Treasurer, Mr Paul Keating, introduced the pharmaceutical co-payment he said of the measure `anything that is free leads to overuse'. The scheme works in the following manner. Pensioners receive $140 annually in addition to the base pension. The purpose of this payment is to cover 52 prescriptions at the existing cost of $2.70 each. After 52 scripts, subsequent drugs are free. The effect of the budget increase from $2.70 to $3.20 would be that it requires pensioners who consume 52 prescriptions to pay a total of $26 over the course of a 12&hyphen;month period when the concessional safety net of $166.40 is reached. Subsequent medications will be free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6023"> There are two points that need to be made. The first is that the average number of prescriptions is around 31. Therefore, most concessional patients will not be spending more than is provided by the government, specifically for the PBS listed medications. The second point is&mdash;and again I emphasise this&mdash;that there are elderly people and pensioners, no matter how difficult their circum stances, and I can assure you that I have a very good idea how hard it is for them, who nonetheless are prepared to accept the fact that they, along with others, will make a contribution to the recovery of the economic situation in which this country finds itself after the profligate spending of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the Keating Labor government increased the general safety net threshold from $400 to $600. It is interesting that the member for Dobell seems concerned about the fact that people will reach that threshold more easily. He neglected to mention that the previous government actually increased it by 50 per cent. This will not change under these proposals. It means that although the non&hyphen;social security beneficiary or working person, the person who has an income, will be required to pay a maximum of $20 for PBS listed drugs&mdash;that is up from $17.40&mdash;the safety net threshold will be reached more quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indexation of patient contributions and the safety net threshold will move to 1 January each year and will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 10c. Again, this is a measure that is consistent with that of the previous government, at least in terms of the Medicare benefits schedule. These measures will provide significant savings to the budget. In total over the four years of the forward estimates it will be $608 million, half of which, $308 million, will be from the increase in the concessional co-payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that Australians appreciate that this is the product of volume. Eighty per cent of prescriptions for PBS items are for concessional payments. It is not that a small number of pensioners will be required to contribute the $308 million in the forward estimates, but there is a very large number of concession cardholders whose relatively small contribution over the course of a year will result in significant savings to the pharmaceutical benefits schemes and growth in outlays and therein ensure the viability of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of other issues are relevant to any discussion of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the prescribing of drugs in general. There were 168 million prescriptions <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> written last year and of those 118 million were subsidised by the PBS. Some critics of the medical profession, including former health ministers, and I note that one of them is in the chamber, have suggested at different times that there is rampant overprescribing of drugs to an unsuspecting public driven by the promotional activities of pharmaceutical companies. I think it is worth putting the issue of consumer demand into perspective&mdash;and I speak as someone who actually spent 13 years working as a family doctor, much of it in one of the poorest socioeconomic areas of Australia. There is a demand for pharmaceuticals which at times appears to be insatiable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to the then Treasurer who, when introducing the scheme six years ago, said that anything that is free leads to overuse. The expectation of people in the community of what benefits drugs will provide to them is at times quite unrealistic. So many times I have had people come along to see me; they describe themselves as having the flu, and they say, `I've come to nip it in the bud,' the implication being that there must be an antibiotic or some other pharmaceutical which is going to cure their problem when, of course, there is not any such cure for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consumer driven aspect and also at times the provider driven dimension of prescribing and the growth of pharmaceuticals have led to something that ought to be disturbing to all members of the parliament. Dr Peter Collignon from Woden Valley Hospital has found that basic antibiotics over the last six or seven years have become considerably less effective than they were in the past. Equally, I wish I had a dollar for every person who has said to me, `I have come to see you because I saw the doctor down the road and I took my 18&hyphen;month&hyphen;old baby along who has a runny nose and a terrible cough and he didn't give me anything for it.' Again, there is the expectation that there must be a cure of some sort, that the doctor must provide some sort of prescription before the person feels satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall, several years ago, going to have my hair cut. The rather petite female hairdresser who was cutting my hair said, `You <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6024"> are the doctor who is on about the bulk billing all the time.' I said that I had made some comments about it on behalf of the medical profession. She said, `My doctor is so much better now that I have gone to one who bulk bills and I don't have to pay anything for it.' I said, `What do you mean by that?' and she said, `I used to pay $25 to get a lecture about why I did not need diet tablets and now I go to a doctor who does not charge me anything and he just gives me whatever I want.' I leave it to members of the House to decide whether they think that is necessarily an appropriate expectation or medical practice. I remember one patient saying to me that her doctor was so much better since he started providing a free service for her because before he did that he would see the child with an ear infection only once and now he sees that same child three times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, in the area of pharmaceuticals there needs to be seen, contrary to what I understand the opposition will put up in this debate, a degree of social and educational responsibility in what the government is doing with the pharmaceutical co&hyphen;payment. One of the things that we need to be looking at in the area of pharmaceuticals&mdash;and I give credit to the previous government for this; and we will certainly be continuing it&mdash;is education, not only of medical providers but also of the community; to constantly have people saying, `Do I need a drug at all, is there a non&hyphen;drug alternative available to me, what are the benefits of taking this drug and what are the potential side effects of taking it?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the advantages which may come from the Council of Australian Government's program, again initiated by the previous government, is that we might find, once we have gone through this process and we have trialled the coordinated care trials with family doctors, that prescribers will have better access, particularly for lower income people, to non&hyphen;drug treatments. It may be easier to get physiotherapy, counselling or whatever may be required as a more appropriate treatment than a drug for a problem a person has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to change perceptions and expectations. People need to understand that good medicine does not mean giving an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> antibiotic for the cold; that influenza, herpes, measles, mumps, chickenpox, gastroenteritis and all these things are viral illnesses for which there is no cure. We need to put some resources aside into changing community expectations. We have changed them in relation to smoking and, thankfully, the attitudes of people in relation to HIV&hyphen;AIDS and other serious conditions. If we can change expectations through education we will do a lot to reduce the rate of growth of outlays in pharmaceuticals and, hopefully, avoid some of the negative consequences of taking medication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other important initiatives with which the government is proceeding is providing feedback to doctors about their prescribing habits. If you take a group of prescribers in a particular area and give them simple, factual information as to how many non&hyphen;steroidal anti&hyphen;inflammatories, how many antibiotics or how many anti&hyphen;hypertensives they prescribe and if a doctor discovers that he or she is the No. 1 provider of drugs in that area, there is no question in my mind that that will have a positive impact on the person's prescribing behaviour. The more information we can give to prescribers the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other challenge that needs to be addressed is that of nursing home prescribing. I know the member for Dobell frequently refers to quite reputable and authoritative publications but he may have missed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> where Snowdon's study of July 1995 showed that 58.9 per cent of residents in nursing homes are on some kind of neuroleptic&mdash;a tranquilliser, for those who are not knowledgeable in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things we ought to consider as a government is using divisions of general practice, again another very good and positive initiative of the previous government, and provide funding for those divisions to employ a pharmacist who can then work with general practitioners, meeting on a regular fortnightly or monthly basis, to review drug prescribing behaviour and patterns in nursing homes and residential aged care institutions. Then we can extend into the community the setting of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6025"> kinds of standards we expect to be provided in teaching and secondary hospital settings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other challenge which needs to be pursued, certainly by the medical and pharmaceutical professions&mdash;with the support of the government&mdash;is prescribing guidelines. I refer honourable members, again in particular the member for Dobell, to the 16 September edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> 1996. It has a very good editorial which covers the issue of improving drug prescribing. I will read just a little of it. The editorial pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People ought not to be too frightened of prescribing guidelines. They are extremely useful in a wide variety of clinical situations, and they should be seen as genuine attempts by independent experts and peers to give guidance to professionals who are striving to do their best for their patients, but there are areas of therapeutics and aspects of the use of certain drugs, particularly new drugs, which individuals could be expected, not always, to carry at his or her fingertips.</PARA>
<PARA>The other dimension which hopefully will have a positive impact on prescribing patterns in Australia is the progressive computerisation of medical practice, which still remains distressingly slow but is starting to gain some momentum. If we had computerised prescribing, it obviously would be possible to eliminate transcription errors and to warn a prescriber very quickly of prospective drug interaction. Research from the Canadian PharmaNet system would suggest that it has been particularly effective over there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could also link prescribing guidelines and drug information to computerised prescribing. If a medical practitioner is prescribing a particular medication, he or she could immediately become aware of the guidelines that would apply to a particular condition and the drug that has been prescribed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I appreciate&mdash;the nature of politics being what it is&mdash;that the opposition will oppose this. Understandably, they will reflect some of the attitudes and concerns of those in the community who, understandably, do not like having to pay any more at all for anything, in particular for pharmaceuticals. But our responsibility as leaders&mdash;as we ought to be&mdash;is to remind the community that if we want to continue to have access to high quality medi cations, and if we want to continue to be able to respond in a positive manner to issues like listing beta interferon for multiple sclerosis or listing pulmozyme for cystic fibrosis, we need to do whatever is reasonably possible to see that every Australian&mdash;whether they be a pensioner or an income earner&mdash;makes a contribution, proportionate to the cost of that benefit that they derive, which helps us maintain the sustainability of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have the figures in front of me&mdash;please excuse me if I am wrong when I say this&mdash;but since about 1992 the contribution by concessional cardholders to the cost of pharmaceuticals has increased by about 0.9 per cent. In the same period of time, the cost of those drugs to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme has jumped by about 34 per cent. So this government, as I think the previous government did, is bending over backwards to see that the people who most need it still receive the vast majority of support and subsidy that they should receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, working families will have to pay another $2.60, but they will reach that safety net threshold much more quickly. The people who will be hit most by it are people like us in this place&mdash;people who work, people who perhaps do not often need pharmaceuticals but who perhaps ought to pay a bit more when they do need them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might have cause to agree with some of what the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) had to say, except that, overall, we did not see any increase in funding in health care; we saw a very significant reduction. There was a cut of over $2 billion to health care, most of which was used to offset the introduction of a private health insurance rebate, which will have very little impact indeed on the quality or the amount of health care available to Australian citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to address this National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill in the context of those cuts because it is in that context that they assume their importance. Of course governments will make adjustments from time to time in the contribution that individuals make to their health care, aged care or education&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;but <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6026"> they usually do so in the context of improving services and expanding the range and quality of what is available to citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget, in my recent experience, is unique in that it does not do that. All of the cuts that we have seen to the health budget are basically designed to offset the very great expense of a single measure which I think most people&mdash;particularly health economists who have examined it&mdash;conclude will have almost no impact on the quality, let alone the extent, of services available in the health care system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the principles that is in danger of being undermined in the current debate about health care and, indeed, by the approach that the government is taking in its budget and other measures bill is the principle of universal provision and universal access. It is the idea that we all subscribe to a quality health care system and pay according to our means so that those people who are not very well off pay little or nothing by way of contribution&mdash;whether through the general tax system or the Medicare levy&mdash;but they may at other times in their life, and this is typical, make a payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a view that people of low means stay that way forever. It might seem like that to some people at the moment, but it is certainly not true for the most part. People come and go from the work force. When they retire they have a lesser means, but during their lifetime they will have made a very substantial contribution not only via the work and effort that they have put in&mdash;whether it was well remunerated or not&mdash;but also through the tax system. So the principle of paying according to your means is a very important one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beside that is the principle of making sure that the system is embraced by all in society. In the area of health care, there has always been the view&mdash;I have heard it expressed by members of government, and it has been directed at me by way of criticism&mdash;that if you can afford it you should have private health insurance; you should look after yourself. That is a very serious misunderstanding of what I think is the contract between the government and the citizens in the areas of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> health care, education, transport and environmental protection, where the purchase of a collective good is much more important than the exercise of a single, individual choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if I stay in the health care system or the education system as a relatively high income earner&mdash;indeed, by community standards, a high income earner&mdash;and I pay more tax in order to do that, it is benefiting in two ways those people in the community who do not have very much. Firstly, my tax is going to that purpose. I will not be pushing to have my tax dollar removed and given to some other purpose, like a private health insurance rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second is that members of the community, if they see that the well-heeled and well-off are absenting themselves from what is considered to be the universal provision because they believe that there is something better somewhere else&mdash;whether it is a private school or private hospital&mdash;will, of course, lose confidence in the system. So I have a very strong commitment to the idea of, firstly, collective purchase&mdash;that we can jointly purchase better services for everybody&mdash;and, secondly, a contribution according to our means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my health care&mdash;in the education of my son, in other areas of my life&mdash;I have remained strongly committed to, and have personally acted upon it when I was not so wealthy, the view that the universal system had a lot to offer me. Now that I am better off as a member of parliament, I want to make a contribution to that, rather than say, as John Kenneth Galbraith has said in the United States, `If it is not going to benefit me, I don't want to contribute'&mdash;the culture of contentment, if you like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very obvious in the United States that you have this two&hyphen;tiered system that says, `If I have private provision'&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;`then I don't want other people using my taxes for quality hospital care or education' or whatever it may be. So it is in that context that I make these observations about the approach the government is taking, including the approach to pharmaceutical benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen in this budget is a very substantial cut to hospital funding. I cannot see any reason to justify that on the grounds <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6027"> of improved quality or access. Indeed, everything I know about the hospital system and the health care system generally points to the fact that the last decade has seen already very substantial improvements in productivity and efficiency and most hospitals are at the point now where they cannot spread the dollar any thinner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, at the state level, because there were very significant cuts, particularly in Victoria, in my home state of Western Australia and in South Australia, what the hospitals did, in a sense quite sensibly, to ensure their survival was to cost shift to the Commonwealth. I railed against that as a minister because it clearly is not desirable to have this dollar movement between the two levels of government without any improvement in the quality of care. But I understood why the hospitals were doing it. It was because the state governments were cutting off their funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Victoria, they were explicitly encouraged wherever they could to, for instance, purchase pharmaceuticals via an outside system that would enable them to access the pharmaceutical benefits system rather than having to pay for the drugs in&hyphen;house. It was a similar case with clinicians, physiotherapy and the like. All of it was being pushed out of the hospital campuses because they were not getting enough dollars from state governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) now tells us that that cost shifting, which he estimates as being worth nearly $313 million, since that is what he is taking out of the budget over four years, will be remedied by simply taking the money from the hospitals. All that will do is ensure that the hospitals have no capacity to continue to deliver quality of service to the range of services that has previously been the case. That $313 million that is taken out of hospitals will produce these effects&mdash;longer waiting lists in the case of elective surgery, a very serious threat to the quality of care in the case of emergency and other medical requirements in the hospital, and it will also mean that individuals pay more, because a lot of the services which the hospitals have just managed to continue to provide&mdash;physiotherapy, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> occupational therapy, social work and so on&mdash;will now have to be purchased by the individual consumer outside the hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some people, about 30&hyphen;plus per cent of the population, their private health insurance will help to cover them for that. But for the majority, it will not. They will simply have to pick up the tab. It is still an economically rational decision, I might say, not to have private health insurance, even with the government's tax rebate system. I will return to that in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost shifting reduction undertaken by the government will have an impact on hospital care. I had the pleasure recently of visiting the base hospital in Geelong. They made it very clear to me, `We have done everything we can. We have broken down the demarcation problems that we faced in the hospital between people who did the cooking and the cleaning and people who provided orderly services. We are all capable now of doing anything that is required of us.' The hospital's work force has been very substantially reduced. The costs of operation have been very significantly cut under the Victorian government's removal of $270 million from that system. But they said, `We cannot cut any further without having a very major impact on the quality of the care that we deliver.' They said it was spread so thin that some of it was skeletal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of the cuts for so&hyphen;called cost shifting problems&mdash;they are real, but this is not the solution to them; it is to get agreements with the states&mdash;there are cuts, of course, to states grants under the FAG system of $450 million. So the cumulative impact of those two sets of cuts is to remove $800 million from the public hospital system over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is already leading to substantial further cuts by the states. They are not going to make up the difference. They do not have a capacity to do so. In some cases they do not have the will to do so, because part of their agenda&mdash;particularly the conservative governments&mdash;is to move as many people as they can out of the public system and into the private system, because they do not pay for that. Private health insurance does, the government does now, with this huge rebate, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6028"> and Medicare does to a certain extent when it comes to the medical services. So that is undermining that very important principle that I outlined earlier&mdash;a quality public system; not denying the right to choice in the private system, but not having that as an alternative, as a substitute, for decent universal provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been discussion today&mdash;I will not dwell on it&mdash;of the very significant cuts to the dental program. This is a program that was targeted to low income earners. It has never been a universal provision, but it did assist those low income earners and health care cardholders to get decent dental care in a timely fashion. We have seen $400 million cut from that program, with the inevitable result that there will be longer waiting times, fewer procedures will be able to be undertaken and access will be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of the dental clinics that have been funded by the joint application of Commonwealth and state funds will be closed. They simply will not be able to maintain the operation of those clinics. So it is not just that people will have to wait longer, but the clinic in their area may not be available at all. The local private dentist who was providing some of the services under the Commonwealth dental program will also not be available.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think it is important for the member who has just spoken to recognise that these cuts are in the context, as I pointed out, of very substantial cuts to other areas of programs. So they add insult to injury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of the observations I am making is that you have these very substantial cuts, over $2 billion, while simultaneously having the introduction of a private health insurance rebate. The government was warned before the election by health economists and others that this would simply be money that would purchase no additional service and it would inevitably result in the increased cost either of health insurance premiums or of some of the co&hyphen;payments required by doctors and, in some cases, hospitals. If you put that much extra money into the system with no caps, with no restriction on what either the health insurance funds can charge for their premiums or the hospitals and doctors can charge for the private services that they provide, there will inevitably be an escalation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any first year high school economist, let alone university economist, will tell you that. Indeed, a lot of work was done on this; it is not as though it came out of nowhere and no&hyphen;one understood what the effects would be. So all of us, whether we have private health insurance or not, are contributing to something that is enjoyed by a minority&mdash;some 35 per cent to 40 per cent depending on the state; $1.7 billion is taken out of the public system provided by the 70&hyphen;odd per cent who have no other form of cover and provided to the 30 per cent who have private health insurance. And in such a way, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) discovered, that you have no control over the cost. So there is an immediate escalation in the price of private health insurance, driven in part by the expectation of higher costs from doctors and hospitals. The Prime Minister panics because he realises there is nothing he can do about that and says, `In future, these increases will have to be the subject of prime ministerial and Treasury consideration, along with the health minister.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This all happened when the health minister was away. I am sure had he been here it would never have occurred because he knows&mdash;and the Prime Minister has now figured it out too&mdash;that the last thing you want is political interference on an ad hoc basis on the price charged for private health insurance premiums as there are statutory <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6029"> requirements for those funds to hold certain reserves and their payments are based on the costs to them of paying the doctors and hospitals who are making claims. So it is not the private health insurance funds who are driving this, it is the hospitals and doctors in the private system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farce of the involvement of the Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Costello) has been revealed. By having said they wanted to control these private health insurance costs, they have now had to agree that they have no control over them whatever. The only way you can control these matters is by having some form of legislation in place to effectively change the way that that $1.7 billion is applied rather than having it simply slip into the system apparently unnoticed but with huge costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefit to the consumer of this rebate has disappeared already. We are only six months in and it has not even been applied. Before they get the benefit of the rebate the health insurance costs will have risen to totally absorb the costs of the rebate. This is a political decision, and the Productivity Commission is not the body to examine private health insurance. I doubt that they have the skills and, judging from some of their former considerations, certainly not the right attitude either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk too about the pharmaceutical benefits because they are an insult added to injury, particularly the co&hyphen;payments for pensioners. In the past, whenever co&hyphen;payments were increased, we were very clear that there had to be a corresponding increase in the pension; they could not be absorbed by people on such low incomes and it was important to be fair and reasonable about this. These people have so little disposable income that, with the best will in the world, if you simply increase the co&hyphen;payment without any corresponding change in their pension, even if they are only part&hyphen;pensioners, then you significantly handicap their ability to purchase other services and goods that they need just to survive from day to day. Even with the safety net provisions, a considerable hardship will be placed on those older people, those on concessions who are not necessarily the ones <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> using most of the service. In other words, they do not even get to the safety net level. Nonetheless, it will have a very significant impact on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general increase has many of the same characteristics. It hits the people least able to afford it because it is effectively a flat tax. It effectively hits everybody in the same way regardless of their means. That is bad enough. But along with that change, which is very significant&mdash;you are talking about $323 million being saved by the co&hyphen;payment for pensioners, the general increase contributing $179 million&mdash;is this mean little measure of the rounding provisions. I could not believe my ears when this came through in the bill. I quote the minister's second reading speech because it is entertaining to say the least. I do not know who wrote this but they should get a bit of a whack. If they are here in the House, I apologise to them. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been of concern for some time that the previous rounding process worked against the interests of the taxpayer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I could not believe that phrase&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and these changes are considered to be a fairer method of sharing the rises&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Fairer to whom? These people have so little in the way of resources at the moment that the taxpayers, generally speaking, would be more than happy to assist them in purchasing the medicines necessary for their health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to the member for Bradfield about why we have such overprescription and the importance of education, I agree with him about the remedies. We need to educate doctors, pharmacists and the general community about the dangers of inappropriate and excessive prescribing. But I always choke on the observation that you blame the patient first; that it is these dreadful patients who come up to you and say, `Doctor, I want a prescription for my viral illness'&mdash;a cold or whatever it happens to be&mdash;`and if you don't give it to me, I'll go to another doctor' and the doctor says, `Yes, Sir' or `Madam' as if they had no clinical judgment at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A doctor is in a position of authority and power and the patient will listen to them. To say, `I have to give the prescription otherwise the doctor down the road will' shows the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6030"> morals of an alley cat. Most of the doctors I know will not do that. They say, `No, I will not provide you with a prescription. I'll explain to you why it would not be a helpful thing to do. I'll explain to you how you can manage the symptoms of your illness and together we will make sure that you recover as quickly as possible.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say that doctors are really the victims of the patients when it comes to overprescribing is to severely undermine the medical profession because it shows them as incapable of making sound judgments in the interests of the patients and, frankly, I do not believe it. It is just a way of shifting the blame because a lot of doctors are not as careful as they might be about prescribing&mdash;not because the patients are these horrible dragons who otherwise would take away their livelihood. The other changes that have occurred in the past in improving medical education, particularly about pharmaceuticals, need to be continued and expanded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just a couple of other elements, given the context of this change, that deserve some attention from the community at large. Firstly, the changes to the medical work force: there will be an opportunity to debate this further but the minister has been all over the shop on this; he does not really know where he wants to go. First of all, he wants to cut the access of medical students to provider numbers. When there is a huge outcry about that he says, `Hang on, we'll do that but not many of you will be affected because we'll cut off medical migration.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very committed to the idea of reducing the number of people who migrate to Australia and then expect to practise medicine here. We increased the penalty for medical migration and made changes that ensured that the New Zealanders were not simply able to walk in here and take up a medical provider number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the minister would appear to be saying that at the same time he is going to allow temporary resident doctors&mdash;I will have to check this&mdash;to sit the medical exams and add to the number of overseas trained doctors in the community. He has no way, as far as I know, of insisting that they stay in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country, where there is a serious undersupply of doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I object very severely to these changes, not least because they come on top of some unhelpful and very callous cuts which undermine the very important principle of universal provision of quality health care.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pharmaceutical benefits scheme has been in this country for about 40 years. It is designed to provide access to pharmaceuticals for Australians, regardless of their circumstances, at a reasonable cost. This scheme has been supported by successive governments. Over the years since the scheme was introduced, the rise in co&hyphen;payments, on average, has been only one per cent per annum. But the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, as with other areas of medical expenditure, continues to skyrocket. Estimates for the 1995-96 year show that the cost of the scheme in that year alone will rise by about 16.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We aim to provide reasonable access to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme for all Australians, but one must remember that on 2 March we inherited Beazley's bankcard bill of $10.3 billion. We realise that one has to run a country the way one would run one's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> own household budget, so one simply cannot go on spending more than one earns. We did not create the problem, but we do accept that, as the elected government of Australia, we have a mandate and a responsibility to fix it&mdash;and fix it we will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure in this bill whereby we will increase the co-payment for people accessing benefits under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is a step we take reluctantly. It is however a budget measure, and it is designed to contribute $74.2 million in 1996-97 and a total of $534.5 million over the following three years. This is an example of economic responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that, to continue this scheme, we need to increase slightly the level of co&hyphen;payments from $2.70 to $3.20 per item for concessional benefit and safety net prescriptions, and from $17.40 to $20 for general prescriptions. As I said, we are taking these steps with very great reluctance, but we take these steps because we have to. We need to plug the budget black hole, and this legislation is a contribution from the Department of Health and Family Services to this end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has given a very strong commitment to Medicare, and most people in the country would accept that we have kept this commitment absolutely. The honourable member for Fremantle whinged and whined rather pathetically for 15 of her 20 minutes, but in doing so she failed to tell us the terrible record the former Labor government had in the area of health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, being a gentleman well versed in these matters, you would understand what a failure the former Labor government was. You would understand that, when we came to office, more than 100,000 Australians were waiting in queues for elective surgery, and a third of those had been waiting for over six months. On the Sunshine Coast and elsewhere, there were very long waiting queues. I have spoken to some specialists who said that, when they contacted the hospital to make arrangements for people to come in for elective surgery, they found that some people had actually died while on the waiting list. I have seen delays of not just six months but delays of up to five years for elective surgery, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6032"> surgery which is necessary in many cases to alleviate excruciating conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The private health insurance crisis was one issue which we had to confront. We brought forward a very positive budget initiative designed to provide incentives for people in Australia to re-enter private health. We aim to keep our promises, unlike the former government. The Labor Party promised not to raise the Medicare levy, but did so. You simply cannot trust them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really pathetic that we find Labor speaker after Labor speaker after Labor speaker crawling into this place to criticise our record over the last seven or eight months, when what we have aimed to do is restore Australia's health system, provide health care to Australians and keep our election promises. In doing so, regrettably, we must increase the co-payment to $3.20 for concessional benefit prescriptions and $20 for general benefit prescriptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be recognised, however, that the previous safety net arrangements will be kept in place. The concessional safety net will rise to $166.40, an increase of $26 per year. That represents, as now, 52 concessional items per year. Prescriptions after this will continue to be free to those patients. Also, many concessional patients do not need 52 scripts a year, which means any additional costs to them will be less than the $26 annual co&hyphen;payment increase. The $600 general safety net threshold will not change, so the number of prescriptions taken to reach it will actually fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one way in which we aim to raise slightly the amount of money which we get from co&hyphen;payments to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Obviously we as a nation have a problem because the cost of pharmaceuticals continues to spiral. As a government, we are committed to ensuring that Australians have access to pharmaceuticals, so what we have to do is look at options to reduce expenditure and get some extra income to offset what we are spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks at the overall health budget, one sees a rise of 5.9 per cent compounded each year. We have given a commitment to maintain the Medicare system. Therefore, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what we need to do is be responsible economic managers, and the bill before the House is one of those responsible economic measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other options with respect to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme that the government could have looked at. The government could have looked at cashing out benefits and making sure that everyone pays $20 rather than $3.20, subject to the safety net, and increasing pensions to cover the cost of that cashing out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, and we have received a reference from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) in relation to concession cards. Submissions have been made to that committee with respect to cashing out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was initially rudely interrupted by the honourable member for Werriwa and his colleagues and later interrupted by the dinner suspension, I was talking to the bill currently before the House. I mentioned that I was Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs and that the Minister for Social Security had given a reference to the committee to look into certain matters relating to concession cards. Of course, the key concession which people receive from concession cards is access to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme at concessional rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems that we have is that the costs of this scheme continue to skyrocket and spiral. I mentioned earlier in my speech that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will cost some 16.5 per cent more in 1995-96. Indeed, it is interesting to note that PBS outlays now total about $2.7 billion and that these will rise 50 per cent in cost over the next four years without the pressure of any new drugs being listed. So clearly what government must do is seek to limit overuse of the scheme and, indeed, ensure that the co-payment covers the greater part of the cost of providing these pharmaceuticals to Australians. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6033">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be noted that amongst the submissions received by the House of Representatives standing committee is a submission which recommended, favourably, the PharmaNet trial which has taken place in British Columbia. This is a very interesting trial because it is really a win, win, win situation for the community. Pharmacists are linked with the system and, when patients go to pharmacies to have their prescriptions filled, the identification of the client is checked against the clinical conditions of the client and prior drug prescriptions. It is possible for the pharmacist to decline to supply a drug to someone who might have had too many drugs in the past, to someone who has just had that drug prescribe or to someone who might well have an adverse reaction to that drug.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this trial in British Columbia they have been able to reduce the overprescription of drugs. There is, of course, an incentive for pharmacists to do the right thing. In the event of a pharmacist determining that a prescription ought not to be filled for certain reasons, provided those reasons are valid, then the pharmacist still gets paid a dispensing fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What government needs to do is to take a responsible approach to this area as indeed to other areas of governmental activity. We need to continue to give Australians, regardless of their economic circumstances, access to world quality pharmaceuticals and medicines. We need to do this in a financially responsible way. As a nation and as a government our financial situation is somewhat critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 March we inherited a budget deficit of $10.3 billion. An enormous amount of money was absent from the Treasury despite the fact that, in the run&hyphen;up to the election campaign, the then Minister for Finance&mdash;the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley)&mdash;and the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, who is now retired, told us that the budget was in surplus. They said that they were not able to tell us exactly what the situation was because the numbers had not been done, but that the budget was in surplus.</PARA>

We are sorry that we have to bring this bill into the parliament, but what we must do is to take a financially responsible approach to the economic management of this country. You simply cannot continue to build up debt on the Bankcard. You simply cannot keep running the printing presses. You simply cannot spend more than you earn. That is why, regrettably, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), as part of budget measures, had to introduce this bill into the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, this bill continues the basic thrusts of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It continues to provide high quality, world&hyphen;class pharmaceuticals to all Australians, regardless of circumstances. Pensioners will pay $3.20 per script instead of $2.70.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) has just devoted most of the time available to him on the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill to attempting to divert attention away from the nasties contained within it by attacking the health record of the former Labor government. The truth is that those opposite are jealous of the health record of the former Labor government. They hate Medicare. They hate its success. They hate its universality. What they really hate most is the fact that the Australian people love it so much that it has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6034"> forced them to discard their ideological differences with it and to embrace it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I come into this place to speak on legislation it is necessary again and again to express my disappointment at the fact that this government has broken yet another election promise. The National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996 certainly represents another broken promise. As the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) pointed out earlier, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in his so&hyphen;called Headland speech to the Australian Council of Social Service in October last year, promised the audience:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will maintain the real value of pensions and other social security benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>Let's be clear about it: this bill reduces the value of pensions, and it comes on top of a number of attacks on older Australians contained within the 1996&hyphen;97 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I list amongst those attacks the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program, which was the topic of the MPI earlier today&mdash;a most callous attack on older Australians in particular. I list the $6.80 per week now being imposed on something like 200,000 pensioners who rely on the home and community care program to remain in their homes, and who, by doing so, save the government money. I list changes to the deeming provisions which will make the first $2,000 of pensioner savings assessable under the income test. And, of course, I list the decision to withhold the 1 November Medicare fee increases, which will surely put pressure on some general practitioners to cease bulk&hyphen;billing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, I list the decision by this government to impose an entry fee for nursing homes on older Australians. I am getting a little bit tired of hearing members on the government side telling us that the nursing home entry fee is merely a logical extension of the fee imposed by the former Labor government on hostels. That is a load of rubbish. The move to a hostel is a lifestyle choice, one which can be planned well in advance. But when it comes time to enter a nursing home, usually there is no choice and no time to plan finances in advance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have this pharmaceutical benefits scheme slug. The bill increases the cost of prescriptions for pensioners from $2.70 to $3.20, a 50c or 18 per cent increase. It is an increase which, for the first time, breaks the nexus between the imposition of a prescription charge for concession card holders and the compensatory rise in the pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) talking earlier about a pensioner couple he bumped into while campaigning in the seat of Lindsay. He told us that the pensioner couple assured him that they did not mind paying a little bit more for their pharmaceuticals or contributing a little more to the cost of their health service, as long as it was for the good of the country. The member for Bradfield is talking to a much different breed of pensioner than the ones I regularly talk to in my electorate. The pensioners I talk to in my electorate are outraged by this arbitrary rise in the prescription fee, and so they should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I painstakingly went through the speeches of honourable members on the other side made during the debate on the bill which introduced the prescription fee for pensioners in 1990. I did so with the view of throwing back at present government members some of the statements they might have made in opposition to the bill at that time. But, alas, bar the words of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), I could not find anything from members on the other side that showed they were prepared to get up and attack the government of the day for the imposition of this prescription charge. Why should I be surprised? It is obvious now that they believed at the time that the measure did not go far enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found that many of them spent most of their time defending the chemists&mdash;who, at the time, had formed quite a close allegiance with the Liberal Party and were doing quite a bit of campaigning during the 1990 election. But let me return to what the lonely member for O'Connor had to say in 1990 with respect to the introduction of the co&hyphen;payment for concession card holders:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As is usual with most of the Government's policies, Government members, the proponents of social <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6035"> justice, hit the poor in the community, the needy and the aged.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet, the former government's Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill compensated pensioners 100 per cent&mdash;a $2.50 charge, a $2.50 rise in the rate of pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1990 decision by the former Labor government was a very brave one, but it was a justifiable decision, designed not to slug pensioners but to discourage the accumulation of drugs in bathroom cupboards and to address the forever rising cost of both new and existing drugs. It was a decision designed to address the ever&hyphen;burgeoning cost of the PBS, now costing the nation, as the member for Fisher has pointed out, some $2.7 billion each year. But it was designed to do so without whacking those least able to pay. It was a clever decision, one which addressed the problem while maintaining the scheme's most basic aim: affordability of pharmaceuticals for all; access to pharmaceuticals for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why has the government chosen for the first time to break this nexus between the co&hyphen;payment and the compensatory rise in the pension? It is because it means some $308 million to the government's coffers over four years. That means $308 million out of the pockets of concession card holders. There is no other way of looking at it. It is simple arithmetic. How can you say that the government will raise an extra $308 million over four years yet concession card holders will be no worse off?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families will also be hit as a result of this bill. The cost of a prescription for working families will now be $20, an increase of $2.60 or 15 per cent. It is another arbitrary increase which will raise some $180 million over four years. That is $180 million out of the pockets of working families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you add the $56 million which will be raised by changing the rounding rules, the total slug of this bill is some $544 million over four years. It is a regressive slug upon those with the least ability to pay. Families on $200,000 per year will pay an additional $2.60 per script. What will a family on $25,000 per year pay? An additional $2.60 per script. This will be small change to some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the share portfolio managers on the front bench on the other side, but I can assure the House that it is a substantial amount of money to working Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This impost on Australian families comes on top of a number of budget initiatives which will hit those same families. There are higher child care costs, higher costs to families sending their children to university and a range of social security benefit tightening measures contained within the budget. As I mentioned when speaking on the impact on older Australians, the decision to withhold the Medicare fee increases is likely to deny them the opportunity to be bulk&hyphen;billed by general practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue which will have its greatest impact on rural and regional Australia where there exists a shortage of general practitioners. That is another topic I will comment on in another piece of legislation. The government's budget is full of cuts which will impact disproportionately upon rural and regional Australia. There is no greater piece of evidence of the government's abandonment of rural and regional Australia than its decision to abolish the division of regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition opposes the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996. This bill is very aptly named, I suggest. The inclusion of the words `budget measures' is most appropriate because the bill epitomises the budget strategy. It epitomises its heartlessness. It epitomises the total lack of understanding on the part of its architects of the fact that it is sustainable economic growth which will take the government's budget back to surplus. More clearly, it reflects the government's determination to impose the bulk of the pain of its deficit reduction program on those with the least ability to sustain the attack, that being the older in our community and low income working class families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also deny access to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme of those persons who are not eligible to receive Medicare benefits. This means that pharmaceutical subsidies will be denied to visitors to Australia who are not citizens or residents or who are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6036"> not from countries with whom Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement. I support this measure, as does the opposition, which will save some $71 million over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that the government has broken the nexus between the concessional co&hyphen;payment and the compensatory pension payment increase that should go with it, what are we to expect in the future? Can we expect that every year when the government sits down to deliberate on the budget that it will see the PBS charge as an easy mark, an easy revenue measure?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government's word counts for very little following the enormous list of broken promises and commitments in its short term of office, I call upon it to guarantee that there will be no further increases in the co-payment either for concession cardholders or non-concession cardholders for the life of this parliament. I think that is a reasonable request. I think it will put some confidence back into the system. I think it is fair and reasonable that pensioners, the older members of our community, the members of our community that have contributed so much, should have an expectation that the charge should not rise any further.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak tonight on the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996 with no great feeling of pleasure. Indeed, I believe this bill is typical of so much of the change that this government has attempted to sneak in through the back door because it knows, as we on this side of the House know, and as the community are now discovering, these measures are penny pinching at its meanest and most devastating. In particular, I join my colleagues in opposing the increases to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme co&hyphen;payments. This bill under discussion raises a concessional co-payment for medication under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme for health care cardholders from $2.70 to $3.20 and for general patients from $17.40 to $20.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my colleague the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) alluded, these increases of 50c and $2.60 no doubt seem meagre, minor and insignificant to members sitting on the other side of the House. No <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doubt when their mind is heavy with the weighty problems of which of their tens of thousands of dollars in shares they are going to sell, no doubt when they are wading their way through the enormous number of pages in their share portfolio, no doubt when they are spending hours trying to collate the family fortune in shares held by their close relatives, no doubt when they are frantically trying to find answers to the questions quite rightly raised by this side of the House, no doubt when they are trying to cover up from the public eye the enormous wealth that sits in the share portfolios of so many of their members, which quite clearly indicates how removed those on that side of the House are from average Australians, that 50c and $2.60 would seem like change that they could lose out of their pocket and not even realise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an earlier debate today, I heard the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) claim&mdash;indeed, he repeated it in later debate on this bill&mdash;that when he was campaigning in the Lindsay by-election, two nameless pensioners&mdash;I actually suspect they might be Mr and Mrs Wright; and we know all about them&mdash;came to up him and said that they did not mind paying the extra 50c or an extra couple of dollars. I spent some time in the Lindsay area in the lead-up to the by-election and certainly no pensioners said that to me. All I can say is that the pensioners the honourable member for Bradfield met when he was campaigning on the streets of Penrith were very different from the pensioners I met and most certainly were very different from the pensioners at Oak Flats, Port Kembla, Dapto, Warilla and Albion Park in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> When I talked about people not missing 50c or $2.60 from their pockets, this is most certainly not the case for many people out there in our community struggling on day-to-day budgets to cover their normal living costs and to maintain their families. Our constituents on pensions and low incomes must be very worried, sitting on their lounges tonight watching on their televisions the pitiful and, no doubt to them, incomprehensible debates over hundreds of thousands of dollars of shares held by the wealthy gentry on the other <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6037"> side of the chamber. The comparison is stark, and a disgrace to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In June this year, a local community health group in my electorate held a public meeting which a member of my staff attended&mdash;I was actually here in Canberra. The meeting was called to gather views from the public about the impact the operation of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme had on individuals and families. The group was particularly interested to hear from pensioners and low income families. The meeting was very well attended and many issues were raised by the people present which were forwarded to the National Health Consumer Forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let me tell you one story raised at that meeting. This story was related by a mother with three asthmatic children who graphically detailed for the group the daily struggle faced by her family in meeting their health care costs. Unlike the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), in Throsby we do not need to invent families to make our point. We do not have to have a Mr and Mrs Wright. We have the families there. They are constantly at our door with true stories of the daily impact this government, in its zealous drive to squeeze the underprivileged, is having on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Her husband, luckily for the family, has a full-time job, but it is very low paying. She had been working to help the family budget meet the many demands a young family faces today. However, the youngest child is not only an asthmatic but also suffers from attention deficit disorder. In order to look after this child, she had to leave employment. They are not, however, eligible for disability support for this child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular mother painted a clear picture of day-to-day life for her family in trying to provide the medication needed for her children. The woman knows what `shares' mean. To her it means her children regularly having to share inhalers until they can get enough money to buy another one. The family also struggles to provide swimming sessions for the children in an attempt to prevent serious occurrences of asthma. They must always have double medication for the two oldest children because one inhaler must be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> left at the school. The youngest child uses a special spacer to help inhalation. This costs extra. The mother told of her despair and anger at the children when the spacer was accidentally broken&mdash;an overreaction caused by the financial stress of providing in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is often these additional costs that are not part of the standard calculation of health care costs that create added burdens for families and individuals with chronic illnesses. The costs of other treatments such as medical tests, aids and appliances, nutritional supplements, and preventive treatment all add to the stress on their budget. And probably most pitifully, this mother told, in some embarrassment, of the birthday presents for the children she had requested from the grandparents this year. The birthday presents were dust mite covers for their beds. It is quite clear from this example that families in these circumstances are already being denied the maximum opportunity to deal in the most effective and efficient manner with chronic illnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This family's circumstances are not unusual. This is a real dilemma facing families on low incomes every day of every week for the whole year. An extra $2.60 for each medication for them is a significant problem. When you recognise that usually they are purchasing three or more scripts at a time, the amount of money is compounded. If more than one family member is affected by the illness, then stretching the budget can become an impossible task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other families at the meeting told of having to make decisions, when given scripts by doctors, whether or not to have them filled. Chemists also made submissions to the health group indicating that often patients would come into pharmacies and ask the chemist which of the scripts they could do without because they could not afford them all. And this in the lucky country!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Individuals also told of extremely dangerous decisions they were forced into making&mdash;including taking out&hyphen;of&hyphen;date medicines that were left over from previous illnesses; self-medication with over&hyphen;the&hyphen;counter medicines, such as pain relief tablets and supermarket <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6038"> cough and flu medications; using medicines prescribed for other family members or friends that the untrained relative, friend or ill person determined would be appropriate; or&mdash;most worrisome of all&mdash;not taking any medication at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> People on low incomes who are not entitled to a health care card and who have chronic medical conditions are particularly vulnerable and unprotected because they have little discretionary disposable income. They are concerned about the impact the cost of medication has on their weekly budget rather than the annual costs of their medication. An illness can throw them into financial difficulty for many months after recovery, or they can decide not to seek medical help at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> For many consumers, the costs of pharmaceuticals are already a considerable barrier to access to appropriate and efficient health care and quality use of medicine when they face these unexpected out-of-pocket expenses. This situation is already forcing many people in our communities to treat their health care as an option rather than as a basic necessity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the budget portfolio statement for the Department of Health and Family Services states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Saving will accrue from concessional patients meeting a higher proportion of the total cost of pharmaceutical benefits scheme drugs plus a disincentive from the price increase to reduce unnecessary drug use.</PARA>
<PARA>The audacity of the underlying assumption that the disadvantaged in our community are consuming drugs like biscuits and that we can force them to reduce consumption through prices fails to recognise that the consumer does not, and should not, have the responsibility for determining what medications they will take. The same document makes the same spurious claim in its explanation about the increased co-payment for general patients. It states that an intended impact is to create a `disincentive arising from the increased cost for the acquisition of unnecessary scripts'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> If the government believes there is a problem with oversupply of scripts, then this should be addressed through the doctor and not through the patient. The reality is, how ever, that this bill is all about cost cutting and nothing about health protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regularly I speak to the people in the Throsby electorate on these issues and regularly I am horrified by the decisions that families are being forced to make on their health. Often I am told that people delay going to doctors for unreasonable amounts of time because co-payments are a problem. People tell me about hunting around the house, in kids' money boxes and so forth, to find enough money to buy the medicines prescribed. Often when families are sick, such as during flu outbreaks, the parents will buy their children's medications and not their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The results of these sorts of decisions have far-reaching impacts on the education performance of children, on the work productiveness of parents, on the spread of illness and, not least, on the quality of life for these families. Indeed, the $488 million estimated to be saved by these measures will be more than lost in the impacts outlined. This is a measure that takes the easy, visible saving and ignores the far more significant and insidious cost to our society and economy in the long run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not apologise for portraying a grim and dramatic picture tonight on this issue, because the increases that are outlined in this bill will cause a grim and dramatic decrease in the health and wellbeing of many people. I can well believe that this would be incomprehensible to the share-endowed people on the government benches. I can well believe that the idea of having to scrape together small change to buy medicines would be incomprehensible to them. I can also well believe that making decisions about buying, sharing or doing without medicines is incomprehensible for them. They are, after all, seriously preoccupied with determining the best time to sell hundreds of thousands of dollars of shares. I can well believe all of this. It makes the petty, mean-minded and arrogant decisions of this bill all the more shameful for this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Several weeks ago I said in this House that it was interesting to hear government members, especially new government members, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6039"> come into this chamber and try to defend the indefensible. This could have been one of the most indefensible actions in the budget program. The honourable member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash)&mdash;a new member&mdash;said in her speech during the appropriation debate and has said many times in her electorate that no-one is disadvantaged by this budget. I am waiting until the pensioners from Kiama, the pensioners from Nowra and the pensioners from around the bay beat their way into the honourable member for Gilmore's office and explain to her how they are very much disadvantaged by these government measures with the additional payments that they will have to make. I guess the honourable member for Gilmore will make her usual response and accuse me and other opposition members of scaremongering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of those on the other side of the House who are smugly relying on keeping the mainstream middle income earners on side to protect their seats will want to start feeling some anxiety about this bill also. Average income earners are no more happy about these proposals than the lower income earners. It was pointed out to me by a Throsby family on a reasonably comfortable income&mdash;I have a few of those in my electorate&mdash;that these changes, while not causing them the agonising choices facing low income families and pensioners, will certainly impact on them and cause resentment against this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A parent who visits a doctor with a child can reasonably expect now to be close to $50 out of pocket after the experience. Firstly, they face the Medicare co-payment at the doctor's surgery. Most commonly, they receive at least two scripts for a sick child and, therefore, face paying another $40 minimum at the chemist. This is a direct out-of-pocket increase of $5.20 for this family. I hope that, each time they reach into their pockets to pay it, they remember the lies and the empty promises that the government made about `looking after' mainstream Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a party that campaigned on being family friendly, this government has the strangest idea of friendliness that I have ever observed. Forcing families, and especially the most vulnerable on low incomes or income <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support, to make the sorts of decisions that this bill will force them into is reprehensible and shows the family friendly promises for the shallow and meaningless tripe that they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government should drop the changes proposed in this bill immediately. It is completely unacceptable to make budget savings based on decreasing support for families and pensioners in ensuring their health and wellbeing. Health is not an area where decisions are made purely as a goods or service purchaser where a decision to forgo the purchase is a viable option. If this government, in its remoteness from the real lives of average Australians, pursues this type of agenda on health then it has proven itself the enemy of families throughout Australia. This will not be forgotten by those families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In conclusion, as the member for Bradfield is so keen about the Mr and Mrs Wright that he met on the streets of Penrith when he was campaigning, I would invite him to come with me and address the Dapto senior citizens who meet on the last Thursday of the month&mdash;if he does not want to come to Dapto then come to the Oak Flats senior citizens, the Albion Park senior citizens, the Warilla senior citizens or the Shellharbour senior citizens&mdash;and explain to them why they are going to have to pay this extra money and see if he gets the same reception. That is, if the pensioners there turn cartwheels up and down Wentworth Street, Port Kembla, because they enjoy having to pay extra money. I do not know if the pensioners were turning cartwheels up and down the main street of Penrith, but he indicated that they were quite happy to pay that extra amount to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Bradfield did not name them, but I suspect they are Mr and Mrs Wright. However, I can assure him that he will not find a Mr and Mrs Wright in my electorate. He will find very concerned pensioners. They are very concerned about where they are going to find the funds to meet the impost of this cruel and heartless government and, when they are ill, what part of their meagre allowances they will have to go without to meet this increased cost.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposed changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme outlined in the budget represent yet another attack on the living standards of the most vulnerable in our community. In this case it is the elderly and the sick. In the past, they have been the major beneficiaries of this scheme. As a result of this bill, they will be paying more for essential medicines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to remember the speech the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave to ACOSS last year when he promised that the coalition would maintain the real value of pensions and other social security benefits. This bill breaks that promise. This bill proposes to increase the co&hyphen;payment for all health care cardholders from $2.70 to $3.20 per prescription. It is important to note that it is the first time since 1990&hyphen;91 that co-payments have been increased by more than the CPI adjustment. This represents an increase in 1995-96 of 18.5 per cent for concession cardholders. At the same time, it raises the safety net from $140 to $166 so that all cardholders will be forced to spend $26 more before they are offered the protection of the safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to outline, as other speakers have, how this will impact on local people. A constituent of mine wrote to me saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My husband &amp; I are both "full" aged pensioners, my husband is not a "well" man &amp; has been constantly in need of medical attention of recent years, he is in hospital at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have a brother&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in a particular hostel in my electorate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it costs 85% of his Pension to keep him there, he has no assets, apart from 3 thousand Dollars $3,000, which has been set aside for his Funeral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now the problem I have is this, his medication costs $78:66 this month &amp; fluctuates between that &amp; $40 &amp; $50, he requires incontinent pads which I have to find, at great cost &amp; then there are his clothes to provide. We are beginning to find, that as his needs are increasing, that we cannot carry the financial burden &amp; it is a burden I can tell you. I shudder to think of the increase, again, when the cost of Prescriptions rise.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the sorts of letters that regularly come into our electorate offices. It is a complete misrepresentation for those on the other side to say that this bill will have no impact <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the community. As my constituent makes very clear, it will have a very serious impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the previous speaker, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), I too have had a number of meetings with pensioners. I have had a meeting at the northern end of my electorate at Judge Book Retirement Village in Eltham and at the West Heidelberg Community Health Centre. One of the major concerns raised at those meetings is the increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals. Those elderly people are well aware that their lives are going to be made much worse by this increase in the price of pharmaceuticals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case that both concessional and general patients will be adversely affected by changes designed to round up rather than round down this co&hyphen;payment. Those of us who have had a close look at the budget can see that these measures effectively increase the co-payment by $56 million. That is how much the government expects to raise by rounding up rather than rounding down the price. This is a sneaky way of going about the fee increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rationale for this measure is said to be that it will provide an incentive for patients to reduce unnecessary drug use. What I would like to know is: on what basis does the government make this claim? How can it know that pensioners and others are reducing only unnecessary medication? Is it not more reasonable to suppose that they will reduce their purchases of pharmaceuticals and that they find it very difficult to judge what are essential and what are non&hyphen;essential pharmaceuticals? It will mean a direct attack on the health standards of vulnerable Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A particularly worrying aspect of this proposal&mdash;and one of the main reasons we oppose this increase&mdash;is that it fails to increase the pharmaceutical allowance which has been paid by the Department of Social Security to pensioners and some other beneficiaries to offset the cost of pharmaceuticals. In the past, increases in this co&hyphen;payment have always been accompanied by increases in the pharmaceutical allowance. This change, which is not accompanied by an increase in the pharmaceutical allowance, will have damaging <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6041"> consequences for pensioners and other cardholders. It is effectively a cut in entitlement and, once again, yet another breach of the coalition's pre&hyphen;election promise to retain the value of all benefits and entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor guaranteed that pensioners did not have to pay more for prescriptions by ensuring that the pharmaceutical allowance went up with the price of prescriptions. All that has once again changed. This Liberal government is happy to see pensioners pay more for medicines. That is the bottom line in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Residents of nursing homes and hostels, who are high users of pharmaceutical benefit scheme drugs, are especially concerned about the increase in the co-payment and the failure to increase the pharmaceutical allowance. This increase in the price of drugs comes on top of the other things this government has done to older people such as the increase in the daily fee for residents and the introduction of entry fees for nursing home patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with other people holding concession cards, they are also faced with significant costs for dental treatment following the government's decision to abolish the Commonwealth dental care program. We saw today the government's intransigence on this issue during the debate on the matter of public importance when the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) said that free dental care is an indulgence. I do not think there is one pensioner in my electorate who thinks that free dental care is anything other than a necessity because otherwise they will be paying up to $180 just for a filling, which is absolutely outside the capacity of all pensioners. This government might think that free dental care and subsidised prescriptions are indulgences but what the community knows is that they are a necessity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The adverse impact of these changes is not just restricted to people holding concession cards. Families will also suffer. Everyone who is not a concession cardholder will pay $20 for each prescription, an increase of $2.60 or&mdash;and let us look at the percentage again&mdash;14.9 per cent, a heck of a lot higher than the consumer price index. This means that any additional funds received by families through the government's tax package which survived <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the child&hyphen;care increase and the increased HECS payments will be swallowed up by this increased co&hyphen;payment for pharmaceuticals. It certainly makes an absolute mockery of the government's commitment to families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what happens to a family with two children when they go to the doctor. We all know that when children get sick they tend to get sick at the same time. We know what that will mean to those families. Just for one script for each of the children that will mean $40 at the chemist. The family tax initiative for this family is only $7.70 a fortnight for each dependent child. One&hyphen;third of this is gone just from the increase in the price of essential medicines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From this measure alone we are seeing the eating away of this family tax initiative, not to mention all the other cost increases to families that are contained in this budget. As the Australian Council of Social Service said, the impact of this pharmaceutical co&hyphen;payment will be particularly severe for people on low incomes. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will cause increased hardship and may lead to worse health outcomes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the critical issue&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for many low income individuals and families who already experience great financial strain in buying the pharmaceuticals they need. Some chronically ill people and low income families (especially those with . . . children) who do not have concessional status find it very difficult to meet out of pocket expenses before reaching the safety net threshold.</PARA>
<PARA>The rationale for this measure, as I said before, is said to be that it will decrease the number of scripts that people buy&mdash;the government's estimate is by two per cent in the first year. There is no attempt to differentiate between necessary and unnecessary scripts. Perhaps the government believes that only those who hold concession cards use unnecessary prescriptions because, as far as those who don't hold concession cards are concerned, it will only decrease the script volumes overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget provisions suggest that the decrease in the use of pharmaceuticals will not be sustained beyond 1998&hyphen;99. That leads me to think that the government believes the additional co&hyphen;payment, while increasing costs <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6042"> to consumers, will have no impact on overall demand for pharmaceuticals in the longer term. Does it mean, as I would suspect the government is thinking, that it might have to put up the price again in that time? Or, as suggested by some other commentators such as Professor Stephen Leeder, is what we are seeing that co&hyphen;payments have now risen to the point where they exceed in some cases the across&hyphen;the&hyphen;counter price of the same product in the United States? This is how silly it has got: we are now charging co&hyphen;payments for drugs in Australia that are above the across&hyphen;the&hyphen;counter price in other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any realistic attempt to control pharmaceutical expenditure must look at both supply and demand, especially at the supply of high cost drugs which have increasingly come within the ambit of the scheme. What these budget measures do is look only at demand. They are thus, in my view, doomed to fail in the overall objective of trying to bring control to the overall cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. These measures are unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that we intend to support the budget measure designed to deny access to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme subsidies to visitors to Australia from countries which do not have reciprocal health care arrangements. I have to say it is similar to a proposal made by the former government in 1991, but that proposal was withdrawn after opposition from the Privacy Commissioner, the Pharmacy Guild and other consumer bodies. Their opposition was based on the threat to privacy of individual patients resulting from the proposal to link pharmacists by computer to the Health Insurance Commission so that they could verify eligibility of people seeking prescriptions through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not clear from the budget how the government intends to deal with this issue. While we note that the government has said it will hold discussions with the Pharmacy Guild, what we would like to see is satisfactory arrangements made to safeguard patient privacy&mdash;and only in those circumstances can the government rely on our support for this measure. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate once again that we are strongly opposed to the other measures in this bill because they are unfair, because they are yet more broken promises of this government and because what these measures show is that the government does not understand that access to necessary health services is a key responsibility of government. We see in the decision to abolish the dental program and in the way the government has completely changed the philosophy about access to nursing homes, by increasing fees and requiring up&hyphen;front fees before you get into a nursing home, that the whole notion of access to essential health services on the basis of need is out the window. These decisions are wrong and we will oppose them because necessary health care is something we as Australians should be proud to provide for each other as a community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With so many of the budget measures that have come before this place, I have been moved to say that the motto has been, `If you can't pay, you miss out.' The mean-spirited changes that the budget has in store for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme co-payment extend that motto to, `If you pay already, you will pay more.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with all these budget related measures, it is easy to pick the winners and losers under the Howard government. The big losers in this case are families and concession cardholders. The changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme attack some of the most disadvantaged in the community. An increase in the maximum patient contribution for general patients from $17.40 to a maximum of $20 means that ordinary families will suffer every time they have to go to the pharmacy. Those with small children will be aware that hardly a week goes by without visits to the doctor and the pharmacy and the expense that can result from these. The government's proposals for an increase in the co-payment slug these families even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The co-payment increase really makes a complete mockery of the government's rhetoric about the family tax initiative. It is so typical of this government that, while it is talking about easing the burden on families through tax incentives, it wants to slug them harder with the increased PBS charges. What <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6043"> it gives with one hand it snatches back with the other&mdash;and then some more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most insidious aspect of the increase of the co-payment is its effect on pensioners and other concession cardholders. Pensioners will be required to pay an extra 50c per prescription. This represents a clear breach of the coalition's promise both before and since the election. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised that the real value of all pension benefits and other entitlements for low income earners would be maintained. Yet the increase from $2.70 to $3.20 in the co-payment for pensioners is not offset by any corresponding increase in the pension. The real value is not maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time since the co-payment was introduced for pensioners and concession cardholders, the important link between the pension and the PBS co-payment is broken. Furthermore, the Prime Minister promised that one group in the community that is not going to be hurt is the most vulnerable. How else, other than hurting the most vulnerable, is one to describe taking an extra $100 million per year from health cardholders? It is a direct assault on them. The budget changes to the PBS co-payment are combined with other attacks on the vulnerable in the health portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget sees the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program, the subject of the MPI debate earlier today, and the massive slashing of funds to public hospitals to fund the coalition's private health insurance tax break. Both of these cuts breach pre-election undertakings and are a betrayal of the vulnerable that the Prime Minister promised to protect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pharmaceutical benefits scheme not only protects the most disadvantaged in our society but also allows access to medicines for all Australians. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme was established in 1950 to provide reliable and affordable access to medicines for the Australian community. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme system accounts for 78 per cent of total prescription drug sales in Australia. There are currently 1,600 products and 537 pharmaceutical substances listed on the PBS.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the introduction of a co-payment in 1960, the nature of the PBS has not changed, indicating its overwhelming success. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme has been the subject of numerous inquiries and reports as well as the focus of much attention from economic rationalists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year there were reports that the government is considering transferring the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to the states. This would have been an absolute disaster for consumers and the pharmaceutical industry alike. It is undoubtedly a function of the Commonwealth to ensure that all Australians have access to affordable medicines. That function is simply too vital to be sacrificed at the altar of transfer of responsibilities to the states. If there was a perceived problem of cost shifting between the state-run hospital system and the PBS, there are other ways of dealing with that without handing over the function holus&hyphen;bolus to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the Industry Commission report into the pharmaceutical industry, which was released in May, had to admit that `the welfare of the community is enhanced by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme'. However, that important recognition of the PBS did not stop the Industry Commission launching into its usual rhetoric. The Industry Commission report describes the PBS as an `impediment to industry growth'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes one wonders which planet some of these Industry Commission boffins live on. It views a system which allows access to drugs that the vast majority of Australians just simply could not afford as an impediment to industry growth. If that is the case, why are the drug manufacturers so keen to obtain PBS listings for their products? The drug manufacturers realise that PBS listing allows consumers to have their product when the vast majority of them could never afford it at full prices. The Industry Commission report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Low prices, volume constraints and listing delays under the PBS play a significant part in influencing company investment decisions. However, there is no clear cut case for ongoing financial intervention through a factor&hyphen;F type scheme. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6044"> </PARA>
<PARA>One would have thought that the success of the factor F scheme for the pharmaceutical industry in Australia speaks for itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the inception of the factor F scheme in 1988, the Commonwealth has allocated about $1 billion in funding. For that investment in the pharmaceutical industry, companies have committed $1.9 billion in export added value, $1.9 billion in domestic added value, $538 million in R&amp;D expenditure and about $604 million in investment expenditure. In fact, in commenting on the Industry Commission report, the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is vital that a Factor (f) type scheme be established as soon as possible to provide increased certainty for industry planning post&hyphen;1999.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite these figures that indicate the success of the factor F scheme, the Industry Commission seems oblivious to this same success. These figures are the best examples possible for the case for continuing intervention. I urge the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) to consider the scheme's success, as the factor F scheme is scheduled to expire in the middle of 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other inconsistencies in the Industry Commission's report. It states that the low prices are an impediment to industry growth, yet the factor F scheme is designed to specifically deal with this. The report complains that constantly increasing health costs are a problem for the Commonwealth, yet advocates higher prices for drugs, which would presumably eat up more of the health budget. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme did not escape the attention of the National Commission of Audit. The report recommends that&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth should contain growth in MBS and PBS outlays by adopting measures to reduce unnecessary use.</PARA>
<PARA>This is precisely what was supposed to happen and does occur as a result of co&hyphen;payments. A study conducted in 1991 investigating the relationship between the use and price of drugs showed that the increase in the co&hyphen;payment from $5 to $10 in 1987 reduced demand by 27 per cent for general patients. The Department of Health and Family Services states in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Portfolio Budget Statements</EMPHASIS> <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that part of the savings will result from the `disincentive from the price increase to reduce unnecessary drug use'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But at some point the increase in the co&hyphen;payment could be expected to go beyond simply eliminating unnecessary drug use. There is a danger that increases in co&hyphen;payments will drive demand down below the appropriate level of prescriptions and dispensations. People often make the decision to fill their prescriptions based on the capacity to pay, not just on whether they require the medicine. Despite the safety net provisions, we have to understand that in a family's weekly or fortnightly budget these are considerations that have to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The upshot of this scenario is that there is a possibility that necessary prescriptions will not be filled;  that once they are prescribed by the doctor, a person would not go to the chemist to have them dispensed because of continually increasing co&hyphen;payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Commission of Audit report criticises the open&hyphen;ended nature of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme as opposed to capping of services in other health areas. What would it suggest as a viable alternative? Limiting the number of times people are allowed to go to the pharmacy? The tone of the whole section of the National Commission of Audit report on health services suggests that the report's authors think people go to the doctor or get medicine as a leisure activity and should pay for it accordingly. It fails to realise that people need health services because they are ill, not because they want them. The report talks of `using price to ration access to health care', as if people choose when they get sick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most worrying sign from the National Commission of Audit report is that one of its alternative approaches for reform is to fully devolve all health funding to the states, including the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This insidious recommendation must be vigorously opposed. Both the Industry Commission report and the National Commission of Audit report are more concerned with an ideology and attempting to implement that ideology than with the issues of people's health. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6045">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What must be realised is that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is a scheme that requires the efforts of a number of people. It requires the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry. Talking about the pharmaceutical industry, I have to emphasise the need for a domestic Australian pharmaceutical industry. Some of the things that have been developed within medical research and development have been by renowned Australian scientists and medical specialists. A number of those developments have been lost to Australia because of our inability to develop them. As the figures that I cited earlier in my speech indicated, a report by a predecessor to the Industry Commission about the pharmaceutical industry meant that the previous government put in place the factor F scheme. It is a scheme which has been very successful because it links the pharmaceutical industry with the PBS. The PBS is a cooperative effort between medical professionals, doctors, pharmacy professionals and, importantly, the consumer, the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision by the previous government to increase co&hyphen;payments for general payments and introduce them for pensioners and health care cardholders was to provide an important price signal. But that price signal was not just for the consumer's benefit. The price signal was also to give added weight to the professional judgment that was to be made&mdash;predominantly by the prescriber&mdash;when dealing with a patient. Because the co&hyphen;payment was giving a price signal, alternative courses of treatment were able to be suggested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier in the debate the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) made a contribution. For a newcomer, he quite easily got into the rhetoric of the occasion and toed the party line. He led with all the shibboleths about the black hole which the government inherited and all those sorts of things. But I have to say in fairness to him that later, when he spoke more as a medical professional, he acknowledged the efforts of the previous government in trying to deal with some of the issues of over&hyphen;prescribing and over&hyphen;dispensing of the PBS. I give him credit for acknowledging those efforts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He acknowledged that, through the divisions of general practice, a number of innovative ideas have been looked at. Importantly, he acknowledged the efforts of coordination treatment regimes in reducing the necessity to prescribe drugs&mdash;something which has been lost in this mean&hyphen;spirited budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I have emphasised the importance of the price signal, that was not the only measure to rationalise the use of prescription drugs. Other efforts had to be made to ensure that all the professionals involved, not only the doctors but the pharmacists in their professional role of dispensing drugs, were encouraged to spend more time with the consumer&hyphen;patient to ensure that the consumer had available the proper necessary information to understand the range of alternatives available in the treatment of their ailment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Bradfield said, non&hyphen;drug interventions can range from physiotherapy, change of lifestyle to counselling&mdash;all sorts of activities. Traditionally, unabated, the pharmaceutical benefit scheme was seen as something that just rolled along, making drugs available and there was an expectation that a drug intervention was the way that all illnesses might be treated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I thought it was very interesting that the response of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, straight after the budget, to the increased co&hyphen;payment under the heading, `Pensioners to bear brunt of increased co&hyphen;payments', called upon the government to assist the pharmacy profession to explain to pensioners the nature of the increased co&hyphen;payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the medical and pharmacy professions understand that they can play a role in improving the health outcomes for people, which is what we should emphasise and underscore because that is the most important thing, and at the same time reduce the outlays under the PBS&mdash;not for the sake of satisfying some bean counters in Treasury or Finance and reducing outlays but because it is in the best interests of the consumer&hyphen;patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hate to think that this bowing to the economic rationalist model that is often presented in the bureaucracy and welcomed with open arms by the present government is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6046"> such that things are always seen in dollars and cents. Often we get too involved in these debates without recognising that one of the things we should underscore is the predominant reason for the PBS, that is, to get the best health outcome from our overall health system and not just the pharmaceutical aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with my colleagues in the opposition in indicating my opposition to the aspects outlined by the shadow minister and other speakers on this bill. It is disappointing that some of those indications by the Prime Minister in the run&hyphen;up to the election have been revealed as something he believes are not core and germane to the overall thrust of what the government is trying to achieve. It sends a wrong signal to everybody to pick on, under the PBS scheme, the people who are most disadvantaged.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the government says, `That is an increase of only 50c in the contribution. It's really not big potatoes at all. Who could really complain about that?', the reality is that over the period covered by this legislation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $380 million will be ripped from the sick and their families across this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The co&hyphen;payment for people who do not have access to the concessional card goes from $17.40 to $20. It also increases the general patient charge from $2.70 to $3.20. Again the government says, `Who could really complain about an increase of 50c?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you have only $1 left, 50c is half of it. It is all a matter of the perspective of the person and the family facing this expense. It is very easy for politicians on the other side to rail in support of this kind of legislation on the basis that it is not really very much as a unit charge increase. When children in a family are sick over the course of a week, the number of prescriptions required&mdash;the outlays involved&mdash;is of considerable importance to the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is really about families. This government and some of the newer members&mdash;they have not yet learnt the reality of their leadership; that is coming for them; there is a very rude shock ahead of them&mdash;are gung&hyphen;ho in putting down families. They mouth the language about families, they repeat all the code words, but this is where it matters. These are the items and expenditures that bear upon the standard of living of families and the hardship that can be created for families. It is only 50c, but it is another $180 million being stripped from sick families and sick individuals over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, the bill changes the indexation arrangements for the co&hyphen;payments and the general safety net threshold. Previously the rounding rules were rounded down to the nearest 10c. Now the rounding can be either up or down to the nearest 10c.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You say, again, `That doesn't seem to matter much at the moment'&mdash;until you look at the numbers and you find that the effect of that is to rip another $56 million from sick families over the next four years. Add another $56 million to the $488 million over four years and you have $544 million&mdash;more than half a billion dollars being stripped from families with sick loved ones over the course of the next few years! It is a massive impact upon people. But then we have come to expect from the leaders of this government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6047"> that the promises they make in opposition are not the actions they pursue in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to put things into perspective, using the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS>. I am not going to show it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker; I will read it to you. On Friday 25 May 1979, the headline on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS> is `Lies, Lies, Lies!' There is a photograph beside the headline, where it is stated, `Federal Treasurer, Mr Howard, last night drew wide criticism throughout Australia with his mini&hyphen;budget.' Without going into all the detail of the article, the relevant opening paragraphs state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal Treasurer, Mr Howard, last night brought down a savage mini&hyphen;budget which broke two promises on personal income tax and announced big cuts in government expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will continue the income tax surcharge, suspend tax indexation and cut health benefits. The two government promises broken were the 1&half; per cent tax surcharge imposed in the last budget, `a temporary measure' that would expire at the end of this financial year and full tax indexation would apply from 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard said the government's decision not to fulfil its promises had been made necessary by the fact that they would have cost $1,100 million in personal tax collections in 1979&hyphen;1980.</PARA>

I identified the date and the year&mdash;it is all there. I will give him a copy if he likes. It is relevant and important to the other remarks I am leading <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into: the credibility and integrity of the leadership of this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No amount of fancy language or codespeak can disguise the fact that this government are on course to destroy Medicare as it existed on 2 March 1996. I assert that. I believe it and it is in accord with their past practice when previously in government. The government plan to close one&hyphen;third of all Medicare offices. When the Community and Public Sector Union on 8 August 1996 released the list of 84 offices slated for closure&mdash;the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has now come into the chamber&mdash;the minister did not deny it. In his press statement of 8 August, he simply said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government has made a commitment to ensuring that all Australians have fair and reasonable access to Medicare services either through Medicare offices or through pharmacies operating as Medicare agencies.</PARA>
<PARA>In my electorate, Belmont Medicare office is scheduled for closure. It is on that list. That list&mdash;the fact that it is there; there has not been any denial of it by the government&mdash;has caused outrage in my electorate. To date, I have presented to the parliament petitions from 1,105 men and women of my electorate objecting to the closure. They want their Medicare office maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The ridiculous situation is that five weeks prior to 8 August that office had just been relocated to the Belmont city centre and refurbished at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars, and is providing an excellent service. The campaign against closure of that office is led by local pharmacists and doctors who see the government's proposals to have Medicare agencies at selected pharmacies as impractical, expensive and smacking of patronage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6048"> When the refurbished Medicare office has just been opened and is providing an excellent service and the public are happy with its operation, who would want to close it? Only those from the Liberal and National parties. There would be no doubt that, far from being committed to the maintenance of Medicare as it existed and operated on 2 March 1996, this government is committed to its emasculation. This is a government that has always been in the pocket of the AMA and the health insur ance funds. The connections date back to the mid&hyphen;1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The executive director of the Health Insurance Association, Mr Russell Schneider, was formerly the press secretary to Prime Minister Fraser at the time when John Howard was Treasurer. As opposition leader, Malcolm Fraser promised to maintain Medibank, and then set about destroying it step by step by step. The result of that was that, over the seven years of the Fraser government, nine different health schemes were introduced, with each of them whittling away a little more of Medibank as it had been created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We turn to the statement made by the then opposition leader, John Howard, on 12 February 1996. He said, `Medicare will be retained in its entirety.' But we are seeing the whittling away of Medicare as it existed on 2 March 1996. The Minister for Health and Family Services is sitting at the table and listening to what I am saying. What we are looking at here, despite his best endeavours and whatever he has in mind, is the first step towards the dismantling of Medicare as it exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will move to the issue of having Medicare agencies in selected pharmacies. When talking with representatives who have been in touch with the guild, you find that pharmacists generally are extremely concerned about this. The information available seems to indicate that the affected areas will be isolated locations only. But what criteria will be followed? Which pharmacy will get the nod out of the five or six pharmacies in the particular shopping centre, area or suburb, and on what basis will that happen? On what basis can you justify closing down a cash payment service at a Medicare office that is already operating effectively and that is well appreciated by the community who use it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Medicare agencies are not cash payment agencies. What is being talked about here&mdash;and it is difficult for the pharmacies themselves to get this information&mdash;is the introduction of a new system. We will have a system whereby retirees will toddle into the pharmacy, fax their claim to a Medicare office and have a credit put onto their bank account. They can then use EFTPOS at a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> local supermarket to try to get the money back. Whatever it is, it is utterly impractical. The pharmacists know that, and they do not want a bar of it. Most importantly, what this system will do is reduce the availability of the cash payment service of Medicare. It is the first paring away of the service as we know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the Commonwealth dental health program. I cannot think of a health care program, next to Medicare, that was more campaigned for over a longer period of time by the community than the Commonwealth dental health program. That program directly benefits people in pain and people who are suffering. Dental diseases cause pain and discomfort and they have a high economic impact. The information provided for 1983 shows that more than a million days of work were lost because of dental conditions. For the same period, over three million days of limited activity were associated with oral disease and pain. Dental decay is the most costly diet related disease in Australia, with annual costs of dental treatment exceeding $1,500 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People campaigned for years and years to have that program implemented. It came in initially for a three-year period and it was funded for that period, which is common practice in legislation and appropriations. The lame excuse trotted out by this government when axing that program was for them to say, `The previous government didn't fund it. It hadn't proposed to fund it before 30 June past.' The previous government legislated it for three years, which is standard practice across a range of programs&mdash;be they one year, two years or whatever. They are matters that one reviews as they come up. There is no doubt that, had our government continued, the program would have been continued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I find particularly offensive is the statement made by the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), but I can understand what he said coming from an electorate like Bradfield. He said, `Free dental care is an indulgence.' Say that to retirees in my electorate. Say that to the families I have in my electorate on low incomes. And this comes from a government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6049"> that talks about battling families. What hypocrisy!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this really says in a number of ways is that government members&mdash;not the leadership of the government, because they know what they are doing, but the troops&mdash;do not really understand what battling families have to suffer and what they have to cope with. If they did, government members would not make statements of that kind. If they were clever, they would not have abolished the program; they would have maybe had some winding down of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to stress the importance of the program. It has been of enormous benefit to constituents in my electorate and to the half million people over the past three years who have availed themselves of its benefits. It is a program that was greatly needed, is still greatly needed and ought to be re-established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the other matter that is coming through from the budget into these bills&mdash;that is, the cut in funding for public hospitals. One cannot talk about pharmaceutical benefits and changes to the payments made by purchasers of pharmaceuticals and by patients without referring to the need for and funding of public hospitals. Again, we see the same system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said in my earlier remarks that this government was in the pockets of the AMA. Many members of the AMA are proprietors of private hospitals. Many members of the AMA quite clearly have conflicts of interest in their relationships with private hospitals and in their dealings with patients. There is not a full disclosure of those relationships to patients at the time of treatment or the scheduling of treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see from this government&mdash;the government that is in the pockets of the AMA and the private health insurance funds&mdash;is any measure to reduce the standard of service at public hospitals. The loss of the $800 million that is being ripped out of the public hospital system over the next four years will have severe and damaging effects on the standard and availability of services provided by the public hospitals. Who suffers? Who goes on the end of the queue? The poorer people. Usually those most in need.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So often, it is the poorer people who have the greater dietary problems, as we have seen in the figures in relation to dental health care. They are the people who get the worse kind of service. Who has to wait longer? They have to wait longer, because they do not have the resources to be able to avail themselves of the care of private hospitals. This government has thrown some $600 million at trying to get a 1&half; per cent increase in the membership of private health funds. That $600 million is at the expense of the public health system, from which $800 million has been taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The equivalent of that $800 million cut in funding for public hospitals is the closure of two major teaching hospitals, such as the John Hunter or the Prince Alfred. It is the equivalent of closing down 1,000 hospital beds. The government proclaims its concern for battling families but denies those most in need dental care and the availability of hospital beds when they are sick. What hypocrisy. That mock concern will be seen through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government can be cock&hyphen;a&hyphen;hoop, as they are at the moment, with that exploded backbench over there singing their praises&mdash;they are so joyous to be down here&mdash;but I have told them before that they have been gravely deceived by their leadership and they will get the real news a bit further down the track. It is the history of this government. Its leadership is the same. It is the same John Howard. I am not going to show you this front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS> of 25 May 1979. I will lend it to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson). It is the same leadership, the same policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Prime Minister: I am sorry, Prime Minister, you cannot turn the clock back to the 1950s. You cannot go back to the single income, two children family with mother staying at home. Young Australian women have moved on. They want better than you are trying to turn them back to. The clock will not go back to people surging into private health insurance funds. What they want is a decent health system like Medicare that assures them of the standard of care they need, dependent upon their state of health, not dependent on the state of their pocket.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6050">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government can take no joy or satisfaction from the legislation before us. It is legislation that has been callously and ruthlessly designed. It is very clear in the mind of the government that it will hurt people who need help most.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is critical that we look at why we are debating the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill and these amendments. These are not health measures; they are budget measures. They did not arrive in the parliament to give us a better health system. They are primarily here because they provide substantial `savings' in the budget. In other words, those people affected by it are not being affected to their benefit. They are being seen as people who can contribute money to government revenues. Many of them are not taxpayers but beneficiaries. In fact, the vast bulk of them are either pensioners or people with health care cards. In this new day and age they are seen as being appropriate targets for revenue raising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we cast our minds back to the March election, we can recall the campaigning and the rhetoric and the comments that were being made by the media, along with the questions being asked of us as candidates. The fact was that there was not an economic crisis at that time. No-one said, `The country is in a crisis requiring diabolical, massive measures.' That proposition was never raised, discussed or considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are, six months later, in a crisis. How did we get here? The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) spent the last six months telling everybody what a crisis we are in. So this budget was developed to solve this fabricated crisis. However, having started that tap running&mdash;having started the crisis mentality&mdash;they are having trouble turning it off. One almost detects a note of anger in the government that people will not do what they are told and be confident again. Having spent six months telling them how bad things have been, the government now want to say that that was all a bit exaggerated. They have created a crisis by their rhetoric. Who are they conscripting to help? The people they promised they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would protect, the people they said they would support&mdash;the unemployed, the aged, the beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are at a point in time which I think will prove to be important in this nation's history. There is a lot of deja vu about it&mdash;Medibank, Medicare, the promises, the breaking of promises. But there is something even more striking. I think the current Prime Minister&mdash;who built his reputation supposedly on his economic, budgetary and treasury experiences&mdash;will go down in history as being similar to another Treasurer. I think he will become known as the Billy McMahon of the 1990s. He supposedly understood the Australian economy very well but never really did. He could never make the transition; he never grew up. He was fixed in a time warp 40 years ago. What we are seeing now is very reminiscent of the early 1970s, with a touch of the 1975s as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One might think that perhaps I was exaggerating some of these remarks in relation to what this government promised. Let us go back to the five or six kilograms of documents that were released almost in a matter of days during the election campaign. The document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Security for Older Australians</EMPHASIS> states that the coalition will `maintain the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and current pension and senior concessionary pharmaceuticals'. That is not something vague, obscure or convoluted; it is a very clear statement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Healthy Future</EMPHASIS>, another document of some physical weight&mdash;I am not sure about its weight in terms of reliability as a guide to this government's thinking&mdash;states on page 8:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concessional eligibility for the dispensing of PBS pharmaceuticals, especially for pensioners and health card holders, will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>If you were a pensioner before the March election and had that put to you, you would feel comfortable and relaxed about it. You would feel quite comfortable about a change of government. But that was deceitful. That was never intended. That was never planned. Those documents were always fraudulent, in motive and in application because, within days of that election, all the rhetoric had <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6051"> changed and all the ground rules had changed and we saw the crisis being fabricated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might think that 50c a prescription is not that much for pensioners to suffer&mdash;and it is saving $323 million. But link it with the abolition of the earnings averaging scheme, which allowed a pensioner to earn up to $1,000 a year without losing their pension. Prior to that scheme, often referred to as the `Santa Claus scheme', people who worked for a couple of weeks, say, at Christmas time, lost part of their pension. Under the earnings averaging scheme that did not happen; they did not lose their pension for that fortnight or three weeks work. But that scheme is going for a saving of $&frac14; million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the nursing home proposal. Up&hyphen;front fees for nursing homes are a form of death tax; no doubt about it. The Baptist organisation in New South Wales has pointed out that 40 per cent of the people who come into their homes do not last longer than six months. How does the up&hyphen;front fees scheme work then? The government's sums do not add up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ask departmental staff how this scheme will function. No&hyphen;one knows. To talk about a $26,000 up&hyphen;front fee is nonsense. This up&hyphen;front fees scheme will happen, if the Senate approves, but the fee will not be $26,000; more like $100,000. For those pensioners who have to come up with $100,000, life will be awfully difficult. Unless your family can find the money, it will be very hard to get into a nursing home in the years ahead. The idea that somehow nursing homes will be upgraded is obviously fraudulent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people on pensions who are in public housing at the moment are going through an enormous amount of anxiety over what is going to happen. They have heard about market rents and some form of rent assistance. But for those living in inner&hyphen;city Sydney, where market rents are very high, quite frankly, no&hyphen;one believes that the government will limit their contribution to 25 per cent. Even if they do, how will the buildings be maintained? People living in public housing, either on pensions or benefits, have had months of uncertainty, as have people who have been waiting for a place for years and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are close to getting one. All their security will evaporate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a number of times today about the axing of the Commonwealth dental scheme, one of the most humane schemes we had. Constituent after constituent has contacted me, disturbed and upset, because they were hoping for access to dental services which they now will not get&mdash;and I am not talking just about pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To top it all off, to solve the supposed budget problem&mdash;we know it is not that at all; it is ideology&mdash;we are looking at the transfer to state governments of a great number of Commonwealth programs, such as home and community care, residential aged care, and child care&mdash;programs right across the board. This is a government which is supposed to be governing for all of us, but how do they govern? They give all their responsibilities away to someone else, to the states. But if the states could do it happily and well, how come we are doing it now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has always been the gap filler. It has always filled the gaps in community infrastructure. That has been its function along with setting the standards. We are seeing a transfer back to the states of eight or nine different programs, perhaps even more because some states have quite large regional variations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people who, back in March, listened to the then opposition and took some notice of them have cause to feel concern. I am aware of all the polls and all the opinions around the place but of all the budgets I have been through since 1983 I have had more complaints, more letters, more constituents visiting my office and ringing me up than ever before about this one&mdash;and by a lot. As people start to find out how this budget is affecting them, they are not seeing it as fair, they are seeing it as vindictive because, in the main, these people cannot afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well to talk about sharing the burden. That is a great concept, as long as the people who are sharing it can actually carry it. These people do not have access to disposable income. They do not have lots of money to spare. The government has this idea that they should share the pain. But what for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6052"> people on higher incomes would be quite minor pain, for these people would be massive. That is not sharing the burden at all; it is totally disproportionate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the social security legislation before the House last week&mdash;a $1.2 billion saving from social security beneficiaries. That is a massive share. In the legislation before us, from people with pharmaceutical cards, the share is $323 million. These are large amounts coming from people with very small means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any fair society, sharing the burden should mean taking into account capacity to pay. This might be a fair go budget for some but for most of the people affected by this legislation and the social security legislation, there is nothing fair about it. It is quite discriminatory and it is vindictive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In theory, the 50c increase sounds quite small but we must remember that the recent indexed increase in the pension for the last six months was just over $1. Virtually half of the last increase per week is taken up per script. In other words, if these changes were to go through, a lot of pensioners would be worse off after the pension increase than they were before it. For many families, those on higher incomes, the extra $2.60 per script will not matter, but for a lot of working people in this country&mdash;the so&hyphen;called battlers that the government talks about so often&mdash;that is a significant amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is that very tricky little exercise, the rounding rule, which represents a saving of $56 million. It is immoral. It is farcical. The idea that you charge more than is actually paid! With modern computers, if you want to make the system cleaner and fairer, there is no need for rounding at all. Take the precise amount. If you cannot do that, at least give people the benefit of the doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea that you must round the cents with modern computer technology is farcical. It is a joke. The previous government was making a concession. By taking it back to the nearest whole dollar, you were giving people at least a concessional approach. What you were saying was that it was not really about money but more about other things. The rounding approach will save $56 million. Off whom? <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Off the people buying pharmaceuticals. Some of these people are wealthy, but very many of them are not. Health induced poverty is one of the nastiest things of all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these families will be the same families that were hurt by the child disability allowance that was reduced from a 12-month payment to a three-month payment from when first approved. The people being targeted all the way through seem to be the same groups of people&mdash;people who are disadvantaged and people who in many cases are powerless and isolated.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made the point earlier that, as these measures start to flow through, people will realise what the government is doing. The reason there is this perceived fairness out there is that people do not actually know what is going through this parliament. As they are finding out, I am getting more and more calls from more and more people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall some years ago, in the negotiations with the pharmacists, when the previous government was suggesting that they should consider people who may be using more than one doctor. The pharmacist was firstly concerned about the privacy question and secondly the red tape. I find it absolutely fascinating that pharmacists will now be required to check passports. What will happen to pharmacists who do not check passports? This measure is to ensure that scripts go only to Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We notice in the Liberal Party document that the point is made that pharmacists should be paid for services rendered and that the inducement of the Medicare agencies was a wonderful scam which never had a hope of coming off. Now we know that it will not. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6053"> Those pharmacists who were gulled by that perhaps should have known better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do those pharmacists feel now that they are being told they must check that people have either a Medicare card or an appropriate visa in their passport which entitles them to access pharmaceuticals? If the pharmacist does not check, what is the penalty? If they do check, who pays the cost? How are the records kept? How is it going to be administered? I wonder how those pharmacists in my electorate who overtly supported the present government are feeling about having to ask people to show a Medicare card or a passport. If a mistake is made, who is at fault and who is liable?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Using the pharmacist as an arm of Immigration and an arm of Foreign Affairs is a fascinating new concept. They are obviously being used to raise revenue off pensioners. The previous pharmaceutical scheme was revenue neutral to the pensioner. They paid what they received extra per week per script. It was revenue neutral to the pensioner's household. This measure is revenue raising. The pharmacists are now raising revenue from pensioners, but they are also going to be checking passports and visas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that will be a fascinating exercise to watch. I expect to be besieged by pharmacists who are looking for the rules that will apply if they make a mistake. Will they lose their licence? Minister, will they lose their licence if they don't check the photo? What will happen if the passport is somebody else's? Who punishes and how? Who is liable and what are the penalties? Will we see pharmacists in court for not adequately checking? What about if the Medicare card shown is not theirs? How are they sure that the person on the card is actually the person presenting the card? If they make a mistake, who punishes and how?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing here is a pharmacist being turned into an arm of Immigration, Foreign Affairs and the Health Insurance Commission. Will we see the requirement for a scanner to read the passport and to read the Medicare card? Is that the next step? One of the fears of pharmacists which they voiced some years ago was of being part of some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Big Brother scheme&mdash;a scheme which those opposite so loudly proclaimed was a great threat. Here it is: pharmacists will now be required to check Medicare cards and passports. This is great legislation! And what for? For a fabricated deficit&mdash;a deficit which we will see grow by many, many millions, if not billions, because of the cut in growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is not health legislation but budget legislation. It is not about improving the health system; it is about raising money. What is it raising money for? Because those opposite have created an ideological capacity to tell the Australian people that somehow we are in a crisis. Having spent six months doing that, and doing it very well, people now accept that there is a crisis. So they have stopped spending, stopped employing and stopped investing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of stopping the economy in its tracks since March, we are now seeing growth at at least half a per cent below the budget forecast, something like 1&half; to two per cent below last year's growth. That will create a massive deficit, bigger spending on unemployment and less revenue from taxation. In other words, all these measures will do more to hurt the budget than to help it. The more measures they bring in which frighten people and which reinforce the crisis, the more of a crisis they will have. I mentioned before the current Prime Minister will go down in history in my view as the Billy McMahon of the nineties. It will not take very long for people to see through the nonsense, the silliness and the fraudulence of this legislation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;That was fun. It is nice to know there are still a few true believers around. Let me make a few broad comments, and then I will seek to answer some specific queries of the shadow minister, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). I was interested by the comments of the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). It was great to know that towards the end of his speech he actually worked out that this was budget legislation. You bet it is, and I make no apology for it. It is budget legislation in an attempt to make the health system <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6054"> sustainable. The fact is that, unless the health system continues to evolve, it will not exist and you will have a crisis such as Canada, Germany and Holland are facing. They have to do drastic things. Unless you can meet the unsustainable growth in outlays that occur in a number of areas, you will find that eventually the crunch will come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have tried to avoid that. We have tried, with the pharmaceutical benefits system, to address an area that under the last four years of Labor doubled in cost. That is okay if you have a magic pudding, but eventually someone has to pay for it. We decided, this year, that rather than keep burdening debt on to future generations of Australians we would try to live within our means. I did not like having to do some of the things we did. The only thing I can think of that is worse is to leave Australia an unsustainable economic situation or leave Australia a health system that is not sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deficit, I have to say, having sat on the Expenditure Review Committee, is very real. I do not know if the member for Newcastle made a slip of the tongue, but in one sentence he said that we fabricated the deficit and in the next sentence he said that the deficit was going to grow. I would have thought that was reasonably internally inconsistent. The fact is it is very real. In fact, it turned out to be more than $8 billion. When it came in at the end of the last financial year it was $10.5 billion, but we thought that rather than complicate the message we would leave it at the figure we were given on 12 March. The fact is that it turned out to be worse than we said on 12 March&mdash;not better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It turned out that we had gone into the election with the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) saying, `Look, everything is fine. The budget is going to be in surplus.' I have been round long enough to remember the Prime Minister before 1993 saying, `You don't have to worry about deficit. It is going to whirr back into surplus.' These things are not real; these things do not happen. You were living in a fantasy land. The fact is we fixed up your mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The really interesting thing to me is the result in Lindsay, because we suffered two <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> months of your whingeing, your carping and your nitpicking. Just in case you did not get the message from the people of Lindsay, they dropped your primary vote by another five per cent. As long as you wish to keep carping, nitpicking and whingeing, I am delighted for you to do it because your primary vote will continue to go down and you will continue to be irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I will address the specific issues of the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill first. The honourable shadow minister asked me two questions. The first question was: do countries provide reciprocal health benefit arrangements and is it going to apply to diplomats in Australia? We intend to apply this as broadly as we possibly can. It clearly will apply to any country with which we have a reciprocal health arrangement. For countries with which we do not have a reciprocal health arrangement, my understanding is at the moment it will apply to them, but we are trying to expand the number of countries with whom we have a reciprocal health arrangement because that is in both their interest and ours&mdash;particularly for Australians travelling overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second question the shadow minister asked me was: will you give an assurance that the bureaucratic requirements for pharmacies will be kept to a minimum? Yes, I will. We are having productive and fairly cooperative at this stage discussions with the Pharmacy Guild, and it is hardly our desire to put further work on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are basically two issues in the bill that the opposition will be opposing. That is obviously their right, but let me just talk about them. The first is an increase in the co-payment. Again, this was done simply because of the rate of growth in the pharmaceutical benefits system, and it is pretty frightening. We are paying out about $2.6 billion in pharmaceutical benefits. That is substantially larger than the budget of the state of Tasmania. If not a single new drug comes onto the PBS in the next four years, it will go up 50 per cent in cost. Clearly there will be new drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best estimate, if we did nothing, is that in the next four years it will double in cost <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6055"> again, as has happened in the last four years. Unfortunately, $2.6 billion is real money. Unless we do something to address that rate of growth, it will simply gobble up every other area of my health budget, and that includes things like Aboriginal health, public health, diabetes and immunisation. In the end, a health budget is finite, and if you have a Medicare benefit system and a pharmaceutical benefits system that are out of control the capacity to do things in other areas is severely limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The average number of scripts that a concessional cardholder has is 17 a year. Therefore, the average number of scripts for people who are older concessional cardholders is 30 a year. I absolutely concede that the average concessional cardholder will be $8.50 a year worse off for that. For that extra $8.50 a year, they will get continuing access to the pharmaceutical benefits system, which is now vaguely under control in terms of cost. For the general cardholder, the average number of scripts is 1.6 a year. Going from $17.40 to $20, the average general PBS person who accesses it will be $4 a year worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The second major issue here is that of rounding. Rounding was devised by the previous government at a time when inflation was higher. If inflation is high, rounding works reasonably well and you can afford to round down. We are in a time of low inflation, and we hope that will exist for a substantially long time. In a time of low inflation, rounding down means effectively the script stays where it is forever and the intent of the initial legislation is not met. We are not rounding up all the time. We are simply saying it should be rounded up or down to the nearest 10c.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to be too picky but the $6 per script that the previous speaker mentioned does not exist; the rounding to the nearest dollar does not exist, it is the nearest 10c; and it is not the case that the chronically ill are going to pay more when we are leaving the safety net where it is. All that will happen for the general concession is that they will reach the safety net sooner and pay the same amount of money for the entire year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There were a couple of other comments that I should address. The member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) made much about destroying Medicare as we know it. I would put this in the same sort of category of bleating and nitpicking. People can say it for as long as they like. We have Labor health ministers on the record saying that, if Medicare does not evolve, it is going to die&mdash;and it will. Any health system has to evolve. It has to look at new and better ways of doing things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am absolutely unapologetic for trying to find a way to give some access to basic Medicare services for the large number of people in rural and remote Australia who have access to nothing whatsoever. That will occur by opening pharmacy agencies, which is going to be ecstatically popular. It will happen; it will happen before the next election; and it will certainly happen substantially by the end of this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member said that we are going to close a third of Medicare agencies: yes, we are going to close some agencies. I have not made a final decision on the closure of a single agency yet. As to the fact that a union chooses to release a list&mdash;you can take that for what I think it is worth. In many cases&mdash;when Medicare opened and offices were located&mdash;we were in a period when bulk-billing was substantially less and the need for cash was substantially greater. Bulk-billing has increased dramatically in the last 12 years. Off the top of my head, for vocationally registered GP services, about 86 to 87 per cent of all services are bulk&hyphen;billed; for non-vocationally registered GP services, about 92 per cent of all services are bulk-billed. The need that might have existed 12 years ago does not exist today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I can do is provide access to a basic service. Sure, it is not as good as a Medicare office, but it is better than nothing for the very large number of Australians in rural and remote Australia. I simply cannot provide Medicare offices in every location where people want them. As shadow minister I had an enormous number of people requesting, `Can I have a Medicare office here; can I have a Medicare office there'. I said no in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6056"> virtually all cases. The simple thing is we will never fund it; we will never finance it. It is a different way of doing things. I think it is a substantially better way of doing things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Shortland said that pharmacies are extremely concerned. Maybe he talks to different people. As I said, I think he will find that pharmacies can benefit from this proposal, and the pharmacists I talk to are ecstatic at the prospect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He did make one comment that I think is worth replying to seriously. He asked: what will happen in a town where there are five pharmacies, one pharmacy gets it and the others do not? That is a fair enough question. I do not want to incorporate something that becomes capitalised into the cost of a pharmacy and that gives one pharmacist a benefit over every other pharmacist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are looking to do at this stage where a situation like that existed&mdash;it is subject to final negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild&mdash;is to choose one pharmacy on the basis of certain merit that will be open and easily contestable. That agency would be contested again every couple of years. So they would have to keep winning it on merit. We will provide certain benefits and certain moneys to the pharmacy for doing that. We will do it to that one pharmacy but, because it is openly contestable every couple of years, it will not get capitalised into the cost. We will let every other pharmacy in the town have access to the same thing, if they wish, at their cost. The benefit will be in terms of a Commonwealth payment, but we will not exclude other pharmacies in that town so that everyone will have access to it. I think it will work very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Shortland made some comments about giving health to the states and how we will have eight to nine different health systems. If that is what he thinks, I have to wonder why the previous government attempted to do something on the whole COAG process for the past six years, because they did try and they failed. I might fail but I am certainly going to try. I am going to try because the benefits are very substantial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you had a look at the health care system in Australia today and you had to say that one <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thing was not working, it would be federal-state relations. The different jurisdiction between the Commonwealth and the states in health is leading to very poor outcomes for the public. I will give the House a couple of examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example is in palliative care. Eighty per cent of people who are dying would like to die at home. It is cheap for people to die at home. People can die at home for an average cost of $50 a day. That involves backup, if they need it, of up to six hours individualised nursing care per person per day. These figures come from the Silver Chain Nursing Association in Western Australia. You might then ask: if people want to die at home and can die at home for a tenth of the cost of dying in a public hospital, why are a substantial number of people still dying in public hospitals? The simple reason is that the states pay for the public hospitals while the Commonwealth pays for home based care. The two have never been able to get together and agree on a way of doing something that will be of benefit to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Another example is with nursing home care for people who have become frail and aged. While there are 75,000 people who are in nursing homes around Australia, there are another 75,000 people who are being looked after by friends and relatives. The crunch point for the family will be when the person becomes incontinent because then, all of a sudden, the care goes up fairly dramatically. The family will need to find another $2,500 to $3,000 a year for incontinence aids. I can offer that family a nursing home bed at $32,000 a year but I cannot offer the family $2,500 to $3,000 for incontinence aids to keep the person out of the nursing home and let them look after the relative at home. That shows the fundamental stupidity of our present system. We run the nursing homes; the states are responsible for appliances; but the two do not have the capacity to get together and talk about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> When looking at the long-term future of hospitals, the trend right around the world is to attempt to put as much community based care as possible in place, because it is cheaper and it is what people want. For instance, there <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6057"> are seven health districts in Victoria. The southern health district has managed to get their hospital beds down to two per 1,000 of the population. That is still high by international standards, but it is the lowest in Victoria. They are still providing a good standard of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is stopping them getting that figure down even further is that they cannot provide the home based care to back up what they need to do to further use their hospital beds in a sensible way. That would be okay if we had a magic pudding and did not have to worry about increased technology, an ageing population or any of those things. Unless we seriously try to sort out some of these stupid inequities, the health system will not evolve, it will be unsustainable and it will continue to not meet people's needs.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member interjects, `Why are you cutting HACC?' The fact is that HACC has six per cent real growth maintained in it. At a time of incredible budget stringency, we were able to increase the real growth in HACC by six per cent. Yes, we increase user pays, but up to the level that already exists in Victoria. The fact is that if you are a Victorian you will not pay a cent more. It is up to the levels that exist in Victoria already.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you as a local MP with a substantial aged population that in the four years that the Victorian government has been there I have not received a letter about the fact that Victoria has the highest HACC charges of anywhere in Australia. People are prepared to pay that. They think that they are getting good value. All we are doing is increasing it to the level of other states and maintaining six per cent real growth, which will be a substantial improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Newcastle made some comments on nursing homes that that will cost pensioners $100,000. For full pensioners it will cost nothing, but I could not have expected him to have read the budget documents. Unless your family can find the money, how are they to pay for this? If you are a full pensioner you pay nothing. What is going <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to happen to the 40 per cent of people who are in for less than six months? How is that going to operate? Very simply&mdash;they will pay nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we are copying the system you introduced for hostels. Today, hostels contain a substantial number of frail aged people in nursing home categories 4 and 5 and sometimes category 3. You were happy to introduce this yourself, and then you bleat when we take your system, introduce it in nursing homes and put very substantial safeguards in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would have someone in a hostel who pays an entry contribution and then moves to a nursing home on the same site reimbursed their entry fee. How stupid is that. Can I tell you the effect of what you have done. I do not know whether those opposite have been in nursing homes recently, but they are, by and large, falling down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bob Gregory did a paper for you and showed that nursing homes around Australia under your scheme would need capital of $1 billion just to get them up to the standards required for basic safety. That was your program and your administration of nursing homes. Elderly people are in unsafe and unfit buildings. Have a look at your own record before you whinge and complain. You can whinge and complain as much as you like and you will in the end get the same result as you got in Lindsay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final issue I want to comment on is the removal of pharmaceutical benefits from non-residents of Australia. I am informed that not long ago the Customs Service looked at a charter flight going to an unnamed country. It checked the luggage of every person on this charter flight. Half of them were taking back hoarded pharmaceuticals, under the Australian pharmaceutical benefits system, either for resale in the country or for the benefit of their relatives. Are you seriously suggesting that that should continue?</PARA>

<PARA>This is an opportunity for me to respond to a few of the remarks made by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) during the closing of the second reading debate. In those remarks, the minister made a few comments on Medicare offices and the use of pharmacies as agencies in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I could use this opportunity to ask the minister to confirm a few things for us on this issue, given that he opened the debate in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6059"> his remarks a few minutes ago. First of all, the minister has said that he has not made any final decisions on whether any particular Medicare offices will be closing. I am happy to wait until the minister is listening.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that I have the minister's attention. Given that a number of members and senators have issued press statements claiming that they have personal assurances from the minister that their local Medicare offices will not be closing, I would appreciate his advice as to whether or not he has given these personal assurances to certain conservative members and senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I ask this is that, in Senate estimates, the department advised us that no such assurances have been given by the department, the minister or the minister's office. I would like to hear from the minister himself that no such assurances have been given to any member or senator that their particular Medicare office will remain open. If the minister has given such an assurance, I would be very interested to know the circumstances, given that he claims not to have made any final decision on the future of any particular Medicare office. If that is the case, that will certainly clarify things for many of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to multiple pharmacies in Ballarat, Bendigo or any other particular town, the minister has said that there will be an open and contestable process for deciding which is the lucky pharmacy&mdash;whether it is in one of those towns or another town. Could the minister confirm what that open and contestable process might be? For example, will it be an auction, or will it be some process that requires the pharmacy concerned to part with money to the government? I would be grateful if the minister could clarify those issues.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow health minister has asked me to reply on two points. I am very happy to do that for him. He said that I had given assurances that I had not made a decision about the future of any Medicare office. I think that what I had actually said was that I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had not made a decision about which offices were to close. That does not mean that I have not made a decision as to which offices might stay open. The two do not necessarily follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a very large number of conversations with my colleagues&mdash;without giving specific examples; I cannot say. There are clearly some very large offices that it would be impossible to close. There are some very large Medicare offices where the number of new claims is not dropping, where doctors may not bulk bill much and where there is still a very large need because there may not be another office in close proximity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is possible to say that there are a number of offices that will not be closing. Off the top of my head, I am not able to give that answer. It is quite possible that some offices could be staying open definitely because, as I said, the decision has been on the basis that none have been decided to be closed. Clearly, some will need to stay open.</PARA>

I am certainly being hassled by my back bench colleagues in the coalition, who are very keen to get these into their electorates.

The following day, in answer to a question without notice, the minister said, in reference to Tunboa:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have not acted as a director at any stage since that time.</PARA>
<PARA>Against this background there is an unresolved question as to when the minister resigned as a director and secretary of Tunboa. The minister has not yet provided a clear answer to that question. It appears to me, however, that irrespective of when he resigned as a director and secretary of Tunboa, the Minister for Finance has breached the Corporations Law in a number of serious respects&mdash;at least four separate breaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister admits that he had absolutely no involvement with Tunboa after 1986, including in the capacity of a director or secretary. He admits that during this period Tunboa traded, yet he has apparently not resigned as a director and secretary until the last week or so, therefore remaining a director and secretary of Tunboa for some 10 years without performing the duties required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the circumstances, the minister appears to have failed to have exercised the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person in a like position in a corporation would exercise&mdash;a breach of section 232(4) of the Corporations Law. Furthermore, it is doubtful that the minister complied with his specific duties in respect of the director's statement required by section 301 of the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the company Tunboa apparently operated with only one director after <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> August 1986. For a company to operate with only one director is contrary to section 219 of the old Companies Code and contrary to section 221 of the new Corporations Law, until section 221 was amended in December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And there is more! Under the Corporations Law, the company must notify the Australian Securities Commission within one month of a director or company secretary leaving the company&mdash;set out in section 242(9). It should be noted that the latest annual return for Tunboa, lodged on 3 January this year, still lists the Minister for Finance as a director and also lists both the minister and Mr Kenneth Searle as company secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 83(2) of the Corporations Law deems a secretary to be knowingly concerned, unless the contrary is proved, in any contravention of various sections, including failure to notify the Australian Securities Commission of any changes in directors or company secretary, or failure to provide an annual return which contains the required details.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of the utmost concern that Australia should have as its Minister for Finance someone who has apparently breached at least four sections of the Corporations Law. I call on the Australian Securities Commission to investigate this matter as a matter of priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Securities Commission has produced the `Company Director's Survival Kit'. In this kit the ASC makes it clear that the duties and responsibilities of company directors are very serious indeed. It says the law takes a very strict approach. The duties owed by directors and other officers are viewed as virtually the same as the duties owed by a trustee of the estate of a deceased person. They also say that&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directors cannot allow themselves to remain uninformed about the state of their company's business. They cannot satisfy themselves that any decision is truly in the overall best interests of their company if they are just `rubber stamps' for various proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>The courts are able to look at the special skills or education of a particular director when deciding whether that director has met the required level of care and diligence. But <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6061"> if the Finance Minister does not attend to these matters, how can the ASC or the courts expect anyone else to? Section 83 of the Corporations Law puts the burden of proof squarely on the minister and a breach of section 232(4) is a serious matter which can give rise to both criminal and civil penalties. I call on the Australian Securities Commission to investigate these important matters as a matter of urgency.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on behalf of people enduring untold suffering within Burma. Since my last speech on this subject, Burma has been accorded observer status at ASEAN. The motive behind this decision would appear logical in an academic sense. Drawing the present junta into the regional community was expected to encourage the regime to reform from within. The result has in fact been the opposite. A worst case scenario came to pass. A brutal regime craving legitimacy was emboldened by the granting of observer status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wake of the ASEAN olive branch, the junta has undertaken a massive crackdown upon its political opponents. The parallels between present day Burma and the former apartheid regime in South Africa need not be drawn. They are obvious. However, the force for change within South Africa did not come from `constructive engagement'. It came from uncompromising international sanctions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SLORC must be made aware that its domestic actions will simply not be tolerated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tied up in the ever present tragedy of modern Burma is that the majority of the population are followers of the Buddhist faith. They practice a pacifist belief, displaying a degree of tolerance that we could all learn from. However, the result of such tolerance is that the people of Burma have absorbed the assault from their political masters. They have displayed dignity in the face of a regime with physical contempt for its own population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In saying this, I would like to draw the attention of this House to the Stalinist style forced labour being used on the Burmese people. I do not use the name of Stalin lightly. The manner in which enormous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> construction projects are being conducted, involving great human sacrifice, warrants such comparisons. Indeed, Amnesty International recently released a damning report saying that what particularly distinguished the Burmese junta from other modern tyrannies was its use of slave labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Conditions in the slave labour camps', the report says, `are so harsh that hundreds of prisoners have died as a result . . . elderly, sick, and even handicapped people are placed in leg&hyphen;irons and forced to work.' Children are also being used as forced labour on gigantic government and foreign sponsored schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The money and benefits derived from such projects&mdash;constructed on the bones of the Burmese people&mdash;cannot even be justified as contributing to the wealth of the nation. The insidious corruption of the junta sees this money line the pockets of generals. It is a modern tragedy to see a country once described as `the rice bowl of Asia' languishing in poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw attention to the plight of one person in particular: a shining light in a sea of darkness; a petite lady whose beautiful and serene face belies deep anxiety and suffering for her country. Many, including myself, fear for the safety of Aung San Suu Kyi.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The status recently accorded to SLORC leaves a fearless and beautiful leader, and a legitimately elected government, essentially stranded. As a close friend of hers recently told a journalist, `She is a Mandela without a de Klerk.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the most bitterly disappointing aspect of the situation is the potential within Burma that remains unfilled. The nation has the potential to become an economic powerhouse. With a democratic government, a population of some 44 million people and the ability to trade internationally, we could see an economic backwater become another `Asian tiger'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6062"> International diplomacy is never cut and dried. We all understand that politics is about negotiation and compromise. However, this must be done in the perspective of achieving an overall goal. As I understand it, our for eign minister is working very hard behind the scenes for a positive outcome, and for this he must be commended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said that Australia must actively pursue recognition of the international human rights standards it publicly endorses. I agree that we must `practice what we preach'. Australia cannot afford to view human rights through a convenient prism of differing cultural values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw on the South African experience again. A fellow Nobel peace prize winner to Aung San Suu Kyi, Bishop Desmond Tutu, recently said of the plight of Burma:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International pressure can change the situation in Burma. Tough sanctions, not constructive engagement, brought about change in South Africa . . . . This is the only language that tyrants understand.</PARA>
<PARA>We, as federal parliamentarians and as Australians, must continue to fight for the vulnerable and forcefully articulate the truth on their behalf. Australians can play a role in ending the tragedy in Burma, and in the future can significantly contribute to its return to democracy and prosperity. These gentle and passive people deserve nothing less.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<ELECTORATE> (Melbourne)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.40 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am proud of the fact that I represent an electorate with a very large Asian Australian population and people of other non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds. I am proud of the fact that I have a daughter and numerous nieces and nephews of mixed descent. I am proud of the progress Australia has made towards Aboriginal reconciliation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I want to repudiate utterly the hatred and fear unleashed by comments by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), the Mayor of Port Lincoln and others in the community. I recognise that the support occurring in many quarters for these comments is largely based on economic uncertainty and very rapid change in our community. It is only natural, in some respects, that the sort of scapegoating that we have seen in many societies will emerge in these circumstances. It is incumbent upon us all to emphasise the great benefits that immigration from all societies <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has given and will continue to give Australia. For example, greater access to markets in our region, greater skills and diversity&mdash;a whole range of benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley has made numerous ridiculous statements. The suggestion that the problems of Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Rwanda are examples of multiculturalism at work are an example of how ludicrous some of her statements are. Another of her allegations is that Asian Australians form ghettos. I live in an area where there are so&hyphen;called ghettos. I represent an area where particular ethnic groups are gathered together. Looking at some of the tenants councils in those areas that I represent, there are Vietnamese Australians, Somalian Australians, Timorese Australians, Chinese Australians, Turkish Australians, Latin American Australians and Anglo Australians all working together and living basically in harmony, no less harmoniously than other people in the community around them, all interacting in a positive way. It is ludicrous to suggest that they are ghettos. I have played in local cricket teams with Vietnamese cricketers. My doctor is Indian Australian. Numerous other professionals that I deal and interact with in the community are of Asian origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley suggested that Asian Australians are of different religion and, therefore, that is some sort of criterion for keeping them out. I thought we had freedom of religion in this country. I would also point out that a very substantial proportion of Asian migrants coming to Australia are in fact Christians. A big proportion of the Vietnamese are Catholics. Most Filipinos are Catholics. A significant proportion of Chinese origin migrants are Christians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final and perhaps ultimately most ridiculous statement is that Aboriginal Australians are not disadvantaged because of their Aboriginality&mdash;surely a classic example of the great comment by Tacitus that we definitely must hate the ones we have hurt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is already clear that this gospel of hate is causing great problems for Australia through increased racial vilification and even violence and is damaging us overseas. The refusal by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to tackle the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6063"> issue head&hyphen;on is contributing to that problem. He has gone to extreme lengths to avoid the headline, `Howard repudiates Hanson' because of a two&hyphen;faced approach in pursuit of the votes that appear to be there in support of her views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So he is happy to say, `Yes, I believe in non&hyphen;discrimination' but he will avoid at all cost any sort of repudiation of her position that leads to a headline, `Howard repudiates Hanson' because he is after those votes. He is playing with fire and he does not care what that does to Australia's reputation overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the member for Oxley, when he talks about political correctness the Prime Minister represents a view that looks back to the 1950s. I grew up in an era of different political correctness when women were second&hyphen;class citizens, censorship was rampant, Aborigines were almost seen as subhuman, sex was a deep, dark secret and single mothers were in some way pariahs in the community. That was when you had serious political correctness and the main perpetrators of this were the National Party. These people do not like the fact that there has been a change in community values in this country whereby it is more tolerant and open, and they want to enforce the old points of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that this phenomenon will last. It will be like the Joh for Canberra phenomenon and the Bronwyn Bishop phenomenon, because most Australians are tolerant. Most Australians are not bigots. Most Australians are open to debate. Most Australians are not full of the bile, bitterness and hatred which fuels this sort of stuff. In saying that, I include most working&hyphen;class Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Prime Minister and the member for Oxley that I and many others will be there to resist this trend, to resist this bigotry and to resist this hatred with every breath in our bodies on behalf of all Australians, particularly Asian Australians and Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to reply to comments made recently by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). He was in Townsville last Friday and some of the statements that he made there are just not true. About the only thing the member got right in his comments was that I am the member for Herbert.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a start, the member for Batman said I have nothing to say at the moment about the question of unemployment. I don't think I have ever stopped talking about employment prospects in the Townsville region since I stepped into this parliament. Indeed, the CES presently has unlimited funds to support apprenticeships and traineeships in the Townsville region, which is great news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last sitting I stood here and told the House about an agreement reached between the Townsville State High School and Townsville Regional Group Apprenticeship Services, witnessed by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp).</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MAREK" NAMEID="LK6">

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HK6">Mr LINDSAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And a good Victorian. For the benefit of the member for Batman, I will repeat some of the points the principal of Townsville High School, Bill Sperring, said in relation to that agreement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This initiative provides a direct working and productive link between a secondary school and an apprenticeship training organisation . . . The gains of our individual students will be that they can see, and will be associated with apprentices first hand to know the requirements for vocational training in the workforce . . . This is a real working link between an education and training organisation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>For the further benefit of the member for Batman, I would also like to repeat to the House that TORGAS general manager Alan Morris has indicated publicly that he expects the number of apprentices and trainees in the Townsville region to increase from around 180 to more than 1,000 within the next 18 months as a result of the changes the coalition has introduced under the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6064">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Townsville State High School and TORGAS like the program. It would seem the only person who does not think this program will benefit Townsville's young high school students is the member for Batman. But then again, being a Melburnian, what would he know about Townsville and regional Queensland issues anyway?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind the member for Batman that, under Labor, apprenticeship and traineeship numbers fell to their lowest levels in some 30 years&mdash;not to mention what happened to unemployment and interest rates. That shows just how committed the former government was to creating job prospects for Australia's young men and women. I am pleased to say that this government, unlike the previous government, is committed to turning that situation around. Earlier this month the member for Batman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I assume he means the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are one&hyphen;sixth of the way through a full term of government. It is not as though they have not had time, because their budget strategy is going to fix it all. Their workplace relations bill is going to fix it all.</PARA>
<PARA>The member was talking about employment at that time. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill will go a long way to fixing many things in my electorate of Herbert, the electorate of Batman and throughout Australia. The Democrats have now taken the responsible step of working with the government instead of obstructing for the sake of obstructing, and the bill will be implemented at an early date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September 1995, the Townsville Chamber of Commerce, which represents about 500 businesses in the Townsville region,  conducted a survey of its members. The survey was conducted to identify issues Townsville businesses wanted the Chamber of Commerce to address for them. The No. 1 issue of concern that was identified by the Townsville Chamber of Commerce was the unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have done a search through the speeches the member for Batman has made in this House just to see what he has had to say about unfair dismissal. Of all the times he has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> spoken in this chamber, he has mentioned the words `unfair dismissal law' only once, and when he did he claimed the law has helped to create some 730,000 jobs throughout Australia&mdash;probably mostly lawyers. Try selling that to the small business men and women of Herbert and see how far you get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, do you know who else wants to see the unfair dismissal laws repealed? None other than the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr. The Labor Premier of New South Wales certainly said that kids are going without jobs because of the way the unfair dismissal provisions in the federal law work. The unfair dismissal laws Labor introduced by stealth did more to stifle employment and punish small business in Townsville and Australia than any other single decision in the last 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What am I doing about unemployment in Townsville? For a start, I have voted to overturn Labor's unfair dismissal laws. I seriously doubt whether Martin Ferguson has done the same or would ever have the guts to do the same.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The drug problems of the Sydney suburb of Cabramatta have been well documented in the media over the last few years. Having lived next door to Cabramatta most of my life&mdash;my electorate covered that suburb before the last boundary change&mdash;I have watched time and time again community leaders, politicians and ordinary citizens try to come up with solutions to the problem. Not only has no solution been forthcoming but the problem has become much worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In May, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> highlighted the continuing study of Dr Lisa Maher, an academic with the National Drug and Alcohol Research Council at the University of New South Wales. The article exposed a new breed of addicts shooting up in the alleys, doorways and stairwells of Cabramatta. They are children&mdash;children who do not fit the traditional stereotype we imagine when we hear the word `junkie'. It personally made my skin crawl knowing that many of those kids <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6065"> talked about in that article live in my electorate. It also filled me with a very deep sadness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the 130 kids that Dr Maher has questioned about their habit, most of them still live at home with their parents. They are your next&hyphen;door neighbour's child, your own children's friend or perhaps even one of your own children. They do not have the hardened experience of street kids, nor do they have any history of gang membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read with growing fear and loathing as Dr Maher explained her findings. A professional who spent four years studying crack and heroin users in Brooklyn in New York City, Dr Maher pointed out that what she is seeing on a daily basis in Cabramatta is nothing like that which she has experienced in the United States. Let me use her words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The youngest I know of are 11 and 12. They're definitely the youngest addicts I've ever seen in my life. But what really concerns me is the number of them. There must be now several hundred.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a tragedy that is being lived every day of the week in my community, and it is a tragedy that takes other perverse forms. The improper disposal of syringes by drug users has now reached epidemic proportions in my area. Residents' tempers have reached breaking point as they wake up every morning to syringes lying in their front gardens. Parents are pulling out their hair in fear and frustration as their children play in these secluded parklands popular with addicts. Small business owners are losing their customers as people fear to shop in the more secluded area populated with the users or fear to walk down public stairwells in parking centres, knowing full well they will have to run the gauntlet of discarded used needles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can appreciate, looking at the overall needle exchange program, that the problem of improper needle disposal would seem a small one. However, when you realise that Sydney's intravenous drug problem is now centred on a several kilometre radius in Sydney's south&hyphen;west and that, of the small percentage of needles not returned under the needle exchange program, most are now left in backyards, frontyards, laneways and the parks of my community, I am sure you can understand that what seems now like a small problem is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> actually very concentrated and is causing major concern and frustration in Cabramatta and surrounding areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the core of this problem are the addicts who are getting around the needle exchange program&mdash;they are not actually part of it&mdash;who buy their needles from pharmacists and feel no compulsion or responsibility to dispose of their syringes correctly or exchange them safely with the authorities. The question is how do we stop this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, I can say what the answer is not. It is not to put an end to the needle exchange program operating in Cabramatta. From talking to people on the ground who are very much involved with addicts on a day-to-day basis, part of the answer is to improve the service and to work harder at impressing upon users that, despite what they may think, they have a responsibility to dispose of their syringes safely and considerately. It can and must be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a responsibility to the ordinary, hardworking citizens of our area to clean up the used needle problem, but we also have a responsibility to provide clean needles to the children of our community who are now paying $30 for a cap of heroin in some back alley of Cabramatta. We can cure them of heroin addiction; we cannot cure them of AIDS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present the only needle exchange centre operating in Cabramatta is run by a group of committed youth workers at the Cabramatta Community Youth Centre. This centre is due to close on 1 December. Fairfield City Council will soon take a vote on the development application for an improved centre run by professional staff who are experienced in the field of drug rehabilitation. If the application is denied, then basically no centre will exist in Cabramatta&mdash;no needles will be exchanged, the needle disposal problem will get even further out of control and the number of HIV/AIDS cases will skyrocket. A new needle exchange centre&mdash;run by professionals&mdash;will develop a more effective outreach campaign to users, which will hopefully result in less needles in my constituents' backyards. On the other side of the coin, perhaps we need to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6066"> look at the pharmacies in the area and the manner in which they sell the syringes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am no expert on this matter, but I wonder if anyone has looked at the practicalities of initiating a system where bona fide users of needles for medical reasons carry some sort of identification or doctor's certificate to display when they purchase their syringes from a chemist. This would mean addicts would have to report to the needle exchange centre, dirty needles in hand, to obtain clean needles for use. As I said, I am no expert, but I would be interested to hear whether such an arrangement is workable. It certainly has not been tried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a nation we have spent the last eight months in a state of shock trying to come to terms with the Port Arthur massacre. Thank God we as politicians, as public representatives, have risen to the challenge given to us by the people of Australia who have demanded tougher gun laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to the House, to the people of Australia, that what is happening in Cabramatta is a symbol of evil that also must be addressed. An enveloping, devouring sore is festering on our doorstop and it must be treated. Our kids must be saved.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with what the previous speaker, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), has just said. I rise tonight to speak on an issue which should concern anyone who has ever placed a child in a shopping trolley. Research in the United States has revealed that almost 25,000 children a year are treated in emergency departments for injuries sustained following falls from a shopping trolley. What makes these statistics even more frightening is the fact that 79 per cent of these injuries occur to the head and neck. This increases to 92 per cent for children under the age of one year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The researcher who compiled these figures came to the conclusion that shopping trolleys should be banned until they are redesigned for safety. An assistant professor of paediatrics at the Ohio State University said that these are not trivial injuries and that they can be life threatening. `So what!' I hear you say. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `You're talking about the United States.' Well, Mr Speaker, it is an unfortunate fact that, every week, one in four supermarkets across Australia has a shopping trolley related accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mater Children's Hospital in Queensland has carried out a survey of shopping trolley accidents based solely on patients who have been presented to the casualty departments of the seven hospitals in the Brisbane South health region. In the four years from 1988 to 1991, these hospitals reported 101 injuries: 81 per cent of these occurred to children under the age of five, 18 per cent required hospitalisation, 34 per cent suffered concussion and five per cent suffered fractures to the skull. While the majority of these injuries were sustained from falls, more than a third were sustained when the trolley containing the child toppled over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the year ending June 1995 there were 15 recorded injuries. Of these, two required hospitalisation and one was so serious the child had to be transferred to a larger hospital for specialist treatment. Thankfully, there is no record in this report of a death occurring due to a fall. However, this is not the case in the United States, where a three&hyphen;year&hyphen;old and an infant died in separate accidents in 1992. Hopefully, we will never witness a death in this country through something so simple as a fall from a shopping trolley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the danger is ever present under the current system. You see, there are currently no laws governing the design of shopping trolleys. This point has been brought to my attention by a constituent of mine, Mrs Kerrie Beaver. Mrs Beaver has done extensive research into the matter and has uncovered a swag of information which suggests current shopping trolleys are not designed for the safe transport of children. Further to this, research shows that children transported unrestrained in shopping trolleys can fall easily. However, simply adding restraining belts to current models will not prevent the trolley from tipping. Of course, shopping trolleys were originally designed for one purpose&mdash;to make it convenient to carry one's groceries, not to carry children. What is needed is a trolley which will satisfy both needs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6067">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to research carried out to date, the ideal shopping trolley would have an extra large basket for storage, a wide basket for stability, high sides to prevent children falling out, the basket position lowered to give a safe centre of gravity and a wide wheel arrangement. Also, the seat should offer more than one position so as to accommodate children of differing sizes, and a suitable restraining device should be fitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of those present in the House may feel this is a trivial matter. Indeed, Brisbane's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> made light of the issue in a recent issue, suggesting I was trying for the housewife's vote. All I can say to those who feel this way is this: take a walk through any children's ward of any hospital and then tell me that injury to a child is a trivial matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for the reasons I have outlined tonight that I have joined with Mrs Beaver in her quest to have a national standard introduced for the design of shopping trolleys. I feel this is long overdue and, if we can avoid just one more child being injured, it would be well worth the effort.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) and (2) The National Rail Corporation (NR) and the Australian National Railways Commission (AN) as train operators have provided the information below in answer to question 1. The reasons for  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6069"> the restrictions and when they will be lifted are the responsibility of the track owners, AN in SA and the Public Transport Corporation of Victoria (PTC) in Victoria. AN has provided the information in answer to question 2 for the SA section of the line. The Commonwealth does not have access to the information required to provide an answer to question 2 for the Victorian section of the line. However, advice on this matter has been sought from Victoria and I will pass on the response when it is received.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) My Department is fully involved in the work coordinated by the Office of Government Information Technology to address the Year 2000 issue, including representation on the Year 2000 Working Group. In that context, the Department is currently preparing the Year 2000 Compliance Plan. In preparation for this plan, preliminary assessments have been made on all software and hardware.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All software applications of the Department have been recently rewritten or are currently being redeveloped or planned for redevelopment. Therefore, Year 2000 Compliance has already been achieved or will be achieved as a result of redevelopment. The costing of the Year 2000 Compliance element in those redevelopments is, therefore, marginal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All vendors of system software have been contacted and, at this stage, the Department has assurances that its system software is either already Year 2000 compliant or will be in the near future. The Department expects any upgrades required for Year 2000 Compliance to be at the vendor's expense. Similarly, the Department has contacted all hardware suppliers about Year 2000 Compliance and expects upgrading, where necessary, to be provided at the vendor's expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Institute of Family Studies has informed all staff of the potential problems with computer systems leading up to the Year 2000. All software has been examined to ensure that it supports date fields beyond 1999. An Information Technology Manager has been appointed as the senior manager with responsibility for this issue. A Year 2000 Compliance Plan is being prepared for the Office of Government Information Technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) operates very few applications systems liable to be affected by the change of date at the end of the century. It has undertaken a review of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6071"> this issue and does not anticipate any major difficulties.</PARA>
