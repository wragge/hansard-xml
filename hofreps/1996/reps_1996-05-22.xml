<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, as Manager of Opposition Business in the House I would like to raise concerns about what occurred last night which we think goes to the question of the privileges and entitlements of members in this House to be heard. On three occasions in the debate last night, where we had circulated a number of amendments in relation to the establishment of committees in this House, two different deputy speakers in the chair ignored the call on our side of the House. They did not see our side of the House, despite the fact, in our view, that those speakers were clearly in view and on their feet before the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) was subsequently called.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two matters of privilege associated with this, Mr Speaker: firstly, members are not being given the opportunity they should to speak in this House and, in our view, the chair is not recognising as it should the call of speakers on this side of the House; secondly, the issues in question go to the very functioning of this House and the committee structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply raise this issue with you, Mr Speaker, and ask you to think about it. I indicate to you that, if this practice continues, we on this side of the House will have to look at what other options exist to consider our position and to seek redress.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know the right honourable member for New England has been in the place a long time and thinks that he knows it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all. I did not rise on a point of privilege. I sought indulgence, which was extended to me, and indicated that the point that I was raising under indulgence went to matters including the privileges of members of this House.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, that just illustrates what I was about to say: the member for Hotham rose apparently on an indulgence. He did not, in the last instance, raise a point of order. If it were a point of order, it should relate specifically to our standing orders. I would suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that while he might well seek that members of the opposition be recognised, it is certainly not a matter of privilege, which I understood him to be asserting, whether or not members are called on one side of the chamber or the other. If matters pertaining to people who are to be called are to be recognised, it is strictly a matter of who the chair recognises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one who sat for 13 years in opposition, including in front of one now in the House who is a former Speaker of this place, I can assure the honourable gentleman that the discretion as to who is called should and does remain entirely in that person who, for the time being, is in the chair of this place. I suggest to him that the point he has just raised is entirely frivolous and is quite contrary to the practice that he and his colleagues asserted through that time they were in government. I suggest we get on with the business of the House.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I ask leave of the House to move a motion relating to the appointment of a Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies. By way of explanation, last night I leapt up like a rocket to seek the call, beating the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), I would say, by at least a half&hyphen;head, but the Leader of the House got the call and the result was that the adjournment was put through. So I ask leave to move a motion relating to the appointment of a Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Leave is not granted. I will respond to the point made by the member for Hotham. I watched the proceedings with some considerable interest last night. In light of the fact that there were a large number of divisions, there was a great deal of milling as members moved from one side of the House to the other. I remind all members that the allocation of the call is a matter for the discretion of the chair. Standing order 61 provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Speaker shall call upon the Member who, in the Speaker's opinion, first rose in his or her place&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It is sometimes difficult for the occupant of the chair to determine who rose first. I think that was the case a number of times last night. In a close call, we do not have the benefit of a photo&hyphen;finish facility, although some of the racing enthusiasts in our midst might want to extend some of the paraphernalia already in the House. The decision of the chair can be challenged but it must be challenged immediately and not subsequently as it was done last night.</PARA></INTERJECT></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reading debate on the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill came before the House last night. This legislation does not really have regard for the future of the Australian shipping industry or to Australia's national and international shipping interests. In a few words, this is treacherous legislation. It is legislation that is designed to destroy the Australian shipping industry, to give substantial advantage to foreign shipping interests that service this nation and to destroy Australian seafarers' jobs and damage their families. It has been put forward without any regard whatsoever to the impact that it will have upon the Australian shipping industry and upon shareholders and investors in the Australian shipping industry. I will return later to the impact it will have upon the Australian sugar industry, but Mackay Sugar is going to suffer a great deal if this legislation passes through the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The substance of this legislation is that it will remove the cash grants or capital assistance to Australian shipowners on the purchase of vessels, it will remove accelerated depreciation and it will remove the rebate of the PAYE tax payments by Australian seafarers where ships spend most of their time in international trades. It will remove the rebate of those PAYE payments to the Australian shipowners. In other words, where an Australian ship is operating for the majority of its time and spending the majority of its activity in international trades, then the PAYE deductions from seafarers on that ship&mdash;which are currently being rebated to the shipowner&mdash;will go straight back into the Australian Taxation Office and straight back into consolidated revenue. It will be a substantial disadvantage to the Australian shipowner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, almost farcical, that this so-called saving, set out in the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), will not be a saving to Australian revenue. Ultimately, it will mean that, if the government is successful in what it is about, Australian seafarers will be substituted by foreign seafarers. Australian seafarers' earnings and tax payments, which are being collected from them <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1022"> now, will disappear and we will have foreign seafarers who will be accounting for their income abroad. As the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), said last night in his speech, it is not a saving; it is an illusion and will cause considerable damage to the Australian shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the background to this legislation? The background is a longstanding vendetta, particularly by the National Party and some shippers, against Australian seafarers, against the Maritime Union of Australia and against the trade union movement. There were repeated misrepresentations by the minister, when he was in opposition, about the effect and the beneficiaries of the PAYE section of the legislation. He repeatedly referred to it, as did the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) last evening, as a rort, as a benefit, for Australian seafarers. That is a blatant falsity, and they know it to be that. But they have peddled that line because it suits some of their constituents. They have peddled that line when they know full well that the rebate of the PAYE deductions goes to the shipowners in the circumstances that I outlined earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this parliament of Australia we have a situation now where the minister responsible for the Australian shipping industry and Australia's shipping interests internationally is the champion of foreign shipowners. It is very clear from this legislation, and it is very clear from his repeated utterances, that his priority is the protection and the benefiting of foreign shipowners. It is an incredible situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Recently, the minister has taken on as his maritime adviser none other than the former executive director of the Australian Chamber of Shipping. The Australian Chamber of Shipping, as was pointed out last evening, is the lobby group for foreign shipping interests in this country. Could you possibly imagine a situation where the European Commission&mdash;or the German minister for transport, the Japanese minister for transport or the minister for transport of any other country that has a sense of national involvement and pride&mdash;took on to their staff the adviser of foreign shipping to advise them on domestic ship ping? It is an incredible situation. I believe that it is without parallel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I get on very well with the former executive director of the Australian Chamber of Shipping&mdash;we have been friends for many years&mdash;but there is a direct conflict of interest here. It is an intolerable situation where that gentleman has now been taken on to provide advice to the Australian Minister for Transport and Regional Development on shipping policy. It is an intolerable and an incredible situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the policy of other countries on this issue? They see&mdash;as some of us, certainly on this side of the House and most of the Australian industry, see&mdash;that there is a major multiplier effect in having a strong shipping industry. The actual number of seafarers and the work of seafarers is a minor part of the operation, but it is the crucial link. Control and development of your own shipping industry generates thousands upon thousands of jobs ashore in related activities. Let me quote from a document from the Commission of the European Communities entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shaping Europe's maritime future: A contribution to the competitiveness of maritime industries</EMPHASIS>, Brussels, 13, March 1996, page 2:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In issuing this Communication, the Commission intends to demonstrate its conviction that the maritime industries are essentially an industrial sector with a high potential for growth, development and technological improvement. Exploiting this potential will contribute to job creation across the Union.</PARA>
<PARA>The largest market in the world and the oldest shipping nations in the world are subscribers to that document. That document has been adopted by the commission, referred to the European parliament and is under consideration by the members of the European Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can go on from that and look at the Australian Maritime Network. The Australian Maritime Network is a voluntary group of people who are interested in furthering the development of shipping related activities ashore and the shipping industry itself. The list includes: shipowners, ship operators, managers, maritime transport unions, port authorities, terminal operators, customs agents, crewing agents, ship repair and ship building design, ship chandlers, maritime education, professional maritime associations, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1023"> maritime media, maritime insurance, P&amp;O clubs, arbitrators, adjusters and lawyers. There is a whole gamut of shore activities, and most of them are professional and administrative jobs. They are all activities which swing from the operation of ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What other strong shipping nations know, and what the European Commission has confirmed in that document from which I have just quoted, is that they all depend upon having a strong shipping industry. The British suffered under the Thatcher government from the destruction of their shipping industry. Britain: Britannia rules the waves, the greatest shipping fleets in the world, the ones that used to control shipping services into this country. The Thatcher government in the 1980s set about the destruction of the British shipping industry. As stated in an article headed `British shipowners do it tough, says study', the realisation has now come to that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Britain has one of the least attractive fiscal regimes in Europe. By comparison, Sweden and Belgium have fiscal regimes that are three times more favourable, with France and Germany not that far behind.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to refer to London. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">London remains the world's premier maritime centre.</PARA>
<PARA>But then it adds that it was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . also disclosed that the city's maritime net overseas earnings (excluding shipping itself), are, at &pound;1 billion a year, lower by 25 per cent compared to the level of revenue ten years ago.</PARA>
<PARA>The comparison those figures make are pre the Thatcher destruction, before Thatcher got in with the kinds of policies that this legislation entails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing here is a throwback to Thatcherism. They have picked up what Thatcher did, read about it some years ago, absorbed it&mdash;and cannot forget it. They do not seem to recognise what has happened in Europe since then. Now the Brits are fighting, trying to regain their industry. They are trying to regain their industry because of the substantial shore related benefits, jobs and activities that flow from it. That article also states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">UK shipowners continue to campaign for the restoration of the special capital allowances which the government removed in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA>That article from which I was quoting is dated May 1996. Then there is another article dated 13 May 1996 and headed `The city of London's maritime&hyphen;related earnings have declined in real terms by one&hyphen;third between 1984 and 1994'. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can go on looking at that those comparisons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Norway with 4&frac14; million people, one per cent of world GDP, controls 10 per cent of world shipping. Why? Because they are smart enough and have the wisdom to know, to realise, that there are 70,000 shore jobs swinging off control of that shipping. They do not have to own it but control it. That is the line we should be following, and that is the line we are arguing in this chamber here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is borne out of a longstanding animosity towards Australian seafarers and their families. It is really a throwback to the Peter Nixon days, to the old adversarial situation: hit the unions, fight the unions&mdash;from your predecessor. Take that dorothy dixer of 20 items denigrating waterside workers. The role of a minister&mdash;and I say this to the Minister for Transport&mdash;primarily is to solve problems, not create them; to weld people together, to weld industries together&mdash;workers and leadership and management&mdash;not to divide them. This is divisive, confrontationist legislation designed to destroy seafarers and their unions and it is the first attack upon the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Behind this is the advice coming from top level Treasury and Finance bureaucrats. I mention just one name, that of David Borthwick, so that it goes into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. At some time this is going to have to be sheeted home to these people who sit safe and comfortably in the cloistered havens of Treasury. Those Treasury and Finance bureaucrats do not have to compete with international consultants working for low wages, seven-day weeks, a one-month holiday a year with no international holiday trips at taxpayers' expense. They are comfortable and safe there. They have no competition in their jobs from international consultants.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1024">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should put a lot of that Treasury work out to the international marketplace and let those bureaucrats face up to the consequences. If we utilise the international market, we create a more level playing field, don't we. But let us do it in the area of economics advice and we will see the situation then, when the mistakes are brought out into the open&mdash;not buried away, as Mr Borthwick and his colleagues are able to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me mention one very quick instance. I became Assistant Treasurer. I went over to Treasury for a briefing. We had a cup of tea with a few biscuits, and talked. It was sparse; I do not want to create the impression of too much luxury over there. They were just plain biscuits with cups of tea and a bit of milk. One of the very senior officers sidled up to me and said, `Minister, this waterfront, now what sorts of problems are there with it? Of what kind of magnitude are they? Are there really problems on the waterfront?' I looked at him and I was speechless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here were the people who were at the most senior level advising government, the weight of whose advice is probably a hundred times the weight of any other department's, and they were asking me about the waterfront! I thought they might have read a report or found something. But that is the kind of advice which is coming forward. Those people are totally inadequate. That link with the people who are determined upon a course of trade union destruction and animosity towards the unions brings forward this kind of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see in the legislation is a betrayal of the Australian industry. It is in conflict with the former member for Gwydir, Ralph Hunt. Back in 1982 Ralph Hunt started the legislation which arose from the Crawford report. He was the one National Party minister for transport who had the wisdom to realise that the solution to these problems is to bring people together, understand them, make room for that understanding and get people working together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I took it on from there, we brought about tremendous reform in the industry. Not one hour was lost through dispute. It was a consensus approach, a recognition by people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> working in the industry that they had to make a contribution, they had to accept change&mdash;but then the government had to support them, the country had to support them and there had to be investment. There has been $2 billion worth of investment over the period since in the Australian shipping industry. It is a young fleet; its average age is about nine years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government wants in this legislation&mdash;no matter what the words are which come from the other side&mdash;is Australian ships off the coast, out of the business, and foreign ships in. That is what it wants. I warn those opposite, I warn them now: you do that, and you accept responsibility for a repetition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> incident, for the dangers you are going to create for the Australian coastal environment and in Australian ports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not being an alarmist. I will show you the figures from abroad. The European Commission&mdash;the largest shipping market in the world, with most of the maritime nations within it&mdash;has determined that the greatest danger to the coastal environment comes from substandard shipping. Why is substandard shipping there? Why does this government want it? It is because those organisations that operate substandard ships can get a 13&hyphen; to 15 per cent saving on operational costs by using those substandard ships and avoiding international safety obligations.</PARA>

We recommended in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame: A sequel</EMPHASIS> , which was released in December last year, that all single voyage permit vessels be inspected prior to loading cargo in this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A.P.J. Annand</EMPHASIS> was one of the worst ships ever to come to this coast. It had a single voyage permit and carried wheat for the Wheat Board.

The board does not carry out its obligations to ensure that the vessels it charters are up to international maritime safety standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will see more vessels like that. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nanda Rati</EMPHASIS> is one of them. Those vessels come here, and there is no way in the world that those sitting opposite can ensure that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has the required resources to carry out adequate inspections of all of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was one good thing in the favour of the member for Corangamite: he strongly supported the committee's report. I want the honourable member to assure us that he will stand by the recommendations of that report and make sure that these ships are not brought to our coast in that manner. You know what is involved. You have been a party to this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to BHP. BHP is dramatically disadvantaged by this legislation. It has made a commitment for a new vessel. Mackay Sugar has made a commitment for a special technically designed vessel for the loading and packaging of sugar. It will be affected by this legislation's retrospectivity. The retrospectivity was recognised by Senator Hill in the other place a few days ago on 20 May. He recognised Mr Justice Wells's judgment on retrospectivity. Senator Hill said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I am pretty much in accord with what you have read out, Senator.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not take up the time of the House by reading the rest of what is on page 701 of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . As Senator Bob Collins said on page 722 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> :</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">BHP, Shell and Mackay Sugar have all contracted the construction of very large and important vessels to the Australian fleet.</PARA>
<PARA>Mackay Sugar has a unique vessel. Mackay Sugar, which is in the electorate of Dawson, will be in diabolical trouble if this legislation gets through. Where are the National Party members? This is legislation put forward by a National Party minister. It is his legislation, but that is what the effect of it will be. I have not got time to read the rest of what Senator Collins said, but I recommend that members <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> read pages 701 and 722 of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Mr Hockridge, the manager of BHP Transport, was before the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee a few nights ago, he made the point that, even if the crew on your new Australian ship was free, if God had given you the crew and it did not cost you anything&mdash;and that would please a lot of people opposite no end&mdash;you still would not be competitive because a host of other factors are involved, and they are the financial factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the original legislation was designed, its aim was to give Australia's shipping owners and shipping operators the incentives that are available to our competitors. It was designed to try to put Australian shipping on a more even keel in relation to competitors abroad. To peddle the lie that somehow the PAYE grant will go to seafarers is something that I find obscene. It is dishonest and obscene.

He closed on the point that nobody should peddle the lie that the subsidies are being paid to seafarers. I am not going to repeat his statement because it is not worth repeating. The fact is that these subsidies are not being paid to seafarers; they are being paid to the company. We know why they are being paid to the company. It is because of the strife that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1026"> the previous Labor government got themselves into with ANL.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a deal struck with all the players involved at the time, but the deal is as good as. The previous Labor administration knew that they could not subsidise ANL straight out. They could not ask the taxpayers of Australia to directly pay the group tax for ANL. They had to inject it through the side door, and opposition members know that. That is the truth of the matter and that is part of what we are trying to address here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask members of the House this question: is there any other section of the Australian working community that taxpayers of Australia pay the PAYE tax for? The answer is no. That does not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all remember who the relevant minister was when this legislation was introduced, and we all remember the strife he got himself into after trying to deal with the problems of ANL. The former Prime Minister used to call him Dangerman. They brought in Turnbull and Wran to try to salvage the situation, and it got worse. Then, when they were trying to sell part of ANL off to get some money back in, they had to do a backdoor deal to try to stave off a revolt by the Maritime Union of Australia. At that time&mdash;and I remember this quite clearly&mdash;we saw in this place just who was controlling the Labor Party in government. They were being controlled by the ACTU and the Maritime Union of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to note that, at the time when this piece of legislation went through this place, the government agreed to pay that money. It might not have been a direct payment to the seafarers, but that was certainly the intention and that is where it went. That is what it was all about. I will quote from a press release from the Australian Taxpayers Association&mdash;the organisation that represents the taxpayers of Australia who have no choice in how they pay their group tax; it is deducted from their income and they make a contribution to the wellbeing of the Commonwealth. The headline was `Taxpayers lose in ANL deal'. The press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANL deal holds the Nation to ransom. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has signalled that the use of industrial muscle is a legitimate tactic and will be rewarded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers are the big losers in this deal because the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the former Labor government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has committed all other taxpayers (especially workers paying PAYE) to subsidise the ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no guaranteed end date and it commits all taxpayers to subsidise ANL for over $20 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the deal, the company gets to keep the PAYE instalments that would have been deducted from the seafarers wages, and the workers are exempt from income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal sets a dangerous precedent and flies in the face of the Federal Government's claim to champion competition, reform and opening Australia to the world.</PARA>
<PARA>The former Labor government maintained that, with the introduction of the Hilmer report, it was the champion of opening up competition and maintaining a level playing field. The former Prime Minister used to go to all parts of Australia and crow that it was the Labor Party that opened up all the markets in Australia to competition. They would not touch the labour market and they would not touch the marketplace where ANL operated. They would not touch the marketplace in which the Maritime Union of Australia operated. The Australian Taxpayers Association's press release states further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's an appalling situation when Australia can't give away the ANL (according to Lawrie Brereton), but it can afford to throw over $20 million each year of taxpayers' money at it `ad infinitum.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It gives a hollow ring to the claim that Australia's tax system is fair and equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and they are talking about the former Labor government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">must come clean and explain exactly how this proposal will work. What are the total costs? And what are net benefits&mdash;if any, to the whole community?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All taxpayers have the right to be treated fairly and equitably. This proposal distorts the tax system by excluding some workers and not others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also raises the possibility of further tax losses if other income is also free of income tax and may result in a future tax free wages push on ANL which further distorts the tax effect. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1027"> </PARA>
<PARA>This is the salient point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is the door now open for all struggling businesses to receive such tax benefits? Or is any group with sufficient power now able to have themselves excluded from the income tax net?</PARA>
<PARA>How many times do members in this place get representations from constituents in their electorates about businesses that have been struggling and, admittedly, have done the wrong thing and not remitted their group tax to the Australian Taxation Office within the 14 days or seven days required of them? They are then in trouble and the tax office takes them to court. That was not the case with ANL. The former Labor government headed off in the opposite direction. They gave them the assistance they needed whilst other businesses in Australia, which have found it difficult to remit group taxes collected within the required time, have ended up in court with the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill that we are debating this morning sets out to repeal the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995&mdash;that was the act I was just referring to&mdash;and to alter the sunset clause in the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 from 30 June 1997 to 30 June 1996. I think the requirements of this bill have been operating for 10 years. I understand that this bill was originally introduced by the member for Shortland, who was the minister at the time. The bill was intended to have effect for five years, but the former Labor government extended it for another five years, which takes us to 1997. This bill we are debating today requires that the sunset clause in that act be changed from 30 June 1997 to 30 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shipping serving Australia is both a major industry and a large contributor to Australia's current account deficit. In 1993-94, the cost of freight on Australia's external trade carried by sea was approximately $9.9 billion, with Australian shipping earning approximately $1.6 billion. The net cost of using foreign shipping in 1993&hyphen;94 was approximately $2.5 billion or 15 per cent of Australia's current account deficit in that year. In June 1995, there were approximately 30 Australian ships engaged in international trade.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian shipping faces greater costs than many other international operators. This results from the higher standard of Australian ships than those registered under flags of convenience, relatively high wage costs and relatively high crewing levels. The latter problem has been addressed through industry reforms, which saw the number of seafarers at the end of 1993-94 being 233 or eight per cent lower than at the end of 1992-93. Australian crewing levels are now close to international standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shipping industry receives a number of concessions, which are worth noting, including: the exemption of international shipping from many of the restrictive trade practices prohibited by the Trade Practices Act, the existence of cabotage which restricts most coastal trade to Australian ships, the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme, the Bass Strait passenger subsidies, an accelerated rate of depreciation for Australian trading ships, grants under the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act and grants under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act. As this bill deals with the two latter acts, they will be dealt with in more depth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act was introduced following negotiations on the proposed sale of the Australian National Line. The proposed sale of a substantial part of ANL was raised during debate on the appropriation bills in 1994. In August 1994, the government appointed a new board with the task of restructuring ANL&mdash;how many times did that happen?&mdash;after doubts were raised about the financial viability of ANL. The sale of ANL was subsequently endorsed by the ALP National Conference. In September 1994, members of the Labor government, the ACTU and the maritime unions met to discuss an industry reform package, which was designed to make ANL more attractive for sale. As part of the reform package, it was announced that grants would be paid to ship owners and operators to offset the impact of income tax on seafarers engaged in international shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1028"> The international shipping act was opposed by the then opposition. We were the then opposition and we voted against that legisla tion. Now that we are in government, this bill is moving to repeal that. The sale of ANL did not proceed. After various other potential buyers had dropped out, negotiations continued with the sole remaining potential buyer, P&amp;O. However, the sale of ANL to P&amp;O was strongly opposed by the MUA, which threatened industrial action unless P&amp;O gave certain assurances about crewing matters. Such assurances were not given and the former Labor government announced in December that the sale had been abandoned and that ANL would be restructured instead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many times did the Labor Party attempt to restructure ANL? How many millions of dollars worth of taxpayers' funds did the former Labor government pour down that black hole? It is outrageous. There has not been too much participation in this debate by the former minister who oversaw a lot of that. Some of the headlines at the time were `Dithering leaves ANL in dry dock'&mdash;I see that we have the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in the House now&mdash;and `Beazley defends ANL funding'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can remember at the time the very, very strong debate coming from the then government defending the money that was poured into ANL&mdash;the headline was `Secret funding deal in ANL sale'. There were some very interesting things which happened, and the Leader of the Opposition would recognise that, when Turnbull and the Minister for Transport at the time and company were negotiating the sale of the stevedoring component of ANL, they hived the profitable part off and kept the unprofitable part. We even got a lecture a little while ago from the member from Shortland about the reforms.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I have been over there as well and had a look at it. The member for Shortland referred to a lot of the privatisation that took place in Great Britain. But, in this process, the former Labor government desperately wanted to get rid of this dead cat that was strapped around its ankle called ANL, which it kept dragging into this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former minister was just dogged with bad luck over ANL and dogged with the bad luck that the Maritime Union of Australia brought to the debate because, instead of selling some of the profitable enterprises and agencies in Australia, the former government should have been getting rid of the unprofitable one and cutting their losses there. Yet the taxpayers are still subsidising it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then had the appointment of the new board&mdash;the appointment of some people, namely, Turnbull and Wran&mdash;to try to restructure ANL and get it up and going again. And who was Wran? We know who Wran was. He was one of the mates. But it did not happen and they did not achieve it; it just cost the taxpayers of Australia more money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of this bill addresses the Ships (Capital Grants) Act. The Ships (Capital Grants) Act was again introduced as part of the shipping reform program. The act provides for grants at the rate of seven per cent of the cost incurred in relation to registered Australian ships that are purchased as new ships&mdash;which is fair enough&mdash;purchased as ships less than five years old that have not previously been registered in Australia or extensively modified ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The capital grants act was introduced to facilitate the updating of the Australian shipping fleet to allow crewing to reflect international standards. It is a condition of all grants that the crewing of the ship in respect of which a grant is made does not exceed the maximum number fixed under the capital grants act. The capital grants act, as originally enacted, contained a sunset clause under section 9 which provided that grants would not be payable in respect of activity, that is, the purchase or modification of vessels, that occurred after 30 June 1992. The sunset clause was extended to 30 June 1997, and that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1029"> happened in 1990. My understanding was that it was the minister at the time who extended that. This bill proposes to bring the end date of that sunset clause back to 30 June 1996. It is interesting to note the number of speakers from the opposition on these bills.</PARA>

I acknowledge that the member for Throsby is in here talking about every single transport issue, particularly shipping, but we are not world competitive. The member for Shortland highlighted a number of reasons why we are not world competitive, but the Labor Party in government had 13 years to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before the House this morning is principally to repeal the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act and to alter the sunset clause in the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. The first act that it is going to repeal contained that arrangement that was made by the former Labor government to prop up ANL at the time, and it obviously has not worked. We have seen Australian taxpayers continue to pour an enormous amount of money into that government enterprise that is not profitable. We have seen the former Labor government over the years that it was in office sell lots of government business enterprises that were profitable. They sold the profitable ones and kept the unprofitable ones. The minister at the time, Mr Brereton, acknowledged at one stage that you probably could not give ANL away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the interests of the taxpayers of Australia are being acknowledged by this bill and that we recognise that we have a responsibility to try to address, in a responsible way, what we inherited with regard to the size of the budget deficit. The coalition strongly opposed the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Bill when it was debated in the parliament last October.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme was developed from the deal made by the former Prime Minister and his senior ministerial colleagues with the ACTU <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the Maritime Union of Australia to end the shipping strike called by the Maritime Union of Australia over the sale of ANL Ltd and ANL shareholding in Australian Stevedores. For its part of the bargain, the Maritime Union of Australia undertook to give serious consideration to supporting the government's proposed sale of ANL and negotiating an industrial agreement with shipowners to deliver significant cost savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The MUA opposed the sale tooth and nail and forced the government to back off from selling the line to P&amp;O. That was the end result. The former Labor government did the deal to subsidise the company and pay PAYE tax. In the end, they did not achieve anything because the MUA still would not let the government of the time sell ANL to P&amp;O, the only prospective buyer. Needless to say, ANL made further losses which continued to be a drain on the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The so&hyphen;called maritime industry restructuring agreement was duly negotiated and was supposed to produce cost savings of some $200,000 per ship per year. However, the Maritime Union of Australia has largely failed to deliver on its commitments with the result that the promised savings have simply evaporated. The result of these measures that are being introduced and debated today is that Australian taxpayers will save about $52 million over the next four years. We inherited a fairly despicable sort of budget situation from the former Labor government&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to intervene briefly in this debate basically because, while the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill has not necessarily attracted a great deal of public attention to this time, we are a maritime nation both in terms of our trade and our national security. We are also a maritime nation in terms of our social amenity, as most of our population lives on the coast. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1030"> environmental issues entailed in the way we pursue maritime policy are also important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what the previous speaker, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), thinks he is going to do with ANL at the present time, but I can tell him exactly what he would be able to do with ANL if this bill were to pass and if he were to get the way of his minister on the subject of cabotage. I suspect that cabotage will be dealt with in the not too distant future in a related bill. What he will be able to do then with ANL is take out the Australian Navy and provide them with sorrowful target practice on the way to the bottom, because there is absolutely nothing else you will be able to do with the remnants of that organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill and the other propositions that this government is pursuing render our maritime industry null and void. This is the death knell of the Australian maritime industry. It does not matter what clever game the government thinks it is playing in this area, this is a manifestation of prejudice, in the form of policy, to the great detriment of the national interest. It is not as though it is being done to an industry which has exhibited great strength; it is not as though it is being done to an industry that is otherwise than in strict survival mode.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the United Kingdom went through this process in the late 1970s under the influence of the Thatcher government, we witnessed the destruction of the greatest civil maritime nation in the world. The British used to say that their diminution in international standing was a product of the loss of empire and the consequences of their having to fight two wars that were enormously economically debilitating to that nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever happened with their empire and those wars, it did not happen to the British maritime industry. What happened to the British maritime industry was Maggie Thatcher. They have gone from a point where they had some 2,000 ships plying international trade down to about 200 now. That is the position they got into. They were very lucky during the Falklands War that that depredation had not proceeded so far that they were in the position of having no ships to fight <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with. They were very lucky to catch it at that early point. If they had to fight that war over again, they would be in a materially more difficult position than they were in then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the information of the previous speaker, it was not a product of privatisation; it was a product of the removal of precisely these sorts of financial supports to the British system. The Europeans paid no such attention to that sort of nonsense. The Europeans, with whom our international traders compete internationally, have these sorts of financial arrangements and more. They rigidly adhere to cabotage around the European coastline and, on the basis of all that, they produce a massive maritime industry. They have sustained it against the depredations of flag of convenience countries. They have survived on the basis of that and they maintain their maritime position through cabotage and these sorts of support mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not about creating an even playing field; this is about destroying the last vestiges of the playing field on which our international shippers can play&mdash;and they are not thanking you for this initiative. Your hatred of the seamen and the MUA is all very well when you are standing on the barricades and waving your flags, but it does not sit very well with the poor devils who are employers&mdash;the people who are out there trying to make a quid, assist our balance of payments problems and trying to ensure that Australia maintains a maritime industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote from Robert Hartley, the Manager of Maritime Policy for the Australian Shipowners Association. They are used to dealing with the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in this area and they have a kindly view of him. He has been trailing around their offices for years being educated by them. But they did not comprehend that education does not necessarily cure prejudice; it merely gives it a wider stage. This matter has provided this minister with a wider stage. He has read everything, knows everything and understands nothing. So they said gently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister, Mr Sharp, has expressed a belief that under the coalition plan for an Australian second register and dismantling of cabotage, the increased <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1031"> competitive environment will rejuvenate shipping and lead to an expansion in the Australian flag fleet.</PARA>
<PARA>The ambition for a healthy, expanded fleet is admirable and we shall endeavour to see whether it can be made to work. In the meantime Australian shipowners have to carry on business as usual, which indeed they will do, until competition from foreign government assisted shipping with cheaper Third World crews makes the business of running Australian flag and crewed ships in international trade uneconomical. In the current hiatus new investment in Australian tonnage is already being put on hold. I understand that there are some three ships to which this will apply retrospectively, in effect. It is a massive breach of faith with the Australian shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And haven't they ever performed? Since those reforms were put in place in the waterfront in the mid-1980s, some $2 billion worth of investment has gone into the Australian shipping industry, and that was in a very short time. As I said before, it is an industry which we cling to with our fingernails. What a gesture of confidence for people who understand that they have to operate in an international environment where you have flag of convenience crews operating and where the employers of those flag of convenience crews do not care whether their ships sink or float, provided they can make a quid out of it at the optimal opportunity!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian shipping industry are competing with them. They are probably taking on board a greater challenge than any other section of Australian industry. They put $2 billion into it on the basis of the changes that were made by the Maritime Union in relation to the crewing arrangements of ships. Those changes were enforced, taking crew numbers down from something like 31 a ship to 18 a ship&mdash;enforced by their willingness to acquire, or repair or refurbish the sorts of ships that could sustain that crewing level. So the crew numbers went down from 31 to 18 and $2 billion was invested. We have the advantage, therefore, of having a shipping industry that is approximately half the age of the international average&mdash;in other words, a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shipping industry capable of delivering a substantial performance outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as though those reforms of crewing levels have not been accompanied by other reforms on the waterfront. For example, in the handling of bulk cargoes we have had an improvement of 60 per cent over this period. The national average cost of loading or unloading containers declined by 29 per cent in the early 1990s. Competition passed these gains on to shippers in the form of lower freight rates and higher trade, with the BTCE estimating the total benefit to all shippers in 1993 at $276 million, of which $200 million accrued to Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, sustaining its attack on the MUA, of course now seeks to pooh-pooh those sorts of figures and suggests their irrelevance. Yet every day or every month new agreements for better practice on the waterfront are being reached. There is a total awareness, as far as that industry is concerned, of its need to improve its performance constantly. But one thing they all agree is the central thing for improvement in productivity&mdash;be they stevedoring companies, shippers, the workers in the industry or those who use that industry&mdash;is the capacity of the companies engaged in the process to refurbish that industry, to provide it with capital infrastructure which modernises it. That is absolutely critical to the improvement in productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same way as work practices are ignored by this government as the central problem in the stevedoring industry, the government also ignores the fact that in the shipping industry the central problem in productivity is the lack of investment in the capital infrastructure. It is even more important that those investment decisions are taken in order to give us a chance of being internationally competitive at all. So not only does our Australian shipping industry have to compete with those flag of convenience crews, but also it has to compete with the well subsidised, well supported European, American and Japanese fleets. It is not as though it necessarily does it terribly well in this sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, it clings by its fingernails to its capacity to provide a service to us. For <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1032"> example, Australian resident operators' freight on imports and exports is worth just over $1&half; billion a year, or about 13.7 per cent of the total. Foreign operators are now at $10.5 billion, about 86 per cent of the total. So, as I said, the industry is clinging to it by its fingernails, but that has a tremendously important impact upon our balance of payments. If you take that $1&half; billion out and add to it about $600 million worth of trade on the coast, if that subsequently gets done by foreign crews, you punch a $2 billion hole in the balance of payments position&mdash;because of this piece of arrant arrogance and stupidity, this breach of faith with the shipowners of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said before that there are other factors involved in this. I mentioned environmental factors. If you start to build up a flag of convenience crew ship operation around our coastline&mdash;we already have it, of course, in the international shipping arrangements&mdash;in a very short time you will start to get a threat to the major tourist industries of this nation. Most of those major tourist industries lie on the coast of this country, and most of them lie on the north-east coast of this country. Those areas will be where surveillance is at its worst by virtue of their distance from population centres. It will take just one or two savage accidents in those areas and the tourism industry there will shut down. In taking ourselves out of the maritime industry&mdash;as this legislation would do&mdash;we would be removing a whole basis of expertise on surveillance anyway as far as these sorts of areas are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned too the issue of national security. There is a very interesting statistic again involving some investment by shipowners that the government has taken upon itself to persecute. There are memoranda of understanding between the defence department and our seven major shipowners. They cover around 40 ships to provide assistance in case of a national emergency. A number of those shipowners have, at their own expense, fitted ship&hyphen;to&hyphen;ship refuelling facilities and other modifications specifically to assist the navy. Australia's defence forces depended on merchant seamen for emergency manning in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> both world wars, and during the Falklands War the Royal Navy was able to rely on 53 ships from 24 different companies for troop transport, communications and supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was defence minister, I directly experienced what all this meant. You might well say that that is out there in the distant never&hyphen;never and not to worry about that sort of thing. We decided to finally test a division in the north of Australia. We decided to mobilise that division by taking it essentially from the south&hyphen;east and western corners and putting it in the north in a timely way&mdash;the sort of response time we would need in international conflict&mdash;and to supply it. It was as heavy a division as we normally provide. There were tanks, artillery and other heavy weapons associated with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of it had to be carried up the Stuart Highway. We discovered from that that, grateful though the Northern Territory government was that we were spending that much money in the Northern Territory and that they were getting a bit of attention in an area that interests them&mdash;defence&mdash;they were not grateful that the tourists who plied the Stuart Highway found themselves locked into slow&hyphen;moving convoys with tank transporters proceeding in front of them. They did not enjoy the experience. They had a very substantial look at the exhaust pipes of a number of very interesting heavy transporters but, apart from that, they had less enjoyment than they could normally expect to get from the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, even with all of that, one-third of that division's supplies had to be sent by sea. One-third of the supplies to sustain an Australian effort in the field had to be sent by sea. The notion that we could do that without an Australian maritime industry is laughable. I am not talking about sending Australians to do anything in Papua New Guinea or anywhere else. I am talking about sending Australians inside Australia to do things inside Australia for the defence of Australia. That is what we are talking about here. One-third of the supplies had to go by sea, and that was a very generous interpretation of what it was that we had to do. In fact, it would have been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1033"> a great deal more efficient to send a lot more by sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I once had the pleasure of discussing the relative merits of sea transport against other forms of transport for defence purposes with a chap who headed the NATO command for the area adjacent to Europe. It is the only NATO command not commanded by an American. It is commanded by a Britisher for auld lang syne. It is commanded by him because of Britain's once great reputation in the maritime area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said to him, `This is all a bit out of date, isn't it, Admiral? These days you could send all this by air transport.' He said, `Well, let me tell you this, sport'&mdash;he did not actually use that expression but called me `Minister'&mdash;`if you took 20 of the biggest American army freighter planes'&mdash;I think a Starlifter or a Galaxy; it was one or the other&mdash;`and flew them end to end 24 hours a day for 10 years, you would provide sufficient ammunition for war on the central front for six weeks. That is what you would do if you rendered yourselves reliant upon air transport. That's why we like to keep sea lanes open, Minister. It's the only way the Americans can get here.' That was an interesting demonstration again of the absolute significance of the maritime industries to the national security of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this bill is no joke. This little piece of revenge on the MUA is massively destructive of our balance of payments, massively destructive of Australian industry, massively destructive of our national defence and potentially massively destructive of our marine environment. This minister is a classic. This sort of semi-educated minister in his portfolio jumped the starter's gun. He got that starter's gun when they swore him in a couple of days after the election and, instead of holding the darned starter's gun in the air, he pointed it at his foot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he has been doing with that starter's gun ever since is pointing it at the foot of Australian industry&mdash;be it in the railway area or be it in the absurd set of propositions we are now left with at Sydney airport. Having failed to bite the bullet on the privatisation of Sydney airport at the appropriate time and get <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a bunch in place at Sydney airport with an obligation on them to develop a second airport out at Badgerys Creek&mdash;that is what was entailed in that privatisation proposition&mdash;those opposite squibbed it for the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and have found themselves wandering around in never-never land ever since. The great micro-economic reform task that was in place to fix up the aviation industry in Sydney has been wrecked. The great task of keeping us in the Australian maritime industry, an industry absolutely vital for the national security of this nation, is in the process of being wrecked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is an exorable bill that requires rejection by this parliament. Above all, it is a bill that requires the understanding of this parliament. It is a bill that really needs to sink into the minds of the Australian citizen, because the Australian citizen accepts too readily the notion that we are a maritime nation without seeing the evidence of it and without necessarily seeing what is required to keep us in that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in it only by the very skin of our teeth. We are in it only by the sorts of propositions that are being rejected here today. We are in it only because our government was prepared to create a level playing field and take away the impediments to maintenance of an effective maritime industry&mdash;be it the reforms necessary in the labour market or the reforms necessary in support mechanisms for our shipowners via the taxation system. We did no more for that industry than has been done by the European nations to support theirs and we did a great deal less for it than has been done by the United States to support theirs, but what little we did is now being removed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the bill itself, it is clear that the previous Labor government bribed the maritime unions of Australia so as to encourage the sale of ANL because the owners were being held to ransom by the union. What is new about that with the union movement in Australia? There is no doubt in my mind that they were attempting to sweeten the sale of ANL. Of course, not only were they attempting to sweeten the sale of ANL, but you might note that, in the original bill, there was a sunset clause finishing the Ships (Capital <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Grants) Act in 1990. But of course the sunset clause was extended to 30 June 1997. It is fairly clear that this is about looking after the Labor Party mates in the maritime unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maritime unions have a great reputation in Australia, and I have had some interesting letters in the last few weeks about this. We should look back in history to see the record of some of these people and their cousins in the Waterside Workers Federation and to see what they have done to Australia over the years.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">About 28th May, 1945 I was instructed by my Commanding Officer (CO) for the 2/27 Battalion 7th Division AIF to proceed from Atherton (Atherton Tablelands) to Townsville. I was to supervise the loading of a ship allocated to us to once more service overseas. My CO advised me that the ship had to be loaded by the 1st June, with our equipment, or else I would have to answer to him personally. That was something I would have preferred not to have to do. On the other hand if I upset the Waterside Workers I would face a Court Martial because they would go on strike there and possibly through Australia.

I sought <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1035"> out the Foreman and was informed that it was their morning tea break. After 20 minutes or so they went outside to load the ship. Approximately 10 to 15 minutes later they were back in the shed. I again spoke to the Foreman who informed me that they could not work in the rain, as they didn't have their wet weather gear there. When I told him about the troops conditions in the tropics with rain, mud etc, he said that it was not his problem. I asked him again to proceed with loading the ship, not when it's raining he replied. It was not raining hard enough to get wet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I asked him if I could use his phone which was hanging on the wall. He said "yes". I told him that seeing his Wharfies were not loading the ship on time I would get some Army Engineers in to do so. I went to the phone and pretended to speak to the CO for the Engineers Unit. The Foreman said my "blokes" will throw the Engineers in the Harbour.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Foreman then replied that they would go on a general strike throughout Australia. Oh boy! A rock and a hard place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wharfies then loaded the ship without any further trouble and in good time. As a result the loading was completed before the Battalion, approximately 1,000 men, arrived and embarked on the 2nd June, 1945.</PARA>
<PARA>That was what they were prepared to do in the war when our men were being killed in New Guinea. When young men&mdash;my uncles&mdash;who were only 17 years old were up there fighting for Australia, the waterside workers and the maritime unions of Australia were not prepared to back the country. That is the type of people that the Labor Party are defending. There is no doubt that we have to try to find efficiencies in Australia. When I say to you that it is important to the export industries of this country, I mean it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia, despite the $300 million to $400 million that has been thrown at the problems <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by the Labor Party over the years, still has not reached world standard. We are still way below world standard in these areas. Export industries are being asked to play on a level playing field. How can you possibly play on a level playing field when you have one hand tied behind your back by the Waterside Workers Union of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member interjected: `Have you ever met a waterside worker?' Yes, I have met a waterside worker. I have had them drink in my pub. I have had them fly back to the electorate from all parts of the world first-class. That is the standard they set and the costs they enforce on the industry. I have heard these people skite about how they get the income they want by holding industries to ransom. That is the type of thing we have had happen in Australia and the type of thing we have to break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one would agree that we should accept so-called `rust buckets'. No-one would agree that we should have people paid below the reasonable wage for working on these ships. That has to be addressed; I agree. But at present, when Australia is trying to compete on the world market, we are not competitive. I recall vividly some two to three years ago when Australia was trying to sell some wheat to New Zealand that the New Zealanders bought the wheat from the Middle East. The reason they bought the wheat from the Middle East is that it was cheaper to ship that wheat from the Middle East to New Zealand than to ship Australian wheat from Australia to New Zealand. Why? Because of the costs of our wharves, the costs of our maritime unions. That is the problem we have in this country and the problem that must be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our great agricultural industries are battling to compete on the world market. If you look closely at the costs out of the New Zealand ports, the costs of maritime unions in New Zealand and the costs out of the United States of America&mdash;who are our prime competitors in the markets we have in South&hyphen;East Asia&mdash;you find they are beating us hands down. Even though the Australian Labor Party has thrown $300 million to the waterside workers and said `Put this in your pockets', it has achieved very little. We are nowhere near the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1036"> efficiency of ports like Singapore and Antwerp&mdash;the ports we are competing with. That is why we have to address these problems. We have to address the industrial relations legislation as well if we are to become competitive.</PARA>

We understand that pure economics do not work out there in the big world, but you have to have the competition. You must be efficient. The members of the Labor Party are laughing about this. I notice they do not represent many rural electorates in Australia. Even the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has left them. He is up here on the benches with the Independents. Australian agricultural industries by any measure on their home soil are the most efficient industries in the world, but they are hobbled by the costs of exporting and the costs of the industrial relations laws in this country in many of the value adding factories across the nation. These areas must be addressed. You cannot say on the one hand to the agricultural industries of Australia, `You must abide by the laws of Hilmer', but on the other hand say: `We cannot do this to our mates in the maritime unions. They pay towards our election.' We have to cover all these areas if we are going to get these efficiencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The sale of ANL is interesting. Having come from the state parliament of New South Wales I have known a few of the players who have ended up here. I dare say that I followed them here. One that I know very well&mdash;and I will quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 8 November 1994&mdash;was the former minister, Mr Laurie Brereton. An article I have here by Laura Tingle, headed `Secret funding deal in ANL sale', says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Laurie Brereton was attending the funeral of murdered New South Wales MP John Newman on September 9 and was also 24 hours into the most <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> serious maritime strike of the past decade when Malcolm Turnbull rang him on his mobile telephone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turnbull told the Minister for Transport a rather substantial problem had come up in Brereton's secret plan to push through a deal that same day to sell Australian Stevedores&mdash;the prime asset of the government owned shipping line, ANL Ltd, but also the jealously guarded domain of the maritime unions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The buyer, Chris Corrigan's corporate cashbox Jamison Equity Ltd, didn't have the money at call to do the $28 million deal. It only had $5.6 million immediately to hand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turnbull sought Brereton's agreement that ANL&mdash;the capital&hyphen;starved, loss&hyphen;making shipping line which Brereton had claimed the previous month was a financial wreck&mdash;would lend Jamison the $22.4 million needed to complete the transaction.</PARA>
<PARA>Rather interesting. Earlier we heard the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) talking about Neville Wran. Of course, Neville Wran is the partner of Malcolm Turnbull, and here they are doing deals with the former Labor government. What's new? I wonder what the deal really was.

There is no doubt that the only reason that the Labor Party members are here in strength defending this piece of legislation is that it was brought in as a bribe to the maritime unions, their mates who fund them. That is all they are interested in; they certainly are not interested in the future of Australia, and they certainly are not interested in the fact that we must be a competitive trading nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are ever going to get away from the financial mess that this country is in, we really have to be able to trade our way out of it. It worried me some 18 months ago to read headlines referring to Australia having the best balance of trade result in 15 years while, because of the interest on the debt, we were still not in front. That is the legacy of the Labor Party: a foreign debt blow&hyphen;out from something like $28 billion to $184 billion. The former government dishonestly told this House last year that it was going to have a budget surplus, only to come back later in the year to say that it had got it wrong. Even after the creative accounting of putting Victoria's debt repayment into the current account, the former government still claimed to have a surplus of $150 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I clearly remember the surplus figure being challenged during the election campaign when Labor Party leaders such as Mr Carr stood up and swore on oath, in blood, that it was correct, but they were prepared to throw Australian taxpayers' money to the wind to try and hide the unemployment figures in an effort to win. Now, of course, the Australian people have been left with an $8 billion black hole that has to be somehow filled.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to do that, sir, because I know of your genuine concerns for the future of this country. Let me start with the basic premise that all governments over the last two decades, whatever their political composition, have been dedicated to the proposition that, in the defence of Australia, we have to have armed services which are self&hyphen;reliant so that, if we enter a regional dispute where we are not necessarily going to be able to be assisted by someone else, we have a capacity to defend ourselves. Self&hyphen;reliance became the touchstone of our defence policy, irrespective of which governments were in office. No&hyphen;one can argue that there have not been historical industrial problems on our waterfront, and I am not doing that either; nor do I say that all the fault and all the blame are on one side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I hear the kinds of references made to Australian <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">merchant seamen, it is odd that people opposite, who like to wrap themselves in the flag of patriotism on Anzac Day, cannot even simply acknowledge that there were merchant seamen who put their lives on the line time and time again to see that necessary supplies got to Australia and got to our armed forces&mdash;and many of them lost their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that to balance the picture. We are, after all, the largest island continent in the world. Think about that. If you are the largest island continent in the world, you not only need a navy, but you need a merchant navy. You need a merchant navy which is an integral part of the economic fabric and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> structure of your nation. It is the job of government, irrespective of its political complexion, to see that, if you are going to be self&hyphen;reliant with your armed services, there are many pieces of equipment that they need. Australian manufacturing industry needs to import all sorts of component parts, not merely for defence equipment, but for everyday living. We are a nation that lives on our exports. So do we not need to follow the pattern that is occurring in Asia&mdash;in Singapore and Malaysia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), a former distinguished minister in this area, has pointed out the significance of the maritime industry when seen as a total industry for the economic development of any country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subsidy is going to BHP, you great dill. They are putting in lots of money to build a ship which is very relevant and very important not merely to their company but to Australian pastoralists involved in the sugar industry. That is the reality. You might not like the reality. You would rather be governed by your prejudice. That is part of the problem that we have with this government on this issue. With apologies to Puccini: their tiny minds are frozen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot and you must not proceed with this legislation. It is against the future of Australia and its future generations, it is against the interests of small manufacturers right throughout Australia who play a legitimate role in providing supplies that go into our shipbuilding industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have you no sense of national pride? Do you think we should not be competing with China, Singapore or Malaysia? What is the answer? The answer is a dopey minister driven by prejudice who says, `The easy way of solving this problem for me, so I can get back to the farm on the weekend, is to scrap the lot.' I say: scrap the lot and the Australian people will never forgive you because there will inevitably come a time when, as in the past, we have had to rely on our merchant seamen on our own and by ourselves. We cannot afford to have one policy in terms of our armed services and another policy which is the policy of self&hyphen;reliance for the construction of ships and for the proper and adequate training of young Australians to man them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an unemployment problem in this country and you do not solve that when you withdraw subsidies from an area providing jobs for skilled workers. It is not just at the level of going to sea; it is in the building and manufacturing industry and the pastoral industry. It is relevant to every aspect of Australian life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not sell out your future. When a report is handed down by a parliamentary committee whose members have agreed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1041"> unanimously to it, that says clearly and strongly that there is no future in any of us relying on international trade being carried by the rust buckets from around the world. I would hope that a sense of national pride and a sense of commitment would cause this government to pause, withdraw this legislation and have a big think again. I tell you: what you are doing now will bode very badly in the length and breadth of Australia&mdash;not just in my electorate of Melbourne Ports, but right throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Go back to your electorates and find out the extent to which small manufacturers, pastoralists and others will ultimately have their future determined by the quality and the efficiency of an Australian shipping industry. It is not beyond our imagination or our capacity. It is not even beyond the capacity of this government to now withdraw this legislation and think again. This is a disastrous policy that you are pursuing and, if you continue to pursue it, there will be future generations which, I assure you, will live to regret it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the speakers from the government asked: why are there so many opposition members speaking on this legislation? I will answer that question: it is because we believe passionately in this country and we believe passionately in the future of the maritime industry of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did take exception when the member for Page (Mr Causley) said that we in the Labor Party were not interested in the future of Australia. Let me tell him that I have been on the transport committee of this House now for eight or 10 years. I have spent endless hours working, bringing down unanimous reports from all sides&mdash;even from committees with some National Party members on them. I mention just a few: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>, the sequel to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>, reports on railways, and also <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to wharf</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> From listening to the honourable member for Page, it appears that he is in a time warp. He seems to think that, if you take all the waterside workers in Australia, line them up against the wall and shoot them, all our problems will be solved. If he knew absolute ly anything about the waterside, he would know that the waterside workers are only one link in a whole chain. Other links in that chain are some of his mates, the forwarding agents and people responsible for the receiving of goods, and so on, whose delays put additional costs on Australian shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the honourable member for Page appears to be in a time warp&mdash;and time warp is right. He relied on the reading of a letter in which someone told him that in 1945 the Maritime Union held up the loading of a ship and did not help in Australia's war effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell the honourable member for Page something about the waterside workers of Australia: at about that time&mdash;in fact, a few years earlier&mdash;at a place called Port Kembla, when the then conservative government under one Bob Menzies was shipping out pig-iron to the Japanese to be fired back at our troops, it was the waterside workers at Port Kembla who saved hundreds of Australian lives by stopping that pig&hyphen;iron from being shipped out. Incidentally, that was where old Bob Menzies got the name Pig Iron Bob&mdash;and a well&hyphen;deserved name it was too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Page also talked about the Maritime Union at the time of the war not being interested in the future of Australia. Off his electorate and other electorates along the east and west coasts of Australia, but in particular along the east coast, there lie over 140 merchant ships at the bottom of the sea and the seafarers which went with them. The honourable member for Page was saying that the seafarers were unpatriotic. They were patriotic enough to give their lives for this country, and today they lie in their watery graves to prove it. If the honourable member is locked in a time warp, let us bring him a little up to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation we are debating today is likely to be the most ideologically driven that the government will introduce during its terms of office as it gives expression to its hatred of the Maritime Union of Australia. It is legislation based on prejudice, ignorance and hatred. This hatred of the Maritime Union of Australia will greatly damage the Australian shipping industry. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1042">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the maritime unions and the people in the Labor Party who are opposed to this legislation. As other members have said, BHP, the big Australian, among others in the shipping industry, is bucking at the repeal by this bill of the Ships (Capital Grants) Act and the International Shipping (Australia&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BHP and other major shipping operators have warned the Government that the abolition of these measures will leave the industry in limbo and place Australia at a severe disadvantage in the international community.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought, really, that this was a government that had a good relationship with the business community. The International Shipping (Australia&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Act provides a taxable grant to the ship operator&mdash;and I repeat: to the ship operator. Haven't you people read the legislation? You come in here and talk about a grant to the Maritime Union. It has nothing to do with the Maritime Union; it is a grant to the ship operator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that you opposed the legislation last year when it was introduced. Now the minister, in a fit of ignorance, describes it simply as yet another rort for the Maritime Union for Australia. That ignorance is paraded time and time again every time someone from the government side gets up to speak. If this is the case, why is it that the shipping industry is so up in arms? Why are shipping operators saying to the government in meetings at the highest level not to repeal this legislation because it will leave Australian industry in limbo and place us at a severe disadvantage internationally?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look, stop this nonsense about it coming from the Maritime Union. The idea came from the shipping industry itself. It is the same as applies in many other parts of the world. You would think that Australia was the only place that had this. It applies in many other parts of the world. You know and the fact is that, if the minister and the government put aside their ideologically driven bent for just a moment, these measures address aspects of the non-level playing field against Australian shipowners whose cost structures include the adoption and application of important international maritime conventions concerning <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> safety and ship standards. Compare this to our international competitors who have access to flags of convenience ships and second register crews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike Australian shipowners, such international competitors have access to fiscal advantages provided through direct assistance by their own governments&mdash;flags of convenience registration in countries with little or no taxation or ship safety requirements applying, access to cheap and untrained labour, a failure to adopt international shipping conventions on safety and environmental responsibility, and all of the associated costs involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The repeal of the measures in these acts seriously and unnecessarily undermines a viable and critical Australian industry. The immediate effect of the repeal of these acts will be an increase in cost to the Australian international shipping industry. In 1996-97 these increases in costs are expected to be about $27 million. To revoke the accelerated depreciation and the Ships (Capital Grants) Act would equate to a 23 per cent increase in capital costs or 15 per cent in the total cost per ship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1989 over $2 billion has been committed to investment in ships, with the result that the Australian fleet is half the age of the world fleet. This investment, by the admission of the Chief Executive of the Australian Shipowners Association, Lachlan Payne, is now under threat. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS> of 2 May, Mr Payne stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Projects will be stalled, or shelved because of uncertainty. The international shipping market characterised by fleets subject to government measures of one kind or another . . . and there are a wide variety of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is fallacious to believe Australian shipping can compete internationally without some government measures, which are applied by other countries as a matter of choice . . . to compete Australian shipping needs measures such as those the Government is now repealing.</PARA>
<PARA>These are very damming words for the minister. This is not, by the admission of the government's own supporters in the business community, a rort for the MUA: it is critical to the wellbeing of the Australian shipping <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1043"> industry. They are pleading with you to leave these measures alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not fashionable these days, especially when trying to justify an impending attack on the MUA, as the government is at the moment, to remind the House that over the last decade due to reforms implemented by the previous government shipowners and workers have made significant gains in productivity and competitiveness. Average ship crew sizes dropped from 33 in 1983 to 18 in 1986. This represents a reduction in crew sizes of 45 per cent without one day's delay due to industrial disputes. Further, the minister in his second reading speech conceded that these manning levels are consistent with international standards. No matter what the minister says on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Sunday</EMPHASIS> or in question time, he has put the facts in black and white on page 182 of the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 1 May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial disputes hit their lowest level in 10 years in 1992&hyphen;93 when only 23 ship days were lost due to crew disputes. No-one would deny that dealing with the shipping industry and the waterfront are easy questions, but nor does all wisdom lie on one side. What I and the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) find disappointing from those opposite, not only in this debate but over many years, is that they have given no credit to the significant reforms made to Australian shipping regarding levels of crewing and multiskilling, and indeed on the waterfront itself.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MARTIN" NAMEID="8I4">

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to that. Australia, as an island continent, is more dependent on shipping than most. There are defence implications and security implications, so why should we put all our imports at the mercy of the foreign masters?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also an amount of ignorance on all sides regarding the waterfront and shipping. I wonder how many members on the other side have actually talked to someone from the Maritime Union or visited the waterfront. I know that on many occasions I have extended to the minister an invitation to come to Port Kembla. Some years ago the Port Kembla <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> harbour task force worked out a scheme whereby people involved in the waterfront could visit farmers in the central west of New South Wales, stay in their homes and see first&hyphen;hand some of the problems they are facing. We all admit that people on the land have problems. The reverse was that the farmers could come and stay with people involved in the Maritime Union at Port Kembla and see first&hyphen;hand some of their problems. This led to considerable understanding between the two groups, because they both understood that one side was not totally right and that all wisdom did not lie on one side. So they realised that both sides had difficulties. It is a pity that does not happen more often.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now is not the time&mdash;if ever there is a time&mdash;to attack the shipping industry that has made so much progress in restructuring simply to satisfy this government's manic hatred of the Maritime Union and its membership. The port of Kembla is in the centre of my electorate and, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS> of 2 May, has had its best month's trading, with imports and exports reaching almost three million tonnes. The reasons for this impressive record are the improvements in BHP tonnage, the best month for the Port Kembla coal loader in three years and good grain exports through the Port Kembla grain terminal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This strong performance reflects Port Kembla's capacity to handle cargo in excess of 30 million tonnes per year. I am proud of the fact that in my electorate Port Kembla harbour is set to become one of the most dynamic, efficient and best performing ports on the east coast of Australia. But this government wants to put all this progress at risk, so unnecessarily. The repeal of these acts will have a negative effect on the current account deficit; marine insurance; towage and pilotage; the development and supply of shipping technology; ship management and repairs. There are three vessels under construction at the moment, and they were to be delivered this fiscal year. The unnecessary repeal of these acts will see direct and unplanned increases in the cost of construction. BHP Transport, Shell Australia, and Mackay <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1044"> Refined Sugars will be retrospectively penalised as a result. And I thought you were the people who hated retrospectivity!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current measures have the support of BHP, the Australian Shipowners Association and other operators in the industry. These organisations have told the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that these measures are necessary for the viability of the industry. They have warned the government that the industry will be placed in limbo. Investment planning will dry up, and the international community will avoid Australia again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reported that shipowners have suspended some $250 million in planned investment in new tonnage. I am particularly concerned that the government is floating the idea of a second shipping register. Despite how the government might dress this up, a second register is nothing more than a convenient way for shipowners to not meet their legal requirements of shipping. The legal requirements in respect of crew levels, crew competence and safety measures will be able to be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us who worked on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report know how one must be ever vigilant to foreign shipping coming into Australia. This move will open the Australian coastline to rust buckets of the world. The difficulty is that many of them, under the government's proposal, will now be registered in Australia. What we will see is ships on the Australian run with perhaps Australian officers, but a crew from Third World nations, paid Third World wages and working under Third World conditions. Make no mistake, the result of the second register in Australia will be poorly trained crews, the loss of safety conditions and the real possibility of disastrous maritime accidents with a pollution bill running into millions of dollars which taxpayers will be required to pick up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Avid readers of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS> will be aware of the regular reports which that paper carries of the trials and tribulations experienced by foreign crews aboard flags of convenience ships. It details how they are not paid and gives descriptions of their working <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conditions, abuses, malnutrition, health problems, injuries and deaths. On 9 May the paper reported that 11 Chinese sailors had fled a Taiwanese fishing trawler anchored in Wellington saying that they were beaten and whipped for more than five months at sea. These Chinese allege that they were beaten with sticks and whips embedded with fish hooks. Most had injuries and a number were treated at Wellington Hospital. The sailors were promised pay of $164 a month, but they only received $120.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is this what the crowd opposite want? This is what we are going to get on the Australian coastline. The honourable member for Page asked me how many of these ships there are. He should read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS>. Between 18 and 25 ships are detained a month. I have an arrangement to go down and look at every ship that is detained in Port Kembla. The honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) comes with me. We look at those ships and try to board them. Usually we are not allowed to go aboard them. We have seen those ships. We have spoken to the seafarers not only at Port Kembla but also in other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not come into this chamber and say that this happens only occasionally. It is happening every day on the Australian coastline. This is what those opposite want as the norm for Australia. Australian seafarers are the best trained in the world. It always amazes me that some shipowners or cargo owners want to put their cargo in the hands of untrained, inexperienced crews. There are many reasons why we should proudly keep an Australian owned and operated as well as Australian crewed shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those calling for the introduction of foreign flag ships in Australia, disguise it how they may, are advocating tax avoidance. The huge advantage that these owners have over Australian shipowners is that they pay little or no tax. They are not smarter or better; they just do not have the tax burdens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Foreign flags are cheaper because they do not pay tax, but that is no reason to import them into our domestic economy. The argument that this would lead to a competitive balance between Australian flagships and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1045"> foreign flags is nonsense. The Australian ships would flag out immediately in order to gain the tax advantages of their competitors and we would finish up with no Australian fleet at all. Is this what the government is proposing? It is proposing that we in Australia exchange safe, well maintained, well crewed ships for the foreign ships. Additionally, it would put several thousand seafarers onto the dole and significantly increase our balance of payments problem through the profits and wages repatriated out of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lest I be accused of racism by some, let me make it clear that I am not opposed to foreign crews per se. I am opposed, however, to the use of foreign crews to circumvent the proper pay and working conditions enjoyed by Australian seafarers. If foreign crews are to be used, we must ensure that they are paid according to established Australian standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been very concerned about the increase in the issue of single voyage permits. I am opposed to the issue of these permits because it is a way to weaken cabotage in this country. In most of the world cabotage is closely protected, but the issue of single voyage permits is a way around this. The use of single voyage permits as a means to carry freight around the nation is gaining momentum, increasing the use of foreign flag vessels as a transport option for Australian business. This increased use will also have an effect on rail operators endeavouring to maintain a competitive edge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Single voyage permits are supposed to be issued when there is no Australian ship able to do the work. It is in this case that a permit may be issued. Before the Department of Transport and Regional Development issues the permit it is supposed to contact the unions and satisfy itself that these ships meet all Australians standards. The issue of these permits, in their ever&hyphen;increasing numbers, is nothing short of a farce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that these ships in the main do not comply with Australian standards. Too many of these ships are not being inspected and too many are not meeting Australian standards. The dramatic increase in the number of single voyage permits being issued over the last few years is not a matter <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for celebration. The rules in existence should be enforced according to this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of us who take an interest in shipping could give many examples of the condition of ships issued with single voyage permits. I have seen many of these ships but the one that is indelibly etched on my mind is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A.P.J. Anano</EMPHASIS>, which was issued a single voyage permit from Albany in Western Australia to Gladstone in Queensland. It was then going to go on to Mackay to pick up sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This ship, which was supposed to meet all of the requirements, had some 140 defects. The two mates on the ship were only cadets and did not have proper certificates. I know this because, at the invitation of the union, I inspected this detained ship. This is the sort of rust bucket that those opposite will put on the Australian coastline with all its tragic threats to our environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the new members in their first speeches made mention of the sell&hyphen;off of Australian assets overseas. If they are so concerned, why are they supporting this legislation? Do they want to be selective about what should be sold? I remember the debate last year on the sale of Dreamworld. While I accept that Speedo, Arnotts biscuits and Vegemite fit the category of Australian icons, I find it difficult to accept that an American&hyphen;style theme park can quickly obtain Australian icon status. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to recall some history in relation to shipping. I do have some personal experience, unlike some members on the other side who have the theory but not the practice. I was a marine engineer. I sailed on the Australian coast and I sailed on foreign ships. I also worked with Evans Deakin, which was a large <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1046"> shipbuilding firm in Brisbane. As a result of the hopeless industrial practices that obtained in the late 1960s and early 1970s, that shipyard is now defunct&mdash;but that is another story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been on foreign ships and I have seen the way these foreign ships are maintained. I am not talking about the ships that have been mentioned by some members opposite&mdash;the rust buckets are another story. I have been on Australian ships, and I am talking about an Australian rust bucket. I worked on a foreign vessel which was some 20 years old. I then came to join an Australian ship and when I saw the state of the ship I said to someone, `Gee, this is an old one to be on the coast.' They said, `Old! It's only three years old.' I said, `You're joking!' Then I looked on deck and there was rust everywhere, the place was not painted and there did not seem to be any activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Engineers at sea work four hours on and eight hours off, and they carry out maintenance if it has to be done. When I was on these ships on the Australian coast going from Gladstone to Weipa, I never once saw a seaman on deck working. I said to a few people, `What's going on here? There is rust everywhere and there is painting that needs to be done. Don't they work?' I was told that they only do their shift, they only do the steering, that they do not work when they are at sea, that they are not paid to work; they are paid to sit in the crew's mess. I think they were getting $40,000 to $50,000 a year to do that. At that stage they were getting three-quarters of a day off for every day that they worked. I can tell you that generated a lot of bitterness on the part of the engineers and the mates. They saw great inequities. They saw the standard of shipping going down because these people would not work and could not be made to work.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really are looking at a question of myth and reality. The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said that the world would collapse if we did not have these subsidies. I really do not have much sympathy when I hear BHP crying about subsidies. The fact of the matter is that BHP and a lot of the Australian shipowners would not stand up to the Seamen's Union of Australia. That is the problem. Nobody was game to stand up to the Seamen's Union. As I said before, it always generated antagonism between the engineer officers, the mates and the seamen because the seamen always got what they wanted. I have seen seamen refuse to sail because a toilet seat was not painted the right colour. That is what members on the other side do not understand. A ship was held up in Hobart for two days because they refused to sail. Nothing could be done about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot have an industry that is propped up with taxpayers' subsidies when the union oligarchy are not being held accountable. They were not held accountable; the shipowners were not game to take them on. Obviously, with the arrangement that was entered into by the former minister, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), the government was never game to take them on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, that has led to the parlous state of the ship industry in Australia. It gives me no pleasure to say that because I would like to see a viable shipping industry around this country. You can lay the blame for the state of this industry at the feet of shipowners who were not prepared to stand up to the unions and unions being bloody-minded about the whole position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1047"> The ANL fiasco was just one example. I do not need to go into the deals that were en tered into to prop ANL up when the MUA decided that they would not, under any circumstances, agree to the sale of ANL to P&amp;O. The member for Kingsford-Smith appointed a committee of management. I need not go into it, but a lot of money was spent on fees and more and more money was thrown away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to look at the issue of employment. People say, `What about the employment of seamen and seafarers and men and women in that industry?' I can tell you: it was a closed shop then; it is a closed shop now. Try to get a job on a ship if you do not have a union ticket. I was happy to be a member of the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers. I wanted to be a member. That was okay by me, but there were a number of people who did not want to be. If they did not want to be&mdash;if they had any conscientious objection&mdash;no&hyphen;one was prepared to listen, they were out and they could not get a job. That applied even more so in the Seamen's Union and the cooks and stewards union. There was a closed shop mentality. Now you hear the people on the other side of the chamber crying about the fact that our shipping industry is really not going to go anywhere&mdash;in fact is going to go backwards&mdash;as a result of these proposals. In reality, they are just crocodile tears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite have never really addressed the fundamental problem; that is, the high cost of running these vessels&mdash;the high cost of labour. That is what it is, pure and simple. You cannot have a situation where seafarers are earning in some cases twice as much as&mdash;sometimes more&mdash;merchant seamen on ships from other countries, such as on British ships like the one I was on when I was working for the China Navigation Company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The member for Melbourne Ports and the member for Throsby looked at the lack of competitiveness then tried to brush it aside by saying, `It is not an easy question.' This is a way of pushing it to one side. What they really mean when they say, `It is not an easy question, there are problems here,' is that it is very hard to take on these people. They are hard heads; they will not listen to reason; they will not be told that you cannot run a ship ping industry when you are paying exorbitant rates to the seamen. The industry has got to be competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bloody&hyphen;mindedness has caused a loss of jobs, as I said before. No&hyphen;one more than me would like a viable shipping industry in this country. There are a lot of decent men and women out there who are wanting to go to sea but who cannot get to sea on the Australian coast because of this situation. It is not going to get any better. It is all very well to say, as the member for Throsby said, that we will have rust buckets around the country crewed by Third World people but staffed by Australian officers. I can tell you now that that is absurd. There is no way in the world that Australian officers would go around the Australian coast in rust buckets. They just would not do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I know my fellow seafarers from those days better than those in the opposition do; and those seamen would not allow members of the deck&mdash;cooks and stewards&mdash;to get lousy wages and conditions. By the same token, they would want to see a fair and equitable situation all around, where people had work and got a reasonable rate of pay for their work, and where shipping ran to time&mdash;picked up, dropped off and turned around according to the timetables that will have to obtain if the shipping industry is to be viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that the member for Melbourne Ports in his contribution became a little emotive in a misplaced fashion, if I can say so, in relation to loss of lives. Of course seamen lost lives during the war, but the member for Page (Mr Causley) was not talking about the situation of seamen during the war. He was talking about the waterside workers back on the home front who were not supporting the merchant seamen who went to war and risked their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no good throwing a massive lot of irrelevancies into this equation and saying that this shows a lack of understanding by the member for Page. It simply is not correct to say that. He was talking about what was happening on the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Maritime Union of Australia has not learned from what is happening. Things are slipping from their grasp, bit by bit. This <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1048"> great power thing they have had all these years&mdash;the power over hiring and firing, the power to run the industry the way they want and the power to kick the shipowners into line whenever they felt like it&mdash;is slipping from their grasp. But they are still into the collateral dispute phenomenon, as they always have been. That was shown during the Weipa dispute. They had to join it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that these people want to get into that sort of thing all the time? Why is the union leadership taking its members into that area? I do not think it is fair to say that it has entirely been the seamen who are driving this vessel, if I can put it that way; it is the union leadership that has always driven it. Frequently the deck crew, the able seamen, have had to go along with that&mdash;many times reluctantly. This applies even more in relation to the engineering officers and the mates. They were all separate until the union was amalgamated into one, some years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this bill is to get some sanity back into this situation. When I am listening to the contributions from the other side, they seem to be saying, `We just have to keep subsidising this industry ad infinitum without any sort of accountability to the Australian taxpayer because we have this great, viable industry and we want to prevent rust buckets from coming to this country. We want to make sure that we have some sort of Australian shipping industry.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has a logical end in itself. If you keep subsiding an industry to the extent that it is being subsidised, will it ever get out of the trough it is in? My argument is that it will not. There has to be a realisation that this situation cannot continue. That is what the bill is trying to do. It is addressing the very fact that taxpayers are going to be saved $52 million over the next four years. They will see that the government is determined to implement its election commitment to repeal the two acts that were promulgated by the previous minister. I totally support these bills.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just heard comments that confirm my suspicion that the government seems intent on a fairly major confrontation with the Maritime Union of Australia, a union <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which seems to be the bogy boy of the Australian work force&mdash;a label which is completely unjustified, particularly in light of the reforms that have taken place in the last 10 years. Clearly we are seeing the beginning of an ideologically blinkered view of shipping and the waterfront dominating government policy. The government seems to believe that the Australians&mdash;and, remember, that is what they are&mdash;who work in these industries on the waterfront and in shipping, including in my electorate of Fremantle, are somehow second&hyphen;class citizens and do not deserve the sort of protection that other Australians deserve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem that the government is also motivated by a desire to drive down costs. We have just heard that this would apparently save Australian taxpayers some $50 million over four years. But the costs of doing this are much greater. If you are going to look at a piece of legislation, you have to look at costs and benefits. Yes, there may be some short-term savings, but there will be some very long-term costs to the Australian economy, to the environment and to the Australian work force. The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill is very short-sighted legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motivation to drive down costs no matter what the cost is to the workers and their families is to be condemned. The government does not seem to care about the costs to the environment or to the safety standards and conditions in international shipping. The ultimate goal seems to be the destruction of the Australian shipping industry and its replacement by vessels operating under flags of convenience and second register crews. Yes, it is cheaper, but it is at a much greater cost to the community overall. There may be short-term benefits to some exporters, but there will be long-term costs to the Australian community. That is very important to emphasise. This proposed legislation will undermine the viability of the Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1049"> If anyone thinks that Australia is unique in providing some level of support to the shipping industry, they should think again. In fact, Australia is unique in providing a relatively low level of support. By international stand ards, particularly in OECD countries, we do not provide much support. If you are going to look at that sort of subsidy argument, what about the level of subsidy provided to road transport, which is not environmentally friendly at all? That is something I am acutely aware of in my new position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The immediate effects of this legislation will be the early withdrawal of capital grants and grants paid to international trading vessels. As we have heard from a number of people&mdash;and this deserves to be stressed&mdash;that means there will be less incentive to invest in new ships and technology. That will result in an ageing fleet, and that means in the long term that increased costs will be passed on to consumers. So what is left of the fleet will be more expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation means that increases in capital productivity are less likely as the cost of new vessels increases. As we have heard, there are several vessels already under construction and this legislation means that there will be a direct, unplanned, retrospective increase in costs&mdash;an extraordinary outcome from members who have always complained against such outcomes in legislation. That leaves BHP and two other Australian shipping operators facing not just a few thousand dollars extra in increased costs but multimillions of dollars in costs right now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP have actually warned the government that the abolition of these measures will leave the industry in limbo&mdash;that is very strong language from a pre-eminent company&mdash;and will place Australia at a severe disadvantage in the international community. I am very interested in the reaction of BHP because in my state of Western Australia they are very major operators in the mining industry and are very important contributors to the national economy. So, if that is their view, it should be heeded by the government. As I have already indicated, other countries have very generous tax concessions to their shipping industries. Indeed, some are effectively registered tax havens: they are completely free of any taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to look at the long-term and general impacts of the legislation as well as the short-term impacts. There will be an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> overall deterioration in the industry. A negative effect on the services component of the current account has been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). BTCE estimated that for 1986-87 the current account deficit would have been increased by $440 million if there had been no merchant fleet. That is a very significant increase. We also heard&mdash;and, again, from a Western Australian point of view, this deserves to be underlined&mdash;that there will be substantial effects on our defence capacity. We understand there are MOUs between some shippers and the navy to provide assistance in national emergency, but they also provide routine transport assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the point of view of the shadow minister for the environment, sea transport is&mdash;at least with safe, properly built ships&mdash;environmentally much more desirable than some forms of land transport. For example, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, bulk sea transport generates 13 grams per tonne per kilometre compared with 29 grams for rail. So you would be moving to less desirable forms of transport if you got rid of our shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there are flow-on effects to support industries. I am particularly concerned about this in my own seat of Fremantle, which has an active and thriving port. The flow-on effects include reductions in marine insurance, in providoring, in towage and pilotage, in the development of shipping technology and in repair and maintenance. You can destroy ports in this country by destroying the shipping industry, and the flow-on effects would be very great indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to point to the effects on crews. Australian crews are highly trained. The use of poorer quality crew and older, less well&hyphen;maintained vessels will certainly be the outcome of this legislation. That means there will be an increase in insurance costs to users. In the short-term you might cut back on costs to the taxpayers, and even in some cases on costs to the users, but in the long term you will have less well&hyphen;trained crew, you will have increased risk of damage and you will have bigger insurance costs. We have seen some huge payouts recently where ships have failed.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1050">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a huge risk of environmental damage, and I am very concerned indeed about this. Look at the traffic along the Great Barrier Reef, one of the pearls not only of our environment but also of our tourism industry. What is being proposed in this legislation will see more of what are rightly described as rust buckets plying trade up and down our coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be the same impacts in Western Australia. There was a very near miss off the WA coast in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> incident. We are coming up to the anniversary of that very sad event. Following that incident was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> inquiry. The evidence it turned up is quite shameful for Australia and the international shipping community. In the case of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>, we saw the ship break up. It seemed to be held together with chewing gum and string. Ultimately it was barely seaworthy at all. In fact, events showed that it was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People put their lives at risk to prevent environmental damage in that case. We were fortunate that not much fuel was spilled. Had it been, it would have been not just the pristine coast of Western Australia that was damaged but an entire industry. That part of the world, that part of our coast, is a very important part of the fishing industry in Western Australia. The lobster industry around Geraldton would have been decimated not just for that season but for years to come. So when we undertake measures like this we put at risk a great deal more than those dollars of taxpayers' funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation and the approach of which it is part are blind to the fact that many countries provide very substantial financial assistance to their fleets&mdash;concessional tax rates, depreciation allowances, concessional loans and subsidies. The abolition of these for Australia will place us at a disadvantage in international competition. It is not about a level playing field; it is about the lowest common denominator. What lies behind this is a desire to push down costs to some Australian exporters against those international trends. It means the loss of jobs at every point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am the daughter of a farmer, so I know some of the disputes that have gone on over the years between the farming sector and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> waterfront unions. But I also know that farmers generally respect those unions when they are standing up for Australian wages and conditions. What we are being asked to do here is substitute a work force and ships that are of lower standard than we would accept for our own workers. You are basically saying that we should drive out the Australians and it does not matter if we employ Filipinos, Russians or Koreans on these ships that are falling apart. In international terms, that is an extraordinary attitude to adopt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If ships ply our ports, in my view they should operate at the same standard as we expect for all Australians. People do not cease to be Australians just because they work offshore or on the waterfront. They are as much Australian as everyone else. We would no more suggest to workers on farms that they should accept Third World wages and conditions than we would fly to the moon. So what is acceptable for the rest of us is acceptable for the Maritime Union and the people it represents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing about this legislation and again the associated pushes for so-called reform is that they ignore the significant gains that have been made by shipowners and workers over the last decade. It is not as if we have been standing still here. There have been very significant improvements&mdash;increases in both productivity and competitiveness. A lot of the workers whom I have talked to are getting thoroughly sick of that not being recognised. They have put in an enormous effort and people are still telling them they have done nothing. It might be sensible to say that more can be done, but we should at least recognise what has been done and the effort that has been put in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of these reforms, the Australian fleet is half the age of the world fleet. We have modern technology. Disputes are at an historic low. I take issue with people who say that the waterfront unions, now amalgamated, have not been party to reform and are not interested in reform. They are. The manning levels are consistent with civilised international standards&mdash;and I emphasise `civilised'. We should not be comparing ourselves with ships of convenience. We should not use that as the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1051"> standard. We should use as an example those countries of the OECD and the United States which do, at least in their coastal shipping, adhere to these decent standards. Yes, the manning levels are not as low as some of the ships of shame, but I do not think we should aspire to that. Demarcation disputes have been all but eliminated. There have been very significant reforms on the waterfront, and I think they deserve to be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put on record today my abhorrence at the moves by the present government in relation to cabotage and reducing, through these measures, the wages and conditions of Australian seafarers. That is what it is all about: reducing them to the lowest common denominator of the flags of convenience vessels and some Third World merchant marines. They are very low levels indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I became the member for Fremantle only recently&mdash;some two years ago&mdash;I have already seen examples that would curl your hair. These flags of convenience avoid all national regulations. They get away literally with murder. They are issued by small countries which do not care about what happens on the ships carrying their flag. They have no interest once the licence is issued. Ownership is usually structured through offshore financial mazes in order to escape completely any regulations and indeed any liability. It is very difficult to track them down and find out who is responsible and who should pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Competitive rates' are achieved by things like lower maintenance and poorer safety standards. Crews are protected by no civilised regulation at all. They are treated as raw labour and paid wages a fraction of those of developed countries such as Australia. When I say a fraction, I mean that&mdash;a tenth or a one&hyphen;hundredth in some cases. They can also be hired, fired and treated exactly as the captain wishes. I do not know whether members paid attention to this but just recently several men working obviously under very difficult circumstances on a ship jumped overboard and at least one was killed. Many of the crews are national units from Third World countries, countries like the Philippines or Russia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The practical effect of all this so-called competition has been the creation of small, floating slave gangs&mdash;that is precisely what they are&mdash;with no protection at all. Our shipping industry is being asked to compete with that. That is totally unreasonable. This measure and other foreshadowed measures place Australian workers at very considerable risk indeed. Having outlawed socially unacceptable standards on our own ships and on our waterfront, the government now seems to want to embark on a course which will sabotage our fleets by sending and receiving our goods by ships which adhere to 18th century standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth remembering that we have seen with a lot of the reforms that have taken place because the union movement has pushed for them the removal of laissez faire capitalism, where people could do what they liked with their workers and there was no regulation of pay and conditions. We have moved away from that. Unions have spent most of this century fighting sometimes reluctant employers to achieve improved standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now being asked under the guise of competition to go back to something we thought we had seen the back of. Yes, unions have fought hard&mdash;the maritime unions more than most&mdash;to secure those conditions. But those who have a little interest in history will know that it was only as recently as the Depression that workers lined up on the docks to scramble for a ticket that would give them a day's work. That is why they became tough operators. They still had the collective memory about what it was like when there was complete deregulation&mdash;no regulation at all, no decent standards, no security of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I for one would not want to see any sector of our community go back to those times, yet I think that is precisely what is happening at the moment&mdash;not just in this area but in a whole range of areas the current government is anticipating. I am sure I will have more to say about this when we see the IR legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whenever we look at the economy of a country, if we do not look at the costs&mdash;the social, environmental and other costs&mdash;we are kidding ourselves. Our nation's wealth is not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1052"> simply the dollars that flow in and out of the country. It is also the standard of living of all Australians, and that includes people who work on the waterfront and in shipping. As the member for Fremantle, I will stand up for those people, but not unreasonably or blindly, whenever they are attacked. When their conditions are attacked in that way, I will certainly be there for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not convinced by the morally bankrupt argument that, if we do not use cheap labour and these cheaper ships, other countries will and we will be at a competitive disadvantage. That formula has been used time and again over the centuries to justify everything from slave trade to child labour, polluting industries and selling arms to all comers. That is the argument we hear. It is morally bankrupt. It is the most banal and insidious of excuses for doing wrong. I repudiate it and in this case reject the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with my colleague the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), and other colleagues in opposing this shipping grants legislation. The Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister and others have put the general case more than adequately but eloquently. I will try to add to what they have had to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will comment on what this legislation says to Australians about this government's attitude to Australian industry in general and the shipping industry in particular, my area of responsibility&mdash;industrial relations&mdash;and the role of government in our society. I will talk about the consequences for our economy and our sense of nationhood. What is it that we have here? The combined effect of the efforts of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) will lead to uncertainty in an industry for which he is responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, it is not a unique achievement; he has done it in several other industries too. He is doing it with great effect to the aviation industry. But, here, with regard to these bills, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we have the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Shipowners Association saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a substantial pause in investment in the industry is likely to take place due to the increased level of uncertainty that now exists . . .</PARA>
<PARA>By what criterion can you suggest that that pause in investment is in our national interest? The comments go on to say that the industry has grown but this growth will now stall. That is some achievement: a stall in the growth of Australia's shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not repeat the figures that have been stated, firstly by the shadow minister, then by the Leader of the Opposition and others, about the proportion of our cargo, both domestically and internationally, which is carried in Australian ships. But it seems hard to imagine that a minister, in this instance, might set himself a goal of achieving uncertainty and stalling the growth of the industry. That is his first, and so far only, claim to fame with regard to this industry. It obviously has adverse consequences for the industry; you can see that directly in the comments about investment and in the comments that others have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to take up the time of the House merely and unnecessarily duplicating those remarks. However, I do want to talk to some extent about the implication for the broader economy, especially for our current account deficit. This is an issue I spent a great deal of time giving consideration to over the last two years when I had responsibility for trade policy in the previous government. One of the trends that was apparent&mdash;overall, a very positive trend&mdash;and one of the reasons that our current account deficit as a percentage of our gross domestic product was falling and why the report that we released in January suggested that the export trends were in place to shift us to a new growth plateau without blowing out the current account deficit, was the significant improvement in our balance of payments in the goods sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was particularly because of the increase in exports and manufactured goods and also the improving prospects, both in terms of price and output, of the resources sector. It suggested that in those areas of manufactured goods we were doing better and better. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1053"> other area in which improvement was noticed, but necessary to maintain, was the services sector. One of the significant areas of deficit in services is transport services because, for an island nation, we have such dependence upon international shipping services. That adds billions of dollars to our current account deficit. Of course as a trading nation we will continue to have our international cargoes carried by ships from many parts of the world, as our ships carry goods around the world also. We cannot, and should not, seek to close our ports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do have the circumstance where the proportion going into Australian vessels, with consequences for our current account deficit, is in jeopardy. It is in jeopardy not because our industry has failed to come to grips with international demands, not because companies have failed to invest, not because the partners&mdash;employers and employees&mdash;have failed to adjust to the demands of international competition, but as a result of a conscious decision of the government to withdraw those supports, which the industries with which they compete have in other countries, which enable them to compete on the so-called level playing field. This is another instance of the perverse consequence of a conscious decision of a government to put an important industry, which is a making a significant contribution to turning around our current account deficit, under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other broader implications which have been dealt with. They are important, and I want to refer to them but not dwell on them. There are, of course, the defence implications, which the Leader of the Opposition spoke about with the passion which defence issues usually bring to him, and the environment matters which my colleague the shadow minister for the environment, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), just referred to. They are significant with regard to this change. If this is part of the package which we expect it to be with issues of cabotage and second register, et cetera, becoming the next part of the package, those issues take on even greater significance. The environment issues become even more important the defence consequences even more profound. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is more, one should say&mdash;that is, the indication this gives about the role of government in our society as viewed by this so recent government and this so recent minister. The changes that have been taking place in the industry did not occur in isolation. They were part of an agreement&mdash;an industry development package announced in December 1986 which contained three points: union agreement to changes to improve efficiency; ship operators' agreement to invest; and government agreement to provide financial incentives to facilitate the process of reform. This was an important agreement with three parties making a commitment. From that period to this, the three parties have honoured their commitments. But what we find now is the government reneging on its part of the deal. This new government will hope to see the other two parties continue to maintain their side of the agreement but renege on its side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that with a change of government after an election both the consequence of uncertainty to which I referred initially and the reneging on agreements are a consequence of a change of policy and the initiatives taken by new governments to implement their new policy. So some period of adjustment is always necessary. It is unreasonable to expect that every new government will not want to change policy in at least some areas. But when we see that the consequences of change are uncertainty and stalling in important investment, when we see that the implication of the change is reneging on an agreement with its potential consequence for the capacity and willingness of the other two parties to sustain their part of this important reform package, we have to do some sort of cost-benefit analysis. We have to say: what is it that justifies the uncertainty, the reneging on the agreement and its consequences? </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where are the benefits which flow to compensate for these consequences? Where is the benefit that flows from creating an environment where Australian workers and Australian businesses are put at an international competitive disadvantage? Why would a government, as a matter of conscious policy, say, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1054"> `We want to put the Australian industry at a disadvantage compared with those with whom it must compete'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my two years as trade minister or in my public life I have never been an advocate of taxpayer subsidies to give Australia unfair advantages. We complain about others around the world doing that, about the United States using its taxpayers' money to subsidise its agricultural industry to give it an unfair advantage in comparison with us and about the Europeans doing the same. I do not advocate we should do that firstly because I think it is very bad policy and secondly for the self&hyphen;evident reason that there are many competitors with deeper pockets than us. So it is a competition which we could not win if we were prepared to give away good policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly have never advocated and have never seen a precedent for a government policy saying: we will deliberately set out to put the industry at a competitive disadvantage by withdrawing a grant, a package of support, which is available&mdash;not in the circumstance where this can in some way be justified by the great con that is being perpetuated about budget circumstance because it is a longstanding policy of the coalition that precedes by at least several years any evidence that they claim to have concerning the current budgetary situation. In any event, we are talking about $52 million over four years. We are talking about not even a small indentation, let alone a large black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we must ask why a government would do this, why for this minuscule saving when it does not make economic sense for the industry&mdash;a very important industry with all those flow-on, land based consequences that I heard the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) speaking of earlier and the member for Fremantle speaking more recently about, both on the basis of their experience and their commitment to their local constituents. It is certainly not a move reflecting international trends or our international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The international trends suggest that in the OECD countries, in the countries with which we normally compare ourselves, in the countries with which we are competing in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shipping area, these sorts of supports, modest as they are, that are undermined and under threat by this bill in fact are commonplace. At least a dozen OECD countries have similar provisions in place. Others have different sorts of support arrangements for their shipping industry because they know the international competitive environment in which they must compete. We are not confronting an international obligation that requires us to do something about which we feel uncomfortable morally or are under international law obliged to act. That is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not that the industry has failed to invest. It is not that industry has failed to meet its side of the bargain. The most recent figures I looked at suggest investments of about $2 billion since 1989 and, very significantly for this bill, substantial investment commitments made on the basis of government policy at the time the investment decision was made, the bottom line for which is going to be profoundly adversely affected by legislation which is in its impact retrospective. The fundamentals of law about changes to tax and changes to government policies as they affect citizens and corporations have always been that you should be able to make decisions confident in the fact that the law that applies when you make the decision will not he changed in a way that adversely affects the decision that you have made on the basis of a proper understanding of the current law. Of course, the law may change in future. If you enter into a 20-year commitment, you enter into it in the knowledge that in year five, 10, or 15 you might be in a different environment. Particularly in a democracy that is always possible, but not such that it goes to affect retrospectively the decision which you made on the understanding you had of the grants that would be available to affect your assessment of the bottom line of an investment decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several of our major corporations&mdash;BHP was cited, but it is not the only one&mdash;have made important investment decisions which will enhance the quality of our shipping fleet and now find the viability of those investments put at risk with broader consequences for the industries that they support, the so- <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1055">called triangular trade and its importance for the steel industry, for example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not that the industry has failed to invest. It is not that the unions and the employers have not been able to come to agreement about reform of the industry. I refer only briefly to the standard figure with regard to staffing that others have quoted&mdash;the 31.6 standard in 1986, falling to 18.4 per vessel in 1995. One thing we can be certain of is that it was not an industry change made at the request of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why have these changes been made? It does not meet any of the normal criteria by which you would suggest that, in an analysis, a government might choose to act. It seems to me clearly that this is part of a package to encourage and attempt to force the shipping industry to confront its employees and the Maritime Union of Australia&mdash;a conscious and deliberate attempt to promote, to encourage, to attempt to force confrontation between the employers in the shipping industry and on the waterfront and those employees and the unions which represent them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the first of a series of such measures, to be followed by cabotage, by the second register, by what might be proposed for the waterfront. We see in the background&mdash;slightly to his credit, I suppose, to some extent it was acknowledged by the minister for transport&mdash;that the big changes are waiting in the hope that when the industrial relations legislation, the so&hyphen;called workplace relations bill, comes in, it will, by its passage, provide a big stick, sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act, so that when this attempt to force confrontation has its impact, the employers and the government will be armed with weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it very frustrating as an Australian to see this circumstance in which, at the time in our history when we have the lowest level of strikes and a very low level of industrial disputation on the waterfront, we have a government setting out to raise the penalties for industrial disputes, to bring in new, enhanced penalties, to deal with disputes. Why do they think this problem will occur? It is not because there is a proliferation of strikes in Australia, because there is not. There has been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a record level of industrial peace for a decade. It is because they know their policies will provoke industrial disputes. In fact, it would be a terrible disappointment to them if they did not, because that is their clear and deliberate intent in the case of the waterfront&mdash;but not everywhere, I accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other disputes they will provoke will be by inadvertence and incompetence. But, in this case, you cannot claim those two things. This is a deliberate attempt to create that confrontation and to arm themselves and the employers with the weapons to seek to change the industrial balance of power in a way that can have only adverse consequences for the working conditions of the men and women in the maritime industries and those who support them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had 13 years of record industrial peace, by the end of which we were beginning to overcome the legacy of industrial strife with which previous conservative governments left us. Around Asia, we were slowly beginning to overcome the view that Australia was not a good place to do business with because it was plagued by strikes. After 13 years, we were just beginning to overcome that, and now we are consciously trying to go back to it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So for general transport and other policy reasons outlined by the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister and others, for broader socio&hyphen;economic reasons, particularly for industrial relations reasons, I join my colleagues in urging the House to reject this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996, which is before this House, is, I believe, simply a process to satisfy the government's black&hyphen;hearted hatred of the Maritime Union of Australia. During the election campaign the coalition's slogan was, I believe, `for all of us'&mdash;for all Australians. But not if you are a public servant, not if you are an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, not if you are an immigrant from a non&hyphen;English speaking background, not if you want a telephone in the future in regional Australia, and especially not if you happen to be a member of the Maritime Union of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1056">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not legislation to unify Australia. This is not legislation of composition, of joining together, of union, of blending of amalgam of the best or of any harmony whatsoever. This is not legislation of partnership in league with a crucial Australian industry. This is legislation of bloody&hyphen;minded malevolence, cussedness and bad intent. Put that together with the betrayal of the cloven hoof, spite, malice, acrimony, truculence, churlishness and maliciousness and you have the classic recipe for disorder, confrontation and disharmony which this government seems to be intent upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would think that a new government would at least want to acknowledge the warm and cuddly rhetoric it espoused during the election campaign. But no; it is simply driven by an ideological frenzy to destroy a crucial Australian industry which cannot be argued is in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation brings forward the expiry date, from 30 June 1997 to 30 June 1996, of grants provided under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. This is, of course, an act which was not opposed by the coalition in 1987 and in fact was the culmination of a process initiated by a coalition transport minister, Ralph Hunt, through the Crawford report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This ships act 1987 provides a taxable grant of seven per cent of the capital value of new or used ships registered in Australia that are owned by Australian taxpayers and subject to certain crewing requirements. The termination is expected to secure some $12 million in 1996&hyphen;97. In other words, it is pretty clearly anti&hyphen;Australian ownership and it is very clearly anti&hyphen;Australian investment in a crucial industry in which any trading nation must take a long&hyphen;term view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other content of the bill repeals the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995 which provided a taxable grant to the ship operator&mdash;not the Maritime Union of Australia&mdash;equal to PAYE tax payments at award rates for vessels which undertake more than 50 per cent of their voyage time on overseas routes. Repealing this grant is expected to save $40 million over the four years to 30 June 2000. As with the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> former act, it is not clear if this includes any company tax which would have been paid on the grant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures put forward by the government will seriously undermine the viability of the Australian shipping industry. As I will quite clearly point out, they are certainly not in Australia's national interest or in the interest of Australians. We on this side of the House, of course, remember coalition governments of the past: that they would embark on the lower side of national interest comes as no surprise to us. Why would a government decimate the national merchant fleet in the national interest?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does anyone on that side of the House understand that the defence capability of our nation will be severely compromised by the vengeance driven legislation of the government? Does anyone on that side of the House understand the memorandum of understanding that shipowners have with the navy to provide assistance in the case of a national emergency? Does anyone on the government side understand that some of our merchant fleet ships have facilities to specifically assist the navy? Does anyone on the government side understand that a lack of trained seafarers in Australia will also make emergency crewing of the navy difficult?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have members of the government forgotten that, in this country's defence, an integral part of the infrastructure would be the merchant navy? Have members of the government suffered a delusion of grandeur because they now occupy the treasury bench and, in that heady atmosphere, have simply forgotten the lessons of their parents in war? This government has been entrusted with awesome responsibilities, and one of these responsibilities ought to be the national merchant fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been lauding its Telstra environmental package on one hand and creating the potential for environmental disaster on the other. Does anyone on that side of the House understand that sea transport is environmentally more desirable than other forms of transport? In terms of energy consumption, bulk shipping uses only 0.2 megajoules per tonne per kilometre as compared with double the amount for rail, which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1057"> uses 0.4, and seven times the amount for articulated vehicles, which use 1.4. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, bulk sea transport generates the lowest carbon dioxide per tonne per kilometre. This is what the coalition means by sustainable environmental development. The minister does nothing. It is an interesting definition from the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many new members on the government side. I suspect at least a third of them are in for very short&hyphen;lived political careers. I suggest that the few who have further aspirations speak up about the importance of a national merchant fleet for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do they realise that Australian shipowners and workers have made significant gains in productivity and competitiveness in the last decade? I suspect not. Do they realise that waterfront reform since 1989 has resulted in stevedoring employee numbers being cut by 57 per cent; productivity at container terminals being doubled; annual savings of over $300 million being achieved from the reduced work force; the number of unions being reduced; the introduction of a new multiskilled classification which has eliminated demarcation; and grain and coal handling achieving world best standards? I suspect not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do they realise that, since 1990 and 1991, coal loaded through the port of Newcastle&mdash;one of the biggest coal loading operations in the world&mdash;increased by more than 30 per cent, representing an extra 11 million tonnes of coal? I suspect not. Do they realise that, between 1989 and 1995, the average loading time for grain ships decreased from 5.6 days to 1.4 days? I suspect not. Do they realise that, since 1989, over $2 billion has been committed to the investment of ships in Australia? What happens to BHP? What happens to the Mackay cooperative? What happens to the other investors? Not interested!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do they realise that the Australian fleet is half the age of the world fleet? Obviously not. Do those on the government side realise that manning levels in Australian international ships have fallen from an average of 31.6 in 1986 to 18.4 in 1995? Obviously not. At least in his second reading speech the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Sharp) conceded that these Australian manning levels are now consistent with international standards. Is he the only one? Is that the only thing he will acknowledge?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does anyone on the government side appreciate that industrial disputes in this industry hit their lowest levels in a decade in 1992&hyphen;93 when only 23 ship days were lost due to crew disputes? Obviously not. Is it right, is it proper, is it responsible or, indeed, is it prudent to attack an industry that has made such progress halfway through a restructuring process merely to satisfy the government's black&hyphen;hearted hatred and its ideological frenzy to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not heard anyone on the government side acknowledge that the decimation of shipping will have a negative effect on the net service component of the current account. For example, if there had been no merchant fleet from 1986 to 1987, the current account deficit would have increased by $440 million. That is about 14 per cent of the services deficit and about four per cent of the current account deficit. Pretty strange strategy, I would have thought, on the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who is at the table, should understand that knowledge is the lowest intellectual skill, but it is the one on which the coalition falters and fails, especially when it comes to Australian shipping. There is not much point in having higher intellectual skills, is there? Do not have anything like analysis or synthesis or insight or prediction or comprehension. Do not have any of those higher skills, just stick to the low level of knowledge. On this issue the coalition fails miserably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does anyone on that side of the House appreciate that Australian crews on Australian ships are some of the most highly trained in the world? Is there any appreciation over there that the use of poorer quality crew exploited from Third World countries and the use of older, less well&hyphen;maintained vessels&mdash;which have the habit of having accidents and regularly going to the bottom of the sea&mdash;will significantly increase insurance costs paid by the users? I guess not&mdash;not important. Is there <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1058"> any appreciation that Australian vessels undertake longer voyages than the average, often in very severe conditions? I guess not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is there any appreciation of the potential risk to our environment and the greater likelihood of environmental damage from shipping disasters on our shores? I guess not. These disasters could affect the fish nurseries, the Great Barrier Reef and ecotourism&mdash;the list goes on and on. What has the government actually considered in this legislation, other than its hatred of the Maritime Union of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is considerable damage to this nation implicit in this legislation. What about marine insurance? No answer. What about the provision of stores to ships? No answer. What about towage? No answer. What about pilotage? No answer. What about the development and supply of shipping technology? No answer. What about repairs and maintenance? No answer. What about jobs and investment in those areas? What about the cities and the people who live there? What about the future of this nation? Is the coalition going to make the export of jobs and investment a growth industry under its stewardship and have it follow the proposed Telstra debacle?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the reality eventually dawns on the Australian electorate&mdash;and make no mistake it will, although it will take some time&mdash;they will react accordingly. I made a prediction back in 1990 that this government would eventually get onto the treasury bench and that it would be there for one term. You will not see the year 2000. You do not deserve it and you have started to get yourself back over here where we are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This coalition will very quickly&mdash;and much quicker than you think&mdash;take its rightful place on the opposition benches, and it will do it much more quickly than some of those commentators up there think. Let us face it, port and other maritime regulatory authorities will have a greatly reduced pool of skilled labour to draw on. Not only may this affect the provision of harbourmasters and ship control officers but also safety, investigation and emergency personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one ought to be surprised that most countries, be they in the OECD or otherwise, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provide fiscal assistance to their national fleets. They use their brains, they use their nous. They do this for the reasons I have outlined. It is sensible, it is responsible and it is prudent for any nation to secure its merchant fleet. Why not Australia, shadow minister, why not Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that this country under the leadership of the coalition&mdash;I am trying to promote you&mdash;can ignore what no other responsible country would do? What do these responsible countries do? These countries provide depreciation allowances. These countries provide concessional tax rates. These countries provide concessional loans and they provide subsidies. They know through their own bitter experience that you do not under any circumstances decimate your merchant fleet, and those who ignore history do so at their peril.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Abolishing the assistance as proposed by this legislation will not create a competitive level playing field for Australian shipping in the international market but what it will do is place the Australian shipping industry in a great big black hole. This early withdrawal of the capital grant will have a number of specific effects on the Australian shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What incentives will there be for shipowners to invest in new ships and technology? We have one company in my electorate of Port Adelaide, South Australian Ships, building fast, aluminium, catamaran ferries. Is there any appreciation on the government's side that unless we invest in new shipping technology and jump ahead of the pack the Australian fleet will age and that this will have the guaranteed result of increasing costs which ultimately will be passed on to consumers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did you say before the election to these people who were investing in ships? Did you say anything about all of this? Did you tell them in your negotiations? No. Even when they were asked over there in the other place they had no indication whatsoever that this was going to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the costs of new vessels increase, as they surely will, then further increases in capital productivity and hence manning levels simply cannot occur. There are at least three vessels, as has been pointed out, currently under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1059"> construction that were to be delivered in the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year. This will see a direct, unplanned increase in the cost of these vessels which cost tens of millions of dollars to build over the space of a number of years. This is in direct contradiction to the minister's comments in his second reading speech about the need to provide transitional arrangements for the withdrawal of the accelerated appreciation allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Repealing the grant paid to international trading vessels will have some unintentional consequences. Australian vessels will switch their operations from international to coastal services, and this will increase the cost of international trade relative to coastal trade. Australian shipowners will therefore be placed at a competitive disadvantage in relation to ships registered in other countries where there are generous tax concessions and ships registered in tax havens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislation&mdash;or anything else&mdash;that is based on ideological frenzy, hatred, vengeance, black&hyphen;heartedness, scapegoating or whatever, is folly of the penultimate kind. This legislation ought to be vigorously opposed by anyone in this House who has Australia's long-term national interests at heart. If it is not, then, after the Telstra debacle, this shipping legislation folly, the proposed public sector slashing and the expected cuts in health, education and welfare, the government will add coffin nail after coffin nail to its electoral fortune. Many on the other side will watch their political careers go quickly into disappearance mode.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will not get away for much longer with the slippery rhetoric of justifying its actions by blaming the former government when the truth is that this government simply put itself into a corner by irresponsible election promises. Make no mistake, the truth will prevail. The truth always prevails. Unfortunately, it takes far too long at times, but it is inevitable. It is as certain as night follows day. If members of this House are concerned with this nation's long&hyphen;term national interest, they will have the courage and the integrity to vigorously oppose this foolhardy legislation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by mentioning part of a pamphlet prepared by the Maritime Union of Australia. It sums up how this nation ought to feel about a very crucial industry. It says that Australia has been a seafaring nation for over 200 years and that Australians are pretty proud of our maritime industry, which has a long history, a long tradition, and a lot of culture, and which has brought economic independence with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plea from the Maritime Union is not to let a political agenda of hatred ruin a viable Australian industry. This House ought to support its shipping industry. It ought to support its country. It ought to have a long&hyphen;term view of Australia as a trading nation. This bill will bring disharmony, confrontation and a deal of angst that this coalition government will not have the ability to deal with. Mark my words, you are setting yourself down a path from which you will find it very difficult to return, and it will be to your great cost and to this nation's great cost.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill raises more than just the question of the merits of the shipping industry; it raises some very fundamental principles regarding appropriate government. The fact of the matter is that neither a government, a company nor an individual can legitimately purport to retrospectively take away rights, commitments or contractual obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of any transmission of business, the new corporate entity is obliged to comply with contractual obligations entered into by the previous entity. Why? Because others have relied on those undertakings or contractual obligations, in many cases acted upon them, and in many other cases acted to their detriment. In this case, our shipping industry has contributed some billions&mdash;not millions, but billions&mdash;of dollars to developing our shipping industry on the faith of commitments made by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This present government arrogantly, immorally and improperly is moving to take away those rights which have been acted on. If ever there was a demonstration of the need for a bill of rights, the actions of this government show precisely that. It is bad government, it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1060"> is immoral government, and it will pay the price for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the merits of this legislation, one must remember that, just as a computer feeds out rubbish if you feed in misinformation, this government is producing rubbish because it is acting on the basis of its own propaganda. It is acting on the basis of its blind prejudices and its illogical biases, and it is not prepared to govern according to reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that Australians hate and view with contempt is fanatics, and this government is demonstrating complete Thatcherite fanaticism and an incapacity to look at the real world. It is heading for disaster. The sooner the backbenchers&mdash;and I believe that many are competent; many are indeed small `l' liberals&mdash;start to realise the direction that they are heading in, the sooner they will stop their leaders taking them over a cliff, like Thatcherite lemmings heading to their destruction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is based on a false premise that the Shipping (Capital Grants) Act and the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Act are the result of a clandestine deal between the former government and the Maritime Union of Australia. The present government is wrong in that assumption because I personally am aware that, in addition to the MUA and shipowners, who obviously had a substantial input, there was significant impetus for the legislation from the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers, which has been in existence since 1905 and covers some highly skilled and extremely competent workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This contempt and blind passion in pursuing the MUA are entirely misplaced. While one would not normally have regard to which unions are involved, this government seems to proceed on the basis of analysing who the parties to a transaction are, whether they fit on the goodie or baddie side of the government's ledger, and then acting accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that there has been significant reform of Australia's shipping industry. A number of speakers have covered this issue but I wish to point out some of the more significant facts. The average crew level on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian ships is now about 18 and, out of 19 countries examined by the Bureau of Industry Economics, Australia has therefore improved its rating from sixteenth in the world in 1986 to second in 1994. Australian crewing levels are now lower than the world average crew size of 23.8 and the average OECD level of 22.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking about crewing on little cabin cruisers here; we are talking about massive structures, isolated in the oceans, confronting hurricanes and traumas of all kinds, being manned in many instances by 18 courageous Australians. And they are getting mud tipped on them by the fanaticism of this current government. In addition, there has been voluntary retirement of over 1,000 seafarers and retraining of 1,500 others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1988, with the introduction of 36 additional replacement vessels into the Australian fleet, representing a turnover of 45 per cent of the fleet, we are now looking at an average fleet age of 9.2 years compared to a world average of 17 years. In the last 10 years, 90 per cent of those ships which have tragically gone to the bottom of the ocean, resulting in loss of life and property and, indeed, causing significant environmental damage, have been 15 years old or more. Our ships are now half the age of the world average, and our shipping industry would, with support, prove and obtain the benefits of that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put reform in its context, between 1989 and 1996, despite inflationary trends, BHP's ship crew costs have been reduced from $2.78 million to $1.85 million&mdash;and that is an example using just one company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the need for the Ships (Capital Grants) Act in 1987, it is worth referring to the comment of the Taylor report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current fiscal incentives permit Australian ship owners capital costs to be competitive with those enjoyed by international operators. Capital costs are by far the largest percentage of annualised time charter costs faced by Australian dry bulk carriers. The measures have been extremely successful in promoting the modernisation of the Australian fleet. There is a need for certainty that they will be retained. The capital grants legislation expires in 1997 and will have the effect of removing access to the lessened depreciation period. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1061"> </PARA>
<PARA>This government is cutting right across that. They are taking a year off the commitment that the industry has given to itself until 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to the government's wishes, the International Shipping (Australian Resident Seafarers) Act did not result from a clandestine deal. It was in fact the Taylor report, the report of the chairman of the Shipping Industry Reform Authority, to the government in 1994 which first recommended the removal of payroll tax burdens on the shipping industry because of the fact that the tax was not a burden on other competing companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that Australian seafarers in the international trades spend some six months away from home port, yet the shipping companies are obliged to continue to pay to state governments, because of our federal system, the payroll tax commitments. Those commitments are not replicated by other countries and the purpose of the legislation was simply to even up the playing field so that our industry could compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those recommendations for that to occur came, as I said, in 1994 from the Taylor report. They did not come, as the government has claimed, from a clandestine deal done between the government and the MUA in respect of the restructuring of the ANL line. The analysis predated that and indeed the recommendations predated that. So, again, the government is acting on an entirely false premise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one wants to compare a success story and a disaster story, one simply has to look to the Canadian experience and the British experience. Canada in recent years has introduced a special exemption from corporate tax for income derived from international shipping operations. It is a conscious attempt on the part of the Canadian government to encourage the expansion of the Canadian international shipping service. It has been vitally important and indeed supremely successful in not only retaining shipping companies but attracting foreign shipping companies to Canadian shores. There has been a significant increase in employment and a significant increase in revenue raised for all Canadians from the progressiveness, the foresight, the courage and the rationality of the Canadian government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, we see the consequences of blind Thatcherite prejudices. In 1984, England&mdash;and it has been mentioned&mdash;was one of the major shipping countries in the world. As a result of the removal of the special capital allowances by the Thatcher government in 1984, it is now significantly falling behind its regional competitors, Sweden, Belgium, France and Germany. It resulted in a decision by Shell Tankers to transfer its crewing operations to Singapore and P&amp;O Containers to flag out five of its ships in order to reduce their respective crew costs. Indeed, P&amp;O has put five of its vessels under the Bermudan flag and reduced its tonnage on the United Kingdom register so that it is now 0.5 per cent of total tonnage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry leaders have pointed out that United Kingdom shipping has to compete with foreign fleets whose governments offer strong incentives for the employment of their nationals. What has happened is that it has not been able to compete. The shipping companies have been forced to go offshore, they have been forced to operate under flags of convenience, they have been forced to man their ships with foreign labour. That is what will inevitably happen if this government heads down the path which it is on course for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government makes token gestures towards nationalism by a proposal, for instance, to attempt to entrench our national flag in legislation. What about some realistic nationalism? Our products, as a result of this action, will not be carried by our ships proudly displaying our national flag. They will be carried by rust buckets displaying disgraceful flags of convenience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfortunate reality is that at some time, perhaps within the next 20 years or the next 50 years, there may well be a situation where Australia is involved in further international conflict. It has occurred and, indeed, the unfortunate reality is that it will probably recur. A number of speakers have addressed the significance of the maritime industry to our defence. Again the government is throwing away that resource; again it is showing the hypocrisy of its false boasts of encouraging Australian nationalism.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1062">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lack of trained seafarers is obviously going to be a future problem. The shipping companies, even if they themselves do not go offshore, but because they will need to make their contracts of employment in another country, will be engaging foreign labour. We will lose the benefit of some $4 million a year of training which our industry puts into its labour force and which flows those skills on to our industry generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, particularly in the light of the November report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>, the government is prepared to tolerate a situation where safety is significantly compromised, it should be prepared&mdash;indeed, the minister also should be prepared&mdash;to provide a personal indemnity to those involved in our tourist industry who will suffer when, inevitably, one of these ships of shame goes down off our coastline and destroys that section of our coastal environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that were to occur in our Barrier Reef area, no amount of money could address the loss. That is precisely what is on the cards. That report on the ships of shame showed that one flag of convenience vessel traversed our coastline through the Great Barrier Reef unescorted and unpiloted. Luck&mdash;and it was only luck&mdash;prevented an environmental disaster on that occasion. Yet the government is forcing our industry into a situation where it will have no alternative but to operate through such flag of convenience vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the environment, the shipping industry has made a tremendous input, improving its energy efficiency by 54 per cent in recent years compared to an improvement of only about nine per cent in the road transport industry. Generally, it decreases the problems of the road congestion, noise congestion and general road traffic our travelling public has to tolerate should they want to go away on their holidays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of speakers have already spoken of the significance of the Australian shipping industry to our balance of payments. The government, because it predicts, I think one speaker said, a saving to the government of $54 million in total over the next four years, wants to risk about $4 billion a year in foreign revenue earned by our industry. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mathematics simply do not add up. The government is torpedoing this industry in a reprehensible and retrospective fashion when shipowners, as I have mentioned, have already committed not millions but billions of dollars to restructuring this industry and updating their fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the government's reasons for this legislation. One speaker got up and said that we do not understand how bad the MUA is. He purported to relate some factual circumstance where some individuals objected to a ship sailing because of a different coloured toilet seat. That is what it boils down to. This government is destroying our shipping industry because it believes people have stopped ships sailing because of different coloured toilet seats. There is nothing more logical in the government's decision making processes than that blind prejudice. It is a disgraceful act and it is one based on blind prejudice. It was 150 years ago that a union advocated the introduction of the Plimsoll line. One wonders whether this government would also have been opposed to it because employees were going to receive some benefit through not drowning at sea. It is an outrageous act by any government, but more so when this government puts the legislation on its agenda so early upon obtaining government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996, because it is a genre of legislation which I suspect we will see more of in this term of government. It demonstrates that, as a government, they just have no idea of the role that government needs to play in terms of effective industry development of key sectors of our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, in effect, a strategy that will scuttle the shipping industry in this country, and it will scuttle it just as it has emerged into a modern, competitive and world&hyphen;class fleet. But emergence into that modern, competitive, world&hyphen;class fleet was only achieved because the government of the day, the former Labor government, was prepared to develop the consensus approach to getting the needed reforms in the industry and to steering that reform. It did not, as some on the other side <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1063"> would suggest, see us providing misguided incentives to the shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst incentives were paid, which this legislation now seeks to knock off, they were incentives entirely directed to correcting distortions that existed in the nature of the international shipping industry. The fact is that a competitive marketplace does not exist in international shipping and, to the extent to which we do not have a level playing field, not only is the role of government important in setting the framework, in getting the parties together, in developing the networks, but also it is absolutely essential that, to the extent possible, it can use the policy arms, whether it be through taxation or other forms, to address the distortions, to correct that which the market is clearly not in itself capable of doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the Labor approach, but what is this government's approach? It is an approach built on two fundamental thrusts, one of which is to cause industrial mayhem by taking on a significant union in this country&mdash;not a union that has shown an unwillingness to cooperate, to embrace change, to support international competitiveness. The other thrust is built around ideology, a view that a union such as this should not have as much influence and that it would be better if it had no influence. Rather than a consensus approach, the confrontation approach is adopted in two major forms&mdash;not in legislation that is before us at the moment but there are comments clearly flagging it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of the confrontational approaches is in the IR legislation which has been referred to and will be introduced in this House, I suspect tomorrow, with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) making great play of signalling out the MUA, the Maritime Union of Australia. If it is not enough to gut the safety nets, the fundamental protections of the trade unions and their members, we also see the second barrel effect, the ideological commitment to get rid of cabotage&mdash;against all the international trends. The government would dismantle another one of those mechanisms that is simply a response to what the major players are doing and the correction of a distortion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial mayhem is one side of the government's  approach. The other, which this legislation goes specifically to, is to effectively cut out the industry support, the sort of support and assistance that is necessary to deal with these distortions to try to level up the playing field so that no matter what you do in terms of internal reform you are not still behind the eight ball because of the way the international shipping industry is structured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two items&mdash;one of which is being repealed and the other is called an amendment but by changing the date it is effectively the same as a repeal&mdash;are essentially saying, `We won't give you that support any more. We will ignore the fact that the rest of the world is doing things differently and making it impossible for Australian flag shipping to compete. We're going to strip away the very basis of support for that industry'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this legislation is about. We oppose it in its specifics but we also oppose it in the broader context in which it is cast: the failed model of conflict, which is the ideological bent of the coalition parties, despite all of the progress that has been made under Labor and the consensus approach. Such a model maintains the stupidity of believing that, simply by asserting that the free market will function, a shipping industry can flourish. It will not and, under these measures, not only will we have industrial mayhem in the industry but we will also see the effective scuttling of what has been a hugely successful growth in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Andrew Thomson), who is at the table, is aware of the fact that, since the reforms that Labor has introduced into the shipping industry, we have seen $2 billion of investment into Australian flag vessels. That investment would not have occurred were it not for the reform strategy introduced and steered by the Labor government with the cooperation of all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just go to what this legislation specifically does. In the first instance it repeals the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Act from 1 July. This was an act introduced by the former government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1064"> in response to a finding from a review set up into the shipping industry, a review which was asked to find out why it was that Australian shipping was uncompetitive in terms of international marketplaces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that review found&mdash;and this was the Rae Taylor report&mdash;was that as a result of the changed overseas situation the competitive gap between Australian ships and comparable overseas ships was about $2 million per ship per year. The main reason for that gap was that most of the shipping against which we had to compete did not pay taxes. The employees did not pay taxes when they were on the blue water. What this legislation that Labor introduced did was to provide a grant to the shipping companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that our then opponents tried to say that this was a perk for seamen, that what we were doing was cutting their tax. The advantage did not go to the seamen, the advantage went to the shipping companies. It went by way of a grant to make them competitive with those with which they had to compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what you are doing is not getting at the employees&mdash;which I think some of you think you are, saying they were a protected species and why should they get what the rest of the work force does not get&mdash;you are getting at the companies. You are getting at them in one of the most stupid ways possible. After having investigated the reasons why it was difficult for them to compete and after recommending a solution where the benefit went directly to the companies to enable them to compete, you are now going to knock it off. I do not think that there could be a more stupid decision than this, especially coming so early in the life of this government. This will see the effective halting of any future investment in this industry, as will the decision, which is the next part of this composite piece of legislation, to bring forward the sunset provision applying to ships, the capital grants act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under that act there was a taxable grant of seven per cent of the purchase price provided to the purchaser of an Australian trading ship, an Australian flag vessel, subject to it complying with specified crewing requirements. In other words, it was leverage to ensure that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the vessel built was crewed in accordance with internationally competitive crewing levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard the argument that we are over-crewed, that Australia is uncompetitive. This was the very mechanism by which we made the new vessel competitive. This was saying, `You don't get the tax break unless you come to an arrangement that crews it in accordance with Australian standards.' Not only was it driving competitiveness, it was ensuring investment in the Australian shipping industry. These two pieces of legislation were vital components in a number of things that the Labor government put together to encourage the expansion of the Australian flag shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our approach was built around three interlocking components. One was the provision of an institutional structure through which change could be negotiated, and that reform goes way back to the early 1980s. The then Minister for Transport, the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), was actively involved in that. Labor has had a very large number of extremely effective transport ministers. The reform process went back to the implications of the Crawford report and culminated in 1989 in the Shipping Industry Reform Authority chaired by the person who is now the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, Ivan Deveson. I might add that I was privileged to be a member of that committee. In my previous role in the trade union movement I was part of the Shipping Industry Reform Authority. That became the vehicle by which we have seen, with the recommendations from all of those reviews and the strategy put in place post&hyphen;1989, this huge expansion in Australian shipping. We have seen $2 billion of investment in Australian vessels that would not have occurred, jobs that would not have been created, and services that would formerly have had to come from imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that Shipping Industry Reform Authority came down with was a commitment to micro&hyphen;economic reform by getting an assurance from industry that, if we reviewed the crewing levels, if we got the crewing levels down, if we introduced multiskilling, industry, in turn, would invest. There is no point in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1065"> doing these things unless what you can build is job security for the work force in question. We essentially developed an arrangement that said to the work force, `In return for the structural change and in return for you adopting new practices and new efficiencies, we will guarantee your industry.' It will be done through a combination of things that involve extra investment into the industry, a commitment by the private sector, the shipowners, and a commitment by the government of the day to develop this framework for consensus agreement on the reforms. There were also some important incentives, as I have said, aimed at correcting the international distortions in the shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing we did as part of this package was to contribute to the adjustment costs of the industry. Clearly, if you are going to downsize the crews that run the vessels, there are going to be people who can no longer be accommodated within the industry. Redundancy packages were necessary as were significant retraining costs. You cannot expect a work force that did single duties to become suddenly multiskilled unless you are prepared to invest in their training. That was part of the arrangement that the government was prepared to participate in together with industry support. Part of the arrangement was the fiscal support, the direct injections which are now going to be abolished by this new government. This government talks about the need to encourage success and growth in industry. But when it has got a $2 billion expansion in an industry that, effectively, was going out the back door&mdash;that was sinking&mdash;one of the first pieces of legislation it comes into the parliament with is something to sink that industry. That is not terribly smart, but I think it demonstrates that there is not proper understanding on that side of the House as to what is needed to get investment or industry in this country going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what the results have been from the reform package that Labor introduced and which is now going to be dismantled by the current government. What we saw were major reductions in crew complements. Before this package was put together the average crewing level on Australian vessels <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was around 35. We dropped that to 18&mdash;nearly halved it&mdash;by agreement with the unions concerned. Sure, there had to be these support packages put together but we got to that. The significance of 18 is that that is what the rest of the world does. We do not argue that we should not be internationally competitive. We simply say that if we are going to move to international competitiveness there should be assistance. We should not be kidding ourselves that those other countries are not helping their own industries. But what do we do now? This government comes in and says, `Thanks very much for all the pain so far as the work force is concerned, but we are going to cut away the commitments that were made by the previous government because we do not believe in them.' What you are trying to do is to unscramble the eggs. The reality is that you think that it is about taking on the unions when, in fact, you are going to scuttle the shipping industry in this country. We have seen, as a result of the package, not just the adjustments in crewing but a huge upgrading in the Australian fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen labour and capital productivity and fuel efficiency all significantly improve over the course of the last decade. Labor productivity is up 80 per cent; 1.4 million tonnes of cargo were handled per crew member in 1980&hyphen;81 with 2&half; million tonnes in 1993&hyphen;94. Yet those on that side of the House say that that has not happened and that there has been no improvement in the shipping industry in this country in all that time and that we still get held up on the wharves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do you think those figures demonstrate? They not only demonstrate huge productivity growth but they also demonstrate that you can achieve it if you are prepared to develop a sensible strategy. Capital costs associated with building the vessels are now the lowest, according to the Bureau of Industry Economics, when compared with the eight countries with whom we have to compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between 1986 and 1993 the average age of the Australian fleet has come down from almost 10&half; years to a little over nine years, with the world average being 16&half; years. This is a world&hyphen;class, modern fleet but it has only <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1066"> happened because of the strategy that Labor introduced. According to a 1992 study, the operating costs of Australian vessels are significantly below the OECD average. They may not be below the rust buckets, the ships of shame, but is that what we want to compare ourselves with? Is that the benchmark for competition? Is that what the government of the day is saying that we should compare ourselves with, the lowest cost possible regardless of the circumstances, the exploited work forces, the unsafe conditions, the ships that disappear and the lives that are lost? Is that the sort of comparison?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are a civilised country. I would like to think we are. If we are going to make sensible comparisons, it is not with the lowest cost denominator. It is with those whom we think have also got a concept of civilisation in society. What these studies show is that we are well below the OECD cost. With regard to industrial disputes&mdash;the thing that the government says it has major concerns about&mdash;they are down from four per cent of ship days in 1982 to 0.19 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These results come about because of cooperation and a strategy that recognises that government has a role to steer the reform and to bring the parties together. Government has to contribute with the policy levers where it is necessary to get the commitment to investment. The present government's legislation today will dismantle that support. As a consequence of that dismantling we will see the scuttling of what has emerged as one of the great industry success stories in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are you doing it? Because you do not believe in supporting industry and you think that your ideological bent can be served by taking on the unions. Time will show that you are wrong. It will be demonstrated that our track record proves that our approach is the correct one.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this bill with some trepidation because there have been so many fine contributors to this debate, not the least being the contribution by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) earlier today. Of course, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have also heard from you as the member for Throsby and we know of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> your strong interest in this industry and your strong experience. I would like to make particular mention of the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) who, as you know, is a former minister in this area and a person who has taken particular interest in this industry. We hear a lot these days about more open and accountable government and bipartisan approaches and I can suggest to the Prime Minister that it might do him well to consider appointing the member for Shortland as the minister for shipping&mdash;there is nothing under the Westminster rules or traditions to prevent him from doing so. I would suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the appointment of the member for Shortland as the minister for shipping in this place might put a situation in place where we might see the retention of an industry very important to the economy, and we might see a commonsense approach to the industry rather than the union bashing exercise or the ideologically driven policy approach we are seeing from the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am appalled at the thought of the passing of this shipping legislation. It really poses the question, the same question that has been asked on a number of occasions by earlier speakers, of what this legislation is all about. Is it about creating a more efficient industry? Is it about promoting competitiveness within our own local industries? Is it really about this ideologically driven IR agenda we have before us? Is it about this squaring up approach of the government in terms of members of the Maritime Union of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The passing of this bill will sound the death knell for the Australian shipping industry. It will result in the loss of basic shipping investment and jobs, a general downgrading of the fleet and it will result in a situation of ships being registered in countries where shipping laws are less stringent than ours. Also, the environmental concerns associated with the poor standard of ships in our waters and ports should be of concern to us all. The outcomes of this legislation are horrendous and they remove Australia as a world shipping player.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The OECD endorses the worldwide practice of positive adjustment assistance in shipping. In real terms, positive adjustment assistance is about assisting industries to perform better. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1067"> Australia, finally, has legislation in place which meets the OECD endorsed levels of positive adjustment and assistance for the shipping industry but now the coalition government wants to repeal this legislation and put Australia back a few paces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is wrong with a bit of government assistance? Thankfully, many industries in my electorate enjoy government assistance, including the rural sector. In terms of the role of government, that is certainly what government is all about. Even the most right wing economists understand the benefits of positive adjustment assistance and all the major shipping nations have packages in place. By taking this assistance away the coalition government will be taking Australia well and truly out of the shipping race. There will not be any need to talk about the forces of competition and the level playing field because we will not be in the field at all. The fact of the matter is that shipping is an international business and we must maintain assistance that is on a par with the assistance that is provided by our competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A responsible government needs to continue to foster improvement in industry. We need to assist our industries to improve and compete. We need to protect our environment and our people employed in the shipping industry. We will not encourage a competitive shipping industry with this legislation; instead we will encourage a fleet of ships of convenience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this bill is that it is taking away a scheme that has worked very well. In its 1992&hyphen;93 report the transport department said that an internal evaluation of the shipping grants scheme proved that the scheme had played a vital role in the reforming of our shipping industry. It had assisted the upgrade of ships which in turn meant lower crewing numbers and improved productivity and efficiency. In 1980 the average crew on board Australian ships was 33 because of the scheme and, in high&hyphen;tech ships, this number has dropped to 18.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government argues that this legislation will force our shipping industry to be more competitive. This claim is simply a farce. This is a direct attack on the Maritime Union of Australia. It is a poor excuse for being able to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stand here in parliament and attack under privilege our crews and their representative body. Let me suggest that if life as a merchant sailor was so good then why aren't some of the coalition members looking to give it a go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the absolute rubbish being trotted out by the government about the MUA. Firstly, they say that the reform package has not produced results. However, Australian crew numbers have dropped and they are as good as, and in some cases better than, those operating in other OECD countries. There is no demarcation. Australian seafarers are internationally trained and these initiatives continue. The MUA has accepted and begun industry enterprise bargaining on a ship by ship basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easy to see that the coalition have not been in government for a long time. They want to treat the unions as they would have done 20 years ago. Unions are not the obstructionist, self&hyphen;serving, greedy bastard clubs that the coalition make them out to be. Unions are professional and representative bodies. They have talented people and deserve to be consulted and made part of the decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principles of international best practice are wasted on a coalition that wants to put Australia back on the industrial battleground. It is baiting the Australian unions into industrial warfare. The harmony which has been fostered and the measurable improvements which have been produced as a result of this legislation will be wiped out. How can you blame the unions for their aggression when they are being blatantly baited and defiled as an organisation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this place I have spoken at some length about regional development and, while I do not have a port or any direct participation in the shipping industry in my electorate, I do have close to my electorate the port of Newcastle. The port of Newcastle is the lifeblood of the Hunter Valley generally. Members do not need to be reminded of the efficiency gains that have been achieved in the port of Newcastle in recent years. It is a port of which we can be proud. We can also be proud of the Australian mariners who service <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1068"> that port and the role they play in the economic wellbeing of the Hunter generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has described himself as the most conservative leader this country has seen. Let me talk about that conservatism and what it means. Conservatives believe that government descends from high to keep erring people from harming one another. Secondly, they do not believe that government should be involved in social change. They do not believe that social improvement can come about by positive and conscious action. Conservatives believe that it is an unfortunate fact of life and of human nature that some people are better than others and that such superior people should be entrusted with guarding the values of institutions and of society that are inherited from the past. This is the philosophy of the Prime Minister and his colleagues in the cabinet. It is also the philosophy of the National Party's squattocracy. It is not the view of government that I hold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham (Mr Crean), speaking just before me, spoke a little about the role of government. The word `government' derives from a Greek word meaning to steer a ship. In the context of this debate that is most appropriate indeed. The implication is that the helmsman is in control. Only he has the knowledge and the expertise to ensure that the crew of the ship see their way safely to port. In this country, the people of our nation have entrusted the steering of the ship, the steering of the nation, to the people who are elected to this place. In this case, and indeed in many other cases of economic policy, this government is relinquishing that role. `Leave it all to the market,' they say, `It'll be okay. It is the level playing field,' they tell us, `It'll all be okay.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in an earlier debate, the level playing field really is a misnomer, and it is a misnomer particularly in the case of the shipping industry. How can we expect the Australian shipping industry to compete when all these other OECD nations are giving their industry the support they are? These other countries recognise the importance of the industry in terms of employment; they recognise the importance of the industry to our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> balance of payments account; they recognise the importance of the industry to our national security; and they recognise the importance of the industry to the economy generally. Why this government continues to relinquish this very important role&mdash;that is, the steering of this nation, the steering of its wellbeing&mdash;is beyond me. As so many earlier speakers have said, this legislation is really about a square&hyphen;up, this obsession the coalition has with what I describe as responsible members of the Maritime Union of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This industry is very much the lifeblood of our country. This industry plays a role within the environment. We cannot afford to open our coastal shipping, for example, to the ships of shame we have seen described in those reports that have been mentioned earlier in the day. I implore the government to reconsider their position on this. I implore the government to reopen the avenues of consultation with the Maritime Union of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I told the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, I believe that what we introduced in the legislation was consonant with what was contained in the policy document. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, apparently unlike the Labor Party, the coalition makes absolutely no excuse whatever for making a policy change which will prevent a situation arising where people come to this country on the basis that they have been sponsored and, as soon as they get here, go on the unemployment list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition may be happy with that arrangement and the Labor Party may be happy with that arrangement, but I can tell those members opposite that the Australian people are not happy with that arrangement. The Australian people are perfectly happy to support a measure which very clearly and very simply stops people coming to this country as immigrants on the basis of sponsorship and, after having that sponsorship undertaking immediately repudiated, going on the unemployment list. That situation is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As those opposite will know, many of the immigrant communities have unemployment levels of 50 to 60 per cent. We do not regard it as acceptable that people can have a sponsorship arrangement but, when they come to this country, that sponsorship arrangement is immediately broken, and people can go on the unemployment list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor members might think that is satisfactory, but I can tell you that the Australian community does not. The Australian community very strongly supports this measure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen reports today suggesting that the fairest way of ensuring that younger generations can afford to retire in financial security is to ensure that the federal government produces a balanced budget? Is the government taking action to ensure that it reduces its spending to match its income, or is the government prepared to spend more than it earns and let future generations deal with the problem?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1069" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. My attention has been drawn to a very interesting speech made yesterday by Mr Ian Macfarlane, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Mr Macfarlane assumed his position under the tenure not of this government but of the former government, so he cannot be regarded in any sense as being anything other than a completely neutral spokesman on these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Macfarlane made a number of very interesting observations about the ongoing debate about fiscal policy in this country. I draw the attention of everybody in the House to the following paragraph from his speech, when he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Spenders are often seen in the public debate as compassionate and generous people, and those who favour restraint as Scrooge&hyphen;like accountants. One could, however, equally view it as a contest between those who are willing to take advantage of the next generation and those who wish to protect it.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat this phrase. There is a distinction:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . between those who are willing to take advantage of the next generation and those who wish to protect it.</PARA>
<PARA>We are the ones who will protect it. This debate, with all of its bluster, will not alter that. This debate about fiscal consolidation concerns whether you are prepared to protect future generations or whether you are prepared to take advantage of them. If the opposition's track record in government is any guide, they belong to the group of people who are prepared to take advantage of future generations and not protect them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1070">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For five years, the Labor Party followed a policy of fiscal laxity. You failed to take advantage of the alleged economic upswing. You allowed public debt to accumulate. You left the fiscal position of this country in a highly vulnerable state. Instead of acknowledging that failure and recognising that you took advantage of future generations of Australians, you have sought refuge in trying to create an atmosphere of fear and loathing about the attempts of this government to achieve fiscal consolidation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Ian Macfarlane has done in his speech is expose the essential humbug of what you are about. He made a number of very pertinent observations. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of ways in which fiscal policy decisions taken by members of this generation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that is all members of this parliament&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">can impose a burden on future generations. The most obvious case is where recurrent spending runs ahead of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party would know all about that, because that is the inheritance you left to the incoming government. In your craven desire to take advantage of future generations, you allowed recurrent spending to run ahead of taxation. You knew there was a problem, but you took advantage of future generations. You sat on your hands and now you have the gall to insult the Australian people and pretend that there is no problem at all. You are revealed as a humbug and a failure.</PARA>

You have so few members in Queensland that there is only one wing in that state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I am fascinated that members of the frontbench should interject because, if it had not been for the support of the coalition, you would never have got your privatisation plans through the Senate. You know that and the Leader of the Opposition knows better than anybody else. He was the bloke who came cap in hand to me before the budget before last making certain that we would still support the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. You consulted me about the sale of the Commonwealth Bank before the Treasurer consulted his own backbench. So you do not interject in this House with any authority at all on the question of privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very interested watching that interview with the Australian Democrats leader that she then went on to say that, as an alternative source of revenue in order to fund the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, there ought to be introduced, in effect, as the member says, a seven per cent tax on Telstra. The introduction of that would come at the worst possible time for Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra has already become&mdash;it had already become under the previous government&mdash;a milch cow. It was paying a 55 per cent dividend rate, a special additional $100 million dividend rate. It is going to go up to 60 per cent next year. What Senator Kernot's proposal would do would be to take another $200 million a year out of Telstra at the very time it is paying these high dividends and at the very time it has committed itself to a very extensive capital development program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say particularly to members who represent rural and regional Australia&mdash;and that is exclusively, of course, to members on the government side of the House, because the Labor Party does not have any representatives left in rural and regional Australia as I cannot see one single Labor Party member representing a rural or regional area of Australia&mdash;</PARA>

That seven per cent tax would directly threaten the infrastructure and capital investment program of Telstra. Senator Kernot is proposing it at the worst possible time because in the first half of this financial year Telstra reported a negative cash flow of $800 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are being invited to treat seriously a proposition from the Leader of the Australian Democrats that, at a time when you have an $800 million negative cash flow, at a time when you are paying a 55 rising to 60 per cent dividend, at a time when you have a $100 million special dividend, at a time when you are making large capital investments to extend the services of Telstra to rural and regional areas of Australia&mdash;including the very important ISDN and digitisation program which was committed by the coalition in my speech to the National Farmers Federation last year&mdash;and at a time when Telstra is delivering these benefits to the bush, we cut the archery of that support program by putting an unfair additional financial burden on Telstra.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the member for Gilmore for asking me that question. I foreshadow to the House that the workplace relations bill when introduced tomorrow will, amongst its objects, include the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assisting employees to balance their work and family responsibilities effectively through the development of mutually beneficial work practices with employers.</PARA>
<PARA>I am very happy to say that one of the many hallmarks of this legislation will be that it will usher in a new and exciting era for both men and women in the work force to more effectively combine their work and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that those who sit opposite, who over the years have been long and loud in their protestations on behalf of Australian women, are not only embarrassed at the pathetic representation of the number of women in this parliament on the Labor Party side but are also embarrassed that it is a Liberal government that is going to introduce a measure that thousands of women in the work force will applaud. For the first time some respectability will be given to the notion of permanent part&hyphen;time work. We are going to entrench in the legislation a regime that will enable men and women&mdash;particularly women&mdash;to combine their work and family responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have raved on for years about how you have represented the interests of Australian workers but what you have done with your centralised wage fixing system, by becoming a footnote to the ACTU in these matters, is create a situation where many women are denied the opportunity of combining their work and family responsibilities. In many cases they have to make a choice between being permanently out of the work force and being a full&hyphen;time participant in the work force. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Instead, so many women, when their children are young, want through part&hyphen;time work to combine their work and family responsibility. We are going to allow them to do that in a free, flexible and unfettered way, and in a fashion that you always denied them. You carried on as though you were their friend, but you were only the friend of the organisation that the member for Batman used to run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very happy to say to the House that one of the many reforms that will be contained in the workplace relations bill will usher in a new era enabling the women of this country to effectively and beneficially combine their work and their family responsibilities. It will not lead, as one ACTU spokesman so stupidly said yesterday, to the casualisation of the Australian work force. What it is going to do in fact is enshrine as respectable the principle of permanent part-time work and it will give unparalleled opportunities to combine work and family responsibilities. It represents the modern, thoroughly contemporary approach of the coalition to allowing men and women in Australia to more effectively combine their family and their workplace responsibilities.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of major delays caused to the settlement of compensation and personal injury cases following legislation passed last year by the Labor government? What hardship has been caused by Labor's legislative mess?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1077" SPEAKER="Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP" NAMEID="8E4" ELECTORATE="Chisholm" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Health and Family Services" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the issue the honourable member raises. It relates to the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act, passed in the dying days of the Keating government. The act came into effect on 1 February this year. Under the legislation a person cannot receive a compensation settlement until the Health Insurance Commission has determined whether or not there are any spent benefits that it is owed. This is supposed to prevent double dipping. This is something the then opposition supported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the legislation has led to particular problems, and I will give honourable members three examples. A person in Canberra had a $300,000 payout delayed while the Health Insurance Commission determined that it was owed nothing. A Brisbane person had a payout of $1 million delayed while it was determined there was a $98 bill to the Health Insurance Commission. Another person in Brisbane had their payout of $442,000 delayed while the Health Insurance Commission determined nothing was owing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are we having these sorts of delays? The very simple answer is that the previous government did not think to consult the Health Insurance Commission as to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> logistics of going through the claims. It was predicted that there would be 25,000 claims in New South Wales. In the 3&half; months, we have received 45,000 claims in New South Wales alone. There are extraordinary delays in people receiving their compensation payouts. The whole system is in chaos and people who have taken contingent liabilities, such as a mortgage on the expectation of a payout, are now risking losing their home. Because of a lack of consultation, no thought was given to how this would actually work in operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday I met with the Bar Council, the Insurance Council of Australia and the Law Society of New South Wales to discuss this issue. We have reached broad agreement as to how this situation might be fixed. It is going to require a legislative base. In the interim, the Health Insurance Commission has put staff on overtime and it will also take note of any special cases of hardship. But these delays are causing hardship to many thousands of people around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems, though, that I am not the only person concerned by these delays. A kind person has passed me copies of the minutes of the ALP Left caucus meeting yesterday.

This is a less qualified and more pro&hyphen;active commitment than has been the case before by the United States. The United States armed forces will discontinue the use of so-called dumb, or long&hyphen;lived, antipersonnel landmines immediately, except on the Korean peninsula and for training purposes. The rest of the US inventory of dumb APL mines will be destroyed by 1999. While the US has not gone as far as Australia in terms of its interim measures&mdash;it has not banned or suspended altogether antipersonnel landmines used by its armed forces&mdash;its new policy does bring the considerable power of influence of the United States behind the campaign for a total ban on antipersonnel landmines.</PARA>

We are delighted that the United States has come a long way towards the position annunciated by this government.

ASTEC has used the processes of foresight to evaluate the science and technology needs of Australia through to the year 2010.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of a hectic visit to Japan and Indonesia last week, I pursued a number of trade policy issues to seek to make further advances with trade liberalisation, some of which were commenced by the former Minister for Trade, and I acknowledge that. With regard to regional issues, I am pleased to advise the House that both the Japanese government and the Indonesian government have reiterated their commitment to the individual action plan process of APEC. Those plans in draft form are heading to the officers' meeting at Cebu which will take place this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to multilateral issues, both senior officials and ministerial officials of the Japanese government and the Indonesian government again committed themselves to the process of liberalisation with regard to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1083"> WTO round. Australians have legitimate concerns over questions of backsliding on agriculture, on completing the unfinished agenda of the Uruguay Round. These are matters which I pursued at various levels and, indeed, obtained some clarification on as we build towards the December Singapore summit, the first ministerial round following the signing of the Uruguay Round at Marrakech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On bilateral issues, as part of addressing the market share circumstance, a number of breakthroughs were achieved. Members opposite might like to recall that the Japanese economy is 14 times the size of the Australian economy. It has seven times the population and is 14 times the GDP size. It is one which offers very good opportunities for a very diverse range of Australian exporters in respect of rice, high&hyphen;tech ferries, expanding legal services and the like. All of these matters were pursued, including the opening of a home building model village which reflects the increase in building material exports to Japan and which I was very happy to promote during my visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The somewhat dismissive attitude to two of our key Asian trading partners marks the Labor Party down again in terms of their track record. During the visit I was able to announce, in liaison with the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, a 38 per cent boost in air services between Australia and Indonesia. Once again we have it right in terms of spreading it around, away from Sydney, with 10 ports of entry being granted. In relation to that boost to air services, I also took the opportunity to officially open a new Qantas office in Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, the coalition government is about a systematic set of regional working visits to further boost our trading circumstance, our export performance and the diversity of Australian exports.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government certainly does believe that training arrangements are an important element for ensuring the job readiness of Australians&mdash;young and not so young&mdash;but particularly young Australians. We include in our legislative package a series of measures designed to help young Australians&mdash;one which has been referred to already in this House&mdash;and that is in respect of junior wage rates. That is a system in place now. Labor's system was to bring an end to that as at 22 June next year, which would have meant, if it had been implemented, that a lot of young Australians would have lost their jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the training area, we see a particular need to make provision for Australian workplace agreements and certified agreements to incorporate new flexible training arrangements developed under the MAAT scheme. These provisions will ensure that trainees receive an appropriate rate of pay in conjunction with an approved form of training. Under these new arrangements, it will be necessary to identify the time actually spent in productive work vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis the time spent in training. A traineeship must be an approved traineeship, that is, it must be approved by an appropriate training authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benchmark for the rate of pay will be the hourly rate of pay for the equivalent classification in the relevant award. So, for juniors employed under such arrangements, the relevant classification will be the applicable junior rate from the relevant award. For an adult trainee, the rate will be the rate in the relevant adult classification in the relevant <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> award. That has been the traditional means by which trainee rates of pay have been set, and we will not be departing from that traditional approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where a traineeship is a national wage traineeship, the relevant rate of pay will be the wage rate specified in the national training wage award. This will ensure that trainees under the federal government's new flexible training agenda will receive an appropriate rate of pay based on the applicable award rates in tandem with formally approved training conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that all adds up to for young people is a far more flexible system. It really does give young people the chance of training opportunities in conjunction with work that will secure them a better future&mdash;and that is why this bill will properly be known in many parts of Australia as the jobs bill, the jobs package, because we have been genuinely concerned about the high rate of youth unemployment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 13 years the interests of young people were put to one side whilst the now opposition were principally focused on their own political interest&mdash;a comment which has been made even by people on their own side. They were more interested in saving their own political necks than they were about the fact that a lot of young people were missing out on opportunities. It is a disgrace that we have such high rates of unemployment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make it even worse, they have, in the existing legislation, a proposition&mdash;until it is removed by us&mdash;that would cost up to 200,000 young people their jobs. We do treat this matter very seriously, and I say to the opposition that, if they are to have any credibility on this issue, they ought to, just for once, put aside their own political interests and think about the young people who deserve a fair go. These are far more flexible arrangements, but they are fair. They provide people with proper protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These agreements will have to be approved by a training authority, but it also takes us away from the very rigid constraints set up by the previous government which, of course, provided in part an opportunity for the training arrangements to be a basis of recruitment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1085"> into the trade union movement&mdash;not in the interests necessarily of pursuing the interests of young people but actually pushing your own political agenda and the agenda of the trade union movement. As usual, you are more interested in your relationship with the ACTU than young people.</PARA>

<ELECTORATE> (Sydney)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.25 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very clear that Australia's higher education sector is permeated by an overwhelming sense that the barbarians are at the gates. Initially, there was a degree of incredulity towards this government's performance in the higher education sector. Incredulity has now been replaced by consternation and panic. When the Vandals, the Visigoths, the Vanstones and the Kemps have control and some say over Australia's higher education policy, it is obviously a very serious situation indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nature of the reaction is without precedent in what those involved in the higher education sector have had to say. The key trigger to much of this public comment has been the notorious briefing dinner that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, attended with members of the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee on Monday of last week. At that dinner, when questioned about the likely magnitude of cuts to the sector, she rather flippantly said&mdash;and these are the words she used, which have been relayed to me by a couple of people who were there&mdash;`How about 12 per cent for starters?' She then erupted into a kind of maniacal giggling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the sort of performance that we are getting from a person who has responsibility <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for one of the most important areas of government activity in this country. The reaction from the higher education sector is as would be predicted. It has been one of panic, concern and anxiety about what is going to happen. A great edifice has been created over a number of years. We have a substantial higher eduction sector that involves the expenditure of some $5.3 billion in Commonwealth money, but we now have a situation where most universities derive substantial income from other sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that has been achieved over the past couple of decades is now placed at risk by the bull&hyphen;in&hyphen;a&hyphen;china&hyphen;shop approach of this new minister. It is worth going to some of the comments that the vice&hyphen;chancellors made after that particular performance. The AVCC president, Professor Fay Gale of the University of Western Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think what you have got is a group of vice&hyphen;chancellors in a state of shock not knowing how they're going to deal with these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have never had to face this kind of thing before and not of this order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cuts of the scale now anticipated would trigger cancellation of many university courses, drastic staff retrenchments, national academic industrial action and could force some research programs to shut down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would mean greatly enlarged class sizes&mdash;one of the very shortcoming the Coalition used in its higher education campaign during the election.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Mal Logan, the retiring Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of Monash University, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cuts of this magnitude have the potential to take universities back to the pre&hyphen;Whitlam days of elite higher education.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Logan attacked Senator Vanstone for having `no vision whatsoever' for the future of universities in five years. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">She has no idea in my view as to what she wants to achieve in the university system and that's very worrying.</PARA>
<PARA>I will quote from a couple of other vice&hyphen;chancellors, just to round it off. Professor Ian Chubb, Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of Flinders University, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are absolutely unbelievably annoyed . . . I think to myself could there be a more stupid approach than the one they are pushing? <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1087"> </PARA>
<PARA>Professor John Niland, Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is playing with live ammunition . . . a university sector in turmoil in Australia will very quickly lead to the undermining of goodwill (overseas).</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Dean Terrell, Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the ANU, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(The issue) is just as important to those people who are watching from various parts of Asia . . . our quality, choice and diversity will be under question.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Michael Osborne, Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of La Trobe University, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the worst moment that higher education has ever faced . . . this is going to lead to turmoil, worry, stress and hell for just about everybody.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>If that is not an overwhelming reaction, I do not know what is. Since that time Senator Vanstone has tried to allay some of those concerns in a most ham&hyphen;fisted way. She partly sought to deny having made some of the statements that she clearly made to the meeting of the AVCC. At no stage has any suggestion been made by the government that they will adhere to the very explicit, black-letter commitment they made before the last election to maintain university operating grants and research grants at least at their current level. In the follow&hyphen;up letter Senator Vanstone wrote to the AVCC to try to hose things down, she made no commitment to that pre-election promise. She belongs to the party that claimed they would adhere to their election promises; they would take them seriously and act with integrity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard all this talk about $8 billion black holes. What has to be stressed is the questions charged to both the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Treasurer (Mr Costello) before the election and on a number of occasions after the election. They are: what if it were to turn out that the fiscal position is not as you understood the situation? What would take priority, maintenance of your election commitments or achievement of a budget balance? The Prime Minister on the John Laws program and the Treasurer on a couple of occasions affirmed that, in those circumstances, priority would be given to keeping faith with election commitments, even if that meant deferring the achievement <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of a balanced budget. Those statements were very clear commitments to the Australian people before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find extraordinary these pathetic attempts by Senator Vanstone to deny having made the suggestions that she did make. The vice&hyphen;chancellors who were there have explicitly denied her version of events or her account of what she said. I saw a report yesterday in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> on an unrelated matter&mdash;that is, Senator Vanstone's speech last month to the National Conference of the Australian Association of Education of the Gifted and Talented in Adelaide. The report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Organisers and participants of the conference said they were embarrassed by Senator Vanstone's bitter and anti&hyphen;intellectual statements to an audience of world leaders in education.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the person in the Australian government who has responsibility for this area. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Vanstone said yesterday the report of her speech was an "outrageous misrepresentation" . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The conference organiser, Dr Marie McCann, confirmed the accuracy of her comments. They were transcribed by Southern Cross University education lecturer John Geake, so a careful transcript was kept. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr McCann, who is also president of the Australian Association of Gifted and Talented Education, said she was disappointed and embarrassed by Senator Vanstone's speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"She showed no knowledge and quite frankly did harm to the field," she said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I literally stood up and removed the Senator from the stand&mdash;I had to close it down."</PARA>
<PARA>This is the sort of performance we are getting from this minister. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland University of Technology education lecturer Dr Jim Watters said the 200 academics, teachers and parents at the conference were "universally incensed" by Senator Vanstone's comments.</PARA>
<PARA>Their concern, outrage and anger has echoed through all parts of the higher education sector; it has not been confined to just the vice&hyphen;chancellors. The student organisations and the academic and general staff organisations are mobilising nationally. We are seeing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1088"> a huge reaction from that sector, as well there should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What do you say about somebody whose commitment to achieving stability of funding and a stable financial base for that sector is epitomised by flagging the possibility of 12 per cent cuts, erupting into laughter and, when the inevitable furore emerges, making these pathetic attempts to deny having ever said the things that she clearly did say?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is at stake here? We are talking about Australia's higher education sector. The same minister has responsibility for the schools sector, vocational education, labour market programs and employment programs. What could be more important to the future of this country than those programs? Today's debate is about the higher education sector in particular because we now have a sense of what we can expect from this minister. Our higher education system is a huge national asset. It is not only critically important to the advancement of knowledge and the development of our culture in a broad sense; it is an enormously important economic asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of speakers and commentators have referred to the significance of educational exports as part of our service sector, stating that they are now approaching the magnitude of significance of wheat, coal and our traditional commodity exports. Obviously the growth rate in those areas is substantially faster. I refer to Professor Michael Porter, from Harvard University, who wrote the seminal work <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Competitive Advantage of Nations</EMPHASIS>, which is a definitive study of the factors that determine international competitiveness. He had this to say about the significance of the education and training sector:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is little doubt from our research that education and training are decisive in national competitive advantage.</PARA>
<PARA>He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Education and training constitute perhaps the single greatest long-term leverage point available to all levels of government in upgrading industry.</PARA>
<PARA>He also stressed the importance of all parts of the education and training system and said that a strong research university sector is a critical element in national competitive advan <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tage. The significance of that was well recognised by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government over its 13 years in office made enormous achievements in education and training and, in particular, in higher education. If we look at participation rates when we came to office, the number of university students was around 350,000. When we left office in 1995 the number was over 600,000&mdash;a huge increase. If we look at the participation rates for the 17&hyphen; to 19-year age group&mdash;obviously the school leaver cohort&mdash;we had a 60 per cent increase during our period of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that corresponded with a huge boost to government funding of higher education to support this expansion and strengthening of research programs and so forth. In terms of equity, the previous government placed an enormous emphasis on increasing participation across the board and, in particular, tried to ensure that disadvantaged groups got a share of that increased participation. The government's equity programs&mdash;which were a central element of the profile negotiations we had with higher education institutions&mdash;and the specific higher education equity program achieved very significant changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal participation rates have increased enormously by around 50 per cent, even in the period between 1990 and 1995. Participation of women in non-traditional areas has improved very considerably. Participation by people from non-English speaking backgrounds has improved very significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this is under threat by coalition government policies and the probable&mdash;or certain, I would say&mdash;proposal that we will see in the next budget to substantially raise the level of HECS contribution. We were very concerned at the introduction of HECS to make sure we did it in a way that did not constitute a deterrent to people from low income backgrounds participating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In ensuring the quality of higher education, the initiatives that the former government introduced over the last several years have been enormously important. It is very important to bear in mind that, quite apart from across-the-board cuts in operating grants, which we are likely to see, the coalition even <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1089"> before the election said that they would eliminate the so-called discretionary funds. Those discretionary funds were very much about providing a pool of funds to support the development of quality assurance initiatives in higher education, to support innovations and enhancements in approaches to teaching, as well as a whole raft of other things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition have been very sceptical about quality initiative, so presumably they think it is all right to eliminate any support for that kind of activity. But I refer honourable members to the 1994 report that the Committee for Quality Assurance in Higher Education published in March 1995. That report reviewed the impact of the government's quality assurance initiative, and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The response of the system to the review process has been overwhelmingly positive, with significant improvements noted across the sector. The achievements in the second round of reviews represent improvement against the evidence collected in 1993 on quality in the sector. In particular, there has been a marked improvement in quality assurance policies and practices in teaching and learning.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee and its review teams were impressed by the magnitude and extent of the attitudinal and procedural change evident in 1994 across the higher education system.</PARA>
<PARA>Comments have been made by various people involved in higher education on the impact of the quality review. I refer to the higher education supplement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 8 March 1995 which refers to a number of respected experts in the field. I quote one of those experts:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The good administrations have used the leverage of the quality money to actually push their institutions in ways that would have taken 15 to 20 years&mdash;we have seen the most extraordinary shift in ground as a result of the process&mdash;which has been an unqualified success . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These are very important initiatives which were implemented by the previous government in terms of participation, equity of access and measures to enhance the quality of the system. All this is placed at massive risk by this bull&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;china&hyphen;shop approach manifested by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government's policies in this area are already having a severely detrimental effect on confidence in the system and on its standing throughout the region. There have been a number of reports of concern spreading throughout Asian countries that are the source of much of the student income that the sector has been able to achieve. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say how pleased I am that the member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) should put this MPI on the paper. It gives the government a chance to correct some myths.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Sydney can quote all the vice&hyphen;chancellors in the world, but if they are all labouring under the same misapprehension it does not amount to an argument. A lot of people, as we know, are scared of ghosts, but that does not mean that ghosts really exist. Listening to the member for Sydney was like listening to one of the last commissars who turns up in current Moscow, looks at what is happening and says, `Wow, let's go back to the good old days of Leonid Brezhnev.' It was like looking at one of the dinosaurs that might have come back to the modern world and said, `Where have all the swamps gone?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that we are in charge, that mob is not, and what we are doing is fixing up the mess that 13 years of Labor have left for higher education. While members opposite pose as the friends of higher education, it is important to remember exactly what Labor did. Labor over 10 years cut real recurrent funding per student by 10 per cent. Labor fiddled with HECS in every single budget handed down since 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am absolutely delighted to see that members opposite have suddenly been converted to the cause of dotting every i and crossing every t of their election promises. But, by gee, this conversion to virtue comes very late indeed! What we see opposite is a kind of strange schizophrenia afflicting the Labor Party. In opposition they are old&hyphen;style socialists: every program is sacred, every cent of government spending is sacrosanct. That is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1090"> how they went on throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened then? They got into government. And what happened then? They all became ultra capitalists. The former Prime Minister would boast day in and day out in this chamber how much he had cut government spending. He used to boast about how he had reduced the wages of workers. Peter Walsh, the former Minister for Finance, got up there and said, `If you can't cut $4 billion out of government spending, there's something wrong with you.' The fact of the matter is that under the previous government&mdash;the government which now boasts about all its spending and all the great things it did&mdash;workers were $50 a week worse off in their real disposable household income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting. You talk about tertiary education. The former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, used to talk about the former Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, and how he had betrayed his class by moving into Woollahra. And what does the former Prime Minister do? He himself goes into a $2.2 million house in Woollahra. But that is not all. That is not the best of it, is it? The best of it is that the former Prime Minister used to talk about the former Leader of the Opposition so sneeringly, so condescendingly, as the `Visiting Professor'. What has happened to the former Prime Minister? He has rushed off to become a visiting professor himself. All I can say is that members opposite&mdash;who have suddenly developed this almighty affection for higher education, right or wrong; higher education, good or bad&mdash;are scared that, if anything happens to higher education, the former Prime Minister might want to come back and join them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stressed before and after the election that the most important thing is to keep faith with the promises that politicians make. Let me say, of the commitments that we made: we made them, we meant them and we will keep faith with them, because this government takes politicians' promises very seriously. We believe that truth is not some plastic throwaway disposable commodity, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> way it has been treated for too long by members opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem, of course, is that this government has inherited the $8 billion Beazley budget black hole. This is the only threat to university education in this country. It does not come from the coalition government; it comes from Kim Beazley. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs is not immune from the ravages wreaked by the former Minister for Finance, now Leader of the Opposition. Of the $2.1 billion allocated to labour market programs in the current financial year, do you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that $2 billion had been spent by this government in a pathetic and disgraceful attempt to buy votes and win the election? It is Kim Beazley who is responsible for any problems in the sector.</PARA>

It is also important that members of the media realise that the Prime Minister means what he says.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1091">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will digress for a moment. Not long after being elected I was given by kind friends polling data which ranked the ethics and honesty of various professions. Doctors ranked 50 per cent or more, lawyers ranked 30 per cent, stockbrokers ranked 15 per cent and, I am afraid to say, politicians ranked only 10 per cent. As a former journalist I was dismayed to see that newspaper journalists ranked seven per cent for ethics and honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Average people believe politicians more than they believe what they read in the newspapers. Vice&hyphen;chancellors and members opposite have to be a bit careful about the people they are getting into bed with and the stories they believe. You will also be pleased to note that, in the few brief weeks since the election, the ranking of politicians in terms of ethics and honesty has already gone up by 40 per cent&mdash;from nine per cent to 13 per cent. The higher education sector must participate in the general belt-tightening, but the point to make is that it will do so in a way that is consistent with our election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One good thing that has come out of the alarmism and scaremongering of members opposite is that it has flushed out some constructive thinking by academics. I refer members to a statement by Professor Aitkin, the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of Canberra. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem now . . . is that we rely on a funding mechanism from another era. In the days when an elite few attended university, the benefits to the rest of society from their higher knowledge were considered great enough to justify paying for it through general taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When it gets to be a big proportion [of the population going to university] that is the nutty rationale.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the condemnation of what the previous government now claims to stand for. Professor Cliff Blake, who speaks for the vice&hyphen;chancellors on industrial matters, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . micro-economic reform really hasn't impacted on the universities in the way it has impacted elsewhere in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We still do have a lot of work practices which one would have to question. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Look at what the vice&hyphen;chancellors have had to say about the 13 years of Labor government policies. Professor Ian Harper stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This gives rise to the anomalous situation in which foreign students can, in principle, "buy" a place at an Australian university (provided they meet the academic entrance criteria) whereas our own sons and daughters may not.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More often than not, the present arrangements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the arrangements put in place by members opposite&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">entrench privilege by offering subsidised university places to those who already have a lot going for them.</PARA>
<PARA>The government does not endorse any of those comments. The government welcomes the creative and constructive thinking which is now being engaged in by members of the academic community&mdash;creative and constructive thinking which has a lot more going for it than simply coming out with the begging bowl and seeking to become permanent pensioners of the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we said before the election was that we would give our higher education sector more autonomy, more diversity and more flexibility. That is a promise that we definitely intend to keep. Good universities are the hallmark of a civilised society. Our universities are heirs to a great tradition&mdash;a tradition going back to Greece and Rome; a tradition that builds on the great teachers of our culture, Moses, Jesus, Plato and Aristotle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our universities are the repositories of all the glories of Western civilisation and the last thing that this  government would do is hurt them. I should point out that, if there is one group of institutions that should be capable of running their own affairs, it is the universities. If there is one group of people who should be capable of putting the national interest first, it is university leaders&mdash;vice&hyphen;chancellors. If there is one group of Australian youth who should be capable of wearing the mortarboard rather than a cloth cap, it is our students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House are proud of our universities. They are doing a good job. Let us be under no illusions as to what they are. They are elite institutions. It is worth pointing out that the Whitlam abolition of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1092"> fees has not made our universities any more egalitarian. Just a couple of years ago a major piece of research showed that the top 20 per cent of families get $60 a week more in non&hyphen;cash benefits through the higher education system than any other group. Let us not pretend that those opposite stand for the poor and the oppressed. They stand for the middle class privileged today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Universities are elite institutions and each and every one of our universities should be striving to be the very best of the best. What we are doing is giving those institutions more opportunities to build on their strengths. We want to explode the bureaucratic shackles, the bureaucratic straitjacket, that the previous government put on our institutions of higher learning. The last thing we want is to see our academics, our students and our vice&hyphen;chancellors turned into pensioners of government. The last thing we need is universities reporting to DEETYA, a bunch of bureaucrats in Canberra, in the same way that state owned enterprises might have done in Moscow when they reported to Gosplan in the old days of the Soviet Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not need socialism in one sector any more, and the best of the university vice&hyphen;chancellors are standing up and saying it publicly. That is what you do not like. You do not like the fact that so many of the vice&hyphen;chancellors did not accept the bribes that were given to them by the previous government. They are standing up now and saying, `Give us the freedom to do a better job. Give us the tools and we will do the job you want.' That is what this government is going to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is really prompting this mock outrage and these crocodile tears from members opposite is not some devotion to or respect for higher education; it is their slavish adherence to the union line. They are not acting according to the best interests of students, teachers or leaders in a university; they are acting according to the best interests of the university unions. It happens all the time. Underneath their rhetoric you discern the message of the cloth cap and the overlordship of the union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They want universities to be factories, not academes. They want universities to be giant <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sausage machines turning out grey functionaries and technocrats for state sponsored industries. Above all else they are trying to get away from the consequences of what they have done. They are trying to sheet home to the new government the blame for a situation that has been 13 years in the building and which is fundamentally caused by the $8 billion Beazley black hole. They are not interested in giving universities freedom to innovate; they want to impose on them the freedom&mdash;if that is the right word&mdash;to stagnate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mock outrage coming from members opposite on this issue is proof, if any was needed, of that famous and notorious cry of Kim Beazley Sr, who said, `When I joined the Labor Party it was the cream of the working class. As I leave the Labor Party it has become the dregs of the middle class.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>The parliamentary secretary is leaving the chamber because he has no interest in the matter. The Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of Deakin University said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an air of disbelief around the university today, that this sort of thing could happen and undo all the hard work of the past.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the judgment that the Australian vice&hyphen;chancellors have made about your government, a government which, although it has been in power for such a short time, has managed to make such a mess of the higher education situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to address in this debate the thing that concerns me most, and that is the impact that the government's initiatives will have upon people in Queensland. Under Labor, Queensland gained very substantially in tertiary education funding. This year we have seen a significant growth in tertiary places in Queensland as a direct result of initiatives taken by then Minister Crean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact of life that we have put into the budget process&mdash;into the forecast and into the current financial year&mdash;growth which would see additional places. If you include the pipeline growth of people going through the university system, there will be an additional 7,600 places for Queensland. That is an increase of 7,600 places out of a total national growth of just 10,145. Queensland was the big winner from the initiatives that the Labor government took last year in tertiary education. It is very substantial growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We find now that the Liberal government has decided to play games with the Australian universities and with the future research and educational standing of our nation through the taunting by the Minister for Employment, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) of the vice-chancellors. There has been some illuminating coverage of this in the media, to which the shadow minister, the member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin), referred in his presentation earlier and which I wish to make quick reference to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was reported as telling the vice&hyphen;chancellors in a `jocular, even teasing tone' words to the effect, `I could say a figure of five per cent, I could say a figure of 12 per cent,' and then laughingly adding, `You should not have heard that.' The minister is not even being serious with the vice&hyphen;chancellors about this most important matter, thinking it is something of a game to talk about cuts of the magnitude of 12 per cent to the tertiary sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you that the vice&hyphen;chancellors do not regard it as a game; nor do the people of Queensland, who know that the cuts will hit first where they are easiest applied. Where they will be easiest applied is in Queensland, where the funding was for future growth. It is much easier to deny future funds to Queensland than to extract money from those establishments that are already in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposals to introduce 12 per cent cuts in tertiary education will have a very significant impact on a lot of young people, particularly in Queensland. I just want to make a couple of references also to the minister's comments about this matter and the standing which she has managed to establish for herself in this most important field. The minister was recently addressing a conference organised by the Australian Association of Education of the Gifted and Talented. She sought to defend the cuts that had been reported in tertiary funding. In an article of 21 May, dealing with this matter, Dr McCann is referred to as saying that she was disappointed and embarrassed by Senator Vanstone's speech. Dr McCann said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She showed no knowledge and quite frankly did harm to the field . . . I literally stood up and removed the Senator from the stand&mdash;I had to close it down.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of position which the new Liberal minister has brought to this field. It is an important matter.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1094">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder where all those voices are of those Queensland Liberal&hyphen;National Party people who were swept into their seats on the tide of the 2 March election, none of whom are in the chamber at the moment to talk on this issue&mdash;all those members of the Liberal Party and the National Party who now have campuses in their electorates or where, under our proposals, there is an intention to build campuses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to mention a couple of those because it is not just the recurrent funds for places that are under threat; it is, very particularly, funds for new campuses and new universities. Queensland, with its growth in population, stood to gain most of any of the states out of that. Now, threatened by the new Liberal minister, it stands to lose the most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), a National Party member, is not here although $4 million in funding for capital works in Gladstone is under threat. The new National Party member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) is not here&mdash;there was to be some $5&half; million for a new campus in Rockhampton. Griffith University was to be putting a campus on the Gold Coast, the largest growth area in the country. The Liberal member for that area, the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), is not here, although there is $7 million of funding involved. At Leichhardt there was to be a Cairns campus for the James Cook University with $5.7 million in funds. The Liberal member for that area is not here. The Sunshine Coast is one of the fastest growing areas of the country. The Liberal member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) is not here, but there is some $11 million worth of funding at risk for new campus facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ipswich, the extended western suburbs area of Brisbane, is an important area which has been neglected for many years in terms of the needs of its young people for tertiary education. The Independent Liberal member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is not here to defend some $8&half; million in funding for that campus. At Wide Bay some $1&half; million was proposed for the University of South Queensland to establish new campus facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are important developments the people of Queensland deserve. They are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important developments which are about to be denied by a Liberal government, set upon massive cuts to funding in the tertiary sector which have clearly been described by those in the sector as the worst situation that tertiary institutions have faced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an intended outcome of these cuts that we will see a change in the nature of university access. We will see a reversion to the days&mdash;and the vice&hyphen;chancellors have noted that&mdash;when the opportunities for those from low and middle income families to aspire to have their children enter and succeed in universities will be curtailed.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SU5">Mr VAILE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Reports that the Commonwealth has imposed a freeze on its funding are completely false. The 1996 operating grants, capital grants and amounts to quality funds will be paid in full. Also, all growth places announced in 1996 will be provided. Last week I had the opportunity of representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) at the opening of the campus of the Southern Cross University in Port Macquarie. Part of the information and speech provided to me on behalf of the minister on that very important day in Port Macquarie indicated that a further $5.5 million will be made available in 1997&hyphen;98 from the capital development pool for Coffs Harbour, Port Macquarie and the university centres across northern New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that the member for Brisbane just ran through the names of all those regional campuses in Queensland and he does not know whether they are going to be cut or not. If the opposition believe everything they read in the paper, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) indicated, instead of relying on the facts and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the evidence, they are in for a very long stay on the opposition benches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been made abundantly clear in this place and outside that on coming to government the coalition faced an enormous problem as far as the financial situation of the Commonwealth was concerned. The former Labor government&mdash;in their own words&mdash;made a deliberate policy choice of creating an $8 billion budget deficit. They made that choice; they have admitted that. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has admitted that. That is what we are left with. But what was not made clear to us nor to the people of Australia was that exact budgetary situation prior to the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So all areas of government expenditure are under review, but there have been no commitments and no announcements made as far as the claim of any cuts to higher education is concerned. So there has been no announcement of cuts to higher education. The vice&hyphen;chancellors, those who are speaking out and have been reported by opposition speakers in this MPI, and the opposition have been very successful in planting stories in the press to the effect that major cuts are planned. The fact is that there has been no announcement of any cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vice&hyphen;chancellors have been told that they cannot be quarantined from the need to achieve savings to repair the budget black hole left by Labor. I have had extensive discussions with the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the Southern Cross University in this regard. We have to identify the need to look at a different way of providing the much needed services in higher education that we all aspire to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government's commitment to higher education still stands as it stood prior to the election. The government's fundamental commitment to the higher education sector has not been altered by the need to repair the $8 billion Beazley black hole. I will read to you the coalition government's recognition of the role and importance particularly of regional universities in its higher education policy document. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government does not believe that social and geographic factors should act as a barrier to higher education for appropriately qualified students. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1096"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition recognises that the development of new approaches to open learning has facilitated access to higher education for a whole range of new students who might not otherwise have had the opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move of education and training from the lecture theatre and the classroom into workplaces, homes and community access centres is having a marked impact on educational opportunities in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Open learning facilities allow students to remain in their communities and yet be supported with a full range of support services. They do not have to take leave from work to pursue learning.</PARA>
<PARA>What it is all about is finding better ways to provide those educational facilities to that very important generation of Australians. So this government is still very committed to higher education. It is committed to finding better ways of providing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You heard the parliamentary secretary read from a number of media reports. Some of those same vice&hyphen;chancellors I mentioned earlier were indicating that there is room for improvement in the delivery of these services and there is room for improvement to better utilise the capital infrastructure that we have in higher education in Australia today. We have to keep searching for a better utilisation of that infrastructure. We have to keep searching for better means of providing that much valued higher education in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What of the previous Labor government's record on higher education? The previous Labor government's record on higher education is certainly not unsullied. They come in here very sanctimoniously and say that they are the knights in shining armour wanting to protect the higher education system in Australia. But what of their record? The previous government, in searching around for savings in past budgets, have sought changes in the higher education contribution scheme, HECS, in every budget since the scheme's introduction in 1989. In every budget the previous Labor government attempted to change and find savings in HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of these measures sought to increase the cost of study to those who had already commenced a course of study. The previous government sought to increase the cost of HECS to those people who were on their way <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through their courses. In recent years the previous government increased HECS for postgraduate studies. They removed that exemption. So the previous Labor government's record on higher education is certainly not as clean and as white as they would make it out to be in this debate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While total operating grant funding has grown with increased student numbers, total operating grant funding per student or the equivalent full-time student units in real terms declined over the previous government's 13-year term. From 1983 to 1996 per capita operating grants declined by 5.5 per cent in real terms. From 1990 to 1996 they remained almost stationary, decreasing by 0.6 per cent. So the previous government's record, as far as higher education is concerned, is very questionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government's funding as a proportion of total university funding has dropped from 90 per cent in 1981 to about 55 per cent&mdash;just bear that in mind. In 1981, 90 per cent of total university funding was from the government. This year it is about 55 per cent. So under Labor real grant funding per student has fallen by seven per cent since 1983. Over the 13 years of Labor government, real grant funding per student fell by seven per cent. Under Labor there has been a 33 per cent increase in the student-staff ratio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the opposition spokesman on higher education has a hide coming in here and raising this matter of public importance about what he perceives to be the government's planned cuts. What would the shadow minister know? He would not know much more than all the media in the gallery know. They have been reporting this issue&mdash;predominantly in one newspaper. A journalist rang me after I represented the minister at the opening of that campus last week. I pointed out to the journalist concerned that it was interesting that it was one particular newspaper that was propagating all the stories about the alleged cuts to the higher education system that have not materialised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, the government is about finding a new and better way of delivering higher education in the 1990s and into the next century&mdash;not going back to the old <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1097"> system. The Labor Party continually looks back at the way it used to be and wants to lock it into the system and permanently keep all these institutions on the government drip. We have to find ways of better delivering the services. There are ways. Vice-chancellors privately acknowledge there is a better way of doing things and they will go in search of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to acknowledge that there is a better way of utilising the enormous capital funding that has been injected into infrastructure in higher education in Australia. In some instances an institution might be closed or not fully utilised for six or seven months of the year. There must be better utilisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government was very long on rhetoric about being much more competitive and about the cost savings that the former Prime Minister used to crow about finding. He did not do it in higher education. There are ways and means of providing a much better higher education system in Australia by utilising the very expensive established infrastructure in that area without upsetting the services and education that is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I close, I point out that it is not this government's review of all departments to try to fill the black hole that is upsetting higher education in New South Wales. That is due to the New South Wales Labor government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>As part of its election commitments, the government stated that it would adopt a user&hyphen;pays approach to the funding of the government's contribution to the International Telecommunication Union, ITU. This bill will assist the government in doing this. Carrier licence fees are payable on 1 July 1996. The government is unable to meet its election commitments without this amendment to the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Act 1991, because the full telecommunications carriers' share of the ITU contribution would exceed the amount which the act currently provides may be collected from the telecommunications carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ITU is a United Nations specialised agency which is concerned with international cooperation in the use of telecommunications and of radiofrequency spectrum, including establishment of standards, and in the development of world telecommunications. Three ITU sectors carry out these functions; namely, the telecommunication standardisation, radiocommunication and development sectors. The government pays an annual financial contribution to the International Telecommunication Union&mdash;$5.8 million for the 1996 calendar year&mdash;that covers the work of all three sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the major beneficiaries from Australia's involvement in the ITU are the telecommunications carrier and radiocommunication licensees, it is appropriate to recover the full cost of the ITU contribution from those licensees. This bill will enable this to be done, through allowing an increase in telecommunications carrier licence fees to include full recovery of the telecommunications carriers' share of the government's contribution to the ITU. The method used to calculate the share will be specified in the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Regulations. The government will be acting separately to ensure that radiocommunication licensees also meet their full share of the ITU contribution.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial impact</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Currently, telecommunications carrier licence fees include a component to cover the ITU contribution of about $1.2 million in 1995&hyphen;96&mdash;the amount varies each year according to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> factors including the level of the government's contribution, the International Telecommunication Union's budget and exchange rate movements. The financial impact of the proposed amendment on carriers will be to increase the annual amount payable in licence fees by about $0.9 million in 1996&hyphen;97. The cost will be shared by carriers on the basis of their share of telecommunications traffic. I have pleasure in commending the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill proposes amendments to veterans' affairs legislation designed to safeguard the interests of veterans and their families and to minimise the action needed to grant certain claims for pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of the proposed amendments is to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 and ties in with the start of the uniform Consumer Credit Code which all states and territories are to implement later in the year. This code will apply to credit provided wholly or chiefly for personal, domestic or household purposes by banks and certain other lenders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the code comes into force, people eligible for housing assistance under the defence service homes scheme will gain consumer rights comparable to those of other borrowers. The amendments in this bill will ensure that they also retain the scheme's benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Westpac Banking Corporation provides subsidised defence service home loans to veterans and other eligible people under an agreement with the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1099">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill identifies elements of the code that Westpac should not apply to loans provided under the scheme so as to preserve the scheme's benefits. For example, a veteran's age may affect the chance of obtaining a loan elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the scheme's agreement, the bank cannot take this into account when deciding whether to provide the veteran with a defence service home loan. The concurrent operation of the Consumer Credit Code will not be limited except for matters set out in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One important aspect of the Consumer Credit Code addressed by the bill is the payment of the loan interest subsidy to Westpac. The Commonwealth now pays this subsidy in advance. In adopting the approach of the Consumer Credit Code, the calculation of interest charged on loans will be linked to unpaid daily balances instead of unpaid monthly balances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new method of calculating interest will be more favourable to borrowers who repay on or before the due dates. It will result in the Commonwealth paying the subsidy to Westpac in arrears. This changeover will result in a one&hyphen;off saving of over $4 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second of the proposed measures is an amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. It will mean that a dependant of a veteran who has died from a disability already accepted as being war caused will be eligible for a pension without the relationship between the veteran's death and war service having to be re&hyphen;established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important change and is consistent with the coalition's undertaking before the election to make the system for claiming pensions as simple as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any claim for pension for a dependant made since 1 June 1994 is determined according to statements of principles, prepared by the Repatriation Medical Authority, for the kind of death met by the veteran. In many cases this will require additional investigation into the background of the fatal disability to enable the criteria in the statements of principles to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This retracing of the war service link is time consuming and often quite complicated, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> even where the disability had previously been related to the veteran's war service. Sometimes, the war service relationship cannot be re&hyphen;established. This could happen because advances in disease research have changed our understanding of the causes of the disability. It could also occur because of changes in legislation made since the disability was determined to be war related. As a result, a veteran's death from a war disability is now no guarantee that his or her dependants will have access to repatriation benefits. This uncertainty is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will do away with these uncertainties, and also the time consuming investigation process. The change will reassure veterans and their families that financial support will continue to be available should the veteran die from a previously accepted war&hyphen;caused disability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, Mr Speaker, this is a bill that will preserve the interests of veterans and their families and streamline access to certain benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA>This bill is a technical corollary to the new Customs Tariff Act 1995 which passed the parliament in the 1995 spring sittings with bipartisan support.The Customs Tariff Act 1995, which will commence on 1 July 1996, implements over 500 tariff classification changes to the harmonised commodity description and coding system of the World Customs Organisation. The passage of the Act <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1100"> last year provided an effective six months lead time before its commencement and was necessary to enable the importing community to make the necessary computer and documentary changes resulting from the new Tariff Act. It has also enabled the checking and revalidation of 120,000 tariff advices on the tariff classification of goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current Customs Tariff Act 1987 will be repealed by Part 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 with effect from 1 July 1996. There are several Commonwealth Acts which presently contain references to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and its provisions. It is necessary to legislatively update all these references with references to the 1995 Tariff Act and its corresponding provisions, to ensure their continued effectiveness (Schedule 1 of this bill refers).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also several types of instruments, such as by-laws and Tariff Concession Orders, which contain references to the provisions of the Customs Tariff Act 1987. These instruments include approximately: 22,000 Tariff Concession Orders and Commercial Tariff Concession Orders; 800 Tariff Concession Order applications; 1,000 Determinations in relation to the Passenger Motor Vehicle Plan; and 300 by-laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As these instruments are intended to continue in effect for the purposes of the new Tariff Act, it is necessary in this bill to enact transitional provisions to apply to these instruments. The provisions, in effect, deem references which are contained in the instruments to the 1987 Tariff Act as if they were references to the 1995 Tariff Act. Where the tariff headings have changed, the provisions deem the references to be to those changed headings as set out in a partial concordance (Schedule 2, items 2 to 5 of this bill refer). In the absence of such a provision, all these instruments will lapse on the commencement of the new 1995 Tariff Act on 1 July 1996 because the 1987 Tariff Act to which they refer is repealed with effect from that date.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 1, schedule 6, omit the item.</PARA>
<PARA>I do so because it seems to me that Wool International Holdings is a totally unnecessary entity. It is in my view an abuse of woolgrowers' hard earned money. What this schedule proposes to do is something which is already available to woolgrowers. Furthermore, if Wool International is seeking to spend money in this way, it should be recognised that $24 million is a lot less than the capitalisation of some companies. They should be required to put out a prospectus seeking support for it in the market. If that support is forthcoming, they should comply with all the terms of the Companies and Securities Commission, and not act with this de facto stealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out that the bill is in many ways unworkable because it talks about Wool International Holdings operating at arm's length. Even if it were to operate at arm's length&mdash;and it is almost certain it would not&mdash;the truth is nobody out there in the industry would believe it was, and that lack of faith would be very detrimental to the wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing Wool International have that effect on the present price of wool. They are selling wool in a declining market. If that wool were sold through the auction system without a reserve price, you would not have the same degree of uncertainty. But the way they are operating at the moment means that no&hyphen;one can or should trust Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem to me that deleting item 1, section 9&mdash;which is covered by paragraphs 33 and 34 in the explanatory memorandum&mdash;would overcome this problem with Wool International Holdings. The rest of the bill could then go forward and play a very useful part in stabilising the primary industries sector.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really absurd for Wool International Holdings to seek, as they are, to use woolgrowers' money to set up and study new methods of marketing wool. They have not put anything forward that we are aware of that has not already been available to woolgrowers. If there is an advantage, they should have made that very clear to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that they said that if they lost all the money, they wouldn't be seeking any more. After losing $24 million of woolgrowers' money, I could understand why they would not be seeking any more. One member of the Wool Council also said, with a rather cavalier attitude, `If all the money was lost, it would amount to only an average of $1,300 per grower.' I find that totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe in futures. After all, it was the wool industry that started the futures market. It is a useful tool for growers. Where it is used for insurance, I think it is useful. Where it is used for speculation, it becomes a very unreliable casino. But it is an option that is available to growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a meeting in Esperance attended by the local branch of the Western Australian Farmers Federation and the Pastoralists and Graziers Association, a representative from the Wool Council was touting the scheme. When asked a question by me about where he thought they would be pitching their sales further down the production chain, he said, `At the level of wool scouring.' That indicated how little that fellow out there cutting the skin actually understood about the industry, and that is one of the dangers we face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem to me that the industry would be much better served if Wool International was phased out altogether. Setting up Wool International Holdings seems to me to smack of the Miller philosophy, Miller being the secretary of John Kerin's former department. His view was that we ought to ultimately have a single acquisition desk. To him, a single buyer would have been absolutely dynamite, but that would spell the end of the wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wool industry is in very dire straits at the moment, and more of this incompetent tampering will be disastrous. I am rather <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1102"> alarmed that the present government has adopted this ill-conceived part of the bill that was developed under the then minister, Senator Bob Collins.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the second reading speech the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) referred to the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill as giving effect to the government's pre-election commitments to repeal the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995 and the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill, which we are now debating, is not driven in any sense by the government's desire to fulfil an election promise. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1103"> Indeed, given the fact that this government has already broken so many of its election promises, it is a cruel irony that it has chosen to fulfil this one&mdash;especially given its disastrous consequences. Neither is this bill driven by any real desire of the government or the minister to establish a viable long-term restructuring of the Australian shipping industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this bill is driven by spite and vindictiveness of a degree unparalleled by any government in recent times. Of course, the minister and the government's rabid dislike of the Maritime Union and the government's inane rantings on this topic are well known to us all. But perhaps less well known is the minister's view on the shipping companies themselves. In response to the second reading of the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Bill on 18 October 1995, the current minister for transport had to this to say about shipping companies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You watch over the next three years, as coastal traders start to rearrange their schedules to ensure that they are eligible for the grant as well. I will bet my bottom dollar on the fact that those people in the coastal trades will see an opportunity to get some money for themselves out of this scheme; they will make rearrangements to their schedules, and they will have their snouts in the trough by getting into this grant system as well.</PARA>
<PARA>This churlish and rather ill-founded attack, at best, may support the contention that the minister treats all those involved in his portfolio with equal disdain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: we are not debating this bill because the government in any sense of the word believes that it is the foundation of a policy which will build on the effective reforms already established in the restructuring of the shipping industry by the former government. Rather, we are debating it due to the indecent haste with which the minister and this government wish to vent their collective spleen on the Maritime Union of Australia and other Australian seafarers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message contained in the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill will undoubtedly undermine the viability of the Australian shipping industry. As BHP Transport put it in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its April 1996 edition of its magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BHPT Ironships</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BHPT does have concerns that the government's stated policies do not necessarily support the attainment of a vibrant Australian shipping industry. As an example, its stated intentions to remove the capital grants and the PAYE grants would have a dramatic effect on the ability of the Australian&hyphen;flagged fleet to compete internationally.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The inclusion of fiscal measures such as these are important in ensuring Australian vessels share a competitive base similar to those of international vessels against which they compete. As I, and other speakers and industry, have already pointed out, this bill will have a wide range of detrimental effects. Australian crews are highly trained. This legislation will result in the use of poorer quality foreign crews and older, less well maintained vessels. This will significantly increase insurance costs paid by users, particularly given that Australian vessels undertake longer voyages, often in very severe conditions. Needless to say, the risk of environmental damage will also be increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year we had a very serious accident at Port Adelaide involving a Saudi Arabian flagged livestock carrier. A subsequent report into the incident conducted by the Department of Transport's Marine Incident Investigation Unit concluded that a lack of knowledge, inexperience and the poor condition of equipment all contributed to the accident. The investigation further found that the crew lacked knowledge and experience in operating a steam plant and had panicked when the incident, which involved a fire in a boiler on board the vessel, occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ship did not have a telephone which the crew could use to notify the Port of Adelaide authorities and to alert emergency services of the problems on board the ship. The World Bank's maritime section has warned that the shipping industry faces an unprecedented crisis as the international shipping fleet becomes a critically ageing fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Maritime Safety Authority reported earlier this month that there were a record number of ships impounded last year for failing to meet basic seaworthiness standards. In 1995, the authority detained 244 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1104"> vessels. In the previous year 153 vessels were detained and in 1993 some 72 vessel were detained. The increase is a direct indicator that risks and falling standards go hand in hand with an ageing fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also of serious concern is the fact that last year the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure was presented with evidence of some of the horrific practices which are becoming all too common amongst crews on foreign ships. Some of those horrific practices reported to the House of Representatives transport committee emanated from vessels under the flag of Third World countries, notably the Philippines and Indonesia, where crews are grossly underpaid, sexually assaulted and physically abused and there were even several cases of bashings and murders. These ships of shame will be the same beneficiaries of the destruction of the Australian shipping industry that this piece of legislation will foster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when the government and economic analysts are calling for measures to deal with the level of Australia's foreign debt, the decimation of the industry will have a negative effect on the net services component of the current account. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics estimated that the current account deficit for 1986&hyphen;87 would have been increased by $440 million if not for our own merchant fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The demise of the national merchant fleet would also impact on our defence capacity. Several shipowners have entered into a memorandum of understanding with the navy to provide assistance in case of a national emergency. Some even have facilities on their ships to specifically assist the navy. The lack of Australian trained seafarers may also make emergency crewing of the navy much more difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I would also like to point out that, from an environmental perspective, sea transport is more desirable than modes of land transport. Bulk shipping uses only 0.2 megajoules of energy per tonne per kilometre compared with 0.4 for government rail and 1.4 for articulated trucks. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, bulk sea transport generates 13 grams of car bon dioxide per tonne per kilometre compared with 29 grams for government rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decline in the maritime industry, which this bill will initiate, will also have spin-off effects in other areas, including marine insurance, towage and pilotage, development and supply of shipping technology, and ship management and repair and maintenance. Australia will also lose vital information on the state of its international shipping markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this legislation, our port and other maritime regulatory authorities will have a greatly reduced pool of skilled labour from which to draw. This will affect not only the provision of harbourmasters and ship control officers, but also safety investigation and emergency personnel in state departments and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only some six months ago, in December of last year, that the Chief Executive of the Australian Maritime College, Captain Rod Short, set out the great potential for the Australian maritime industry presented by the looming shortage of trained personnel around the world to operate both on ships and at ports. Captain Short spoke of a world shortage of at least 400,000 well trained maritime officers in the near future. Australia is well placed to more than double its training capacity, thus seizing a slice of this new growth industry and ensuring valuable foreign income, as well as staking our place as a senior player in the international maritime industry. The potential new market must be put at risk by the government's running down of the Australian shipping industry, which will result from this harmful and misguided piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The early&mdash;and, in essence, retrospective&mdash;withdrawal of the capital grant will have a number of effects which specifically include the fact that Australian shipowners will have less incentive to invest in new ships and technology. As a result, the fleet will age, leading to increased costs which must ultimately be passed to other users. Further increases in capital productivity, and hence decreasing manning levels, will be curtailed as the cost of new vessels becomes a disincentive to further investment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1105">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are at least three vessels currently under construction that were to be delivered in the 1996&hyphen;97 fiscal year. This bill will see a direct, unplanned increase of millions of dollars in the cost of these vessels due to changes in the capital grants program contained in this legislation. Shell, for example, has a 40,000&hyphen;tonne deadweight mixed petroleum product tanker under construction in Poland for delivery in March next year. This ship was specifically planned and budgeted to fit in with the current legislation and will cost $US44 million. It will operate out of Geelong to other Australian ports, although the financial viability of the products and the project have now been affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mackay Refined Sugars has a replacement for its ship, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Innovator</EMPHASIS>, which is currently under construction and which, when finished, will be the world's first purpose&hyphen;built refined sugar carrier. BHPT has the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Yandi</EMPHASIS> under construction in Korea and expects to take delivery of it in December this year. This is a 170,000&hyphen;tonne bulk carrier. Again, the investment timing and decision behind the building of this ship was predicated on the continued existence of the capital grant which this legislation seeks to withdraw.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 17 May reports the Executive Director of the Australian Shipowners Association, Mr Lachlan Payne, as saying that further planned investments in new shipping worth $250 million would be shelved as a result of this retrograde legislation, particularly the abolition of the capital grants and accelerated depreciation scheme for new ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Repealing the grant paid to international trading vessels will have a number of effects, including to provide an incentive for Australian vessels to switch their operations from international to coastal operations, therefore placing further pressure on the current account deficit. This will occur as a result of increasing the cost of international trades relative to coastal ones. There are a number of examples of companies that, as a result of this grant, have reorganised their fleet schedules to increase their export earnings. Australian shipowners will be placed at a competitive disadvantage in relation to ships registered in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other countries where there are generous tax concessions and, specifically, where ships are registered in tax havens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most countries, be they OECD or otherwise, provide fiscal assistance to their national fleets. This assistance may include depreciation allowances, concessional tax rates, or concessional loans and subsidies. As such, the abolition of the current assistance program will not create a level playing field for Australian shipping in the international market but will place the industry at a distinct competitive disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian shipowners and workers alike have made significant gains in productivity and competitiveness in the last decade. Since 1989, over $2 billion has been committed to investment in ships, with the result that the Australian fleet is half the age of the world fleet. Manning levels on Australian international ships have fallen from an average of 31.6 seafarers in 1986 to 18.4 seafarers in 1995, which the minister, in his second reading speech, concedes is now consistent with international standards. He also intimated that industrial disputes had hit their lowest level in a decade in 1992&hyphen;93 when only 23 ship days were lost due to crew disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfair and unjust to attack an industry that is making such progress halfway through its restructuring process merely to satisfy the government's disdain of the Maritime Union and, perhaps to a lesser degree, the shipping companies. It would serve as an omen for things to come. The previous Labor government had a fine record in the development and implementation of sector specific industry policy, and the current government and minister for transport could learn much from this example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether working with the Button plan for the reform of our automotive industry, which saw exports quadruple from $400 million in 1984 to over $1.5 billion in 1994, with an expected $2 billion figure being reached by the year 2000, working with companies in the pharmaceutical industry such as Glaxo and Faulding, or working with the phasing out of tariffs in the textile, clothing and footwear industries, the great success in each of these industry specific sectoral examples was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1106"> predicated on the extensive and inclusive consultative processes which involved all players&mdash;whether they be employers, union or government&mdash;working together in pursuit of the best outcomes for all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following on from the fine work done by the former Minister for Transport, the Hon. Ralph Hunt, in commissioning Sir John Crawford to begin a process of encouraging the key players in Australia's shipping industry to come together to consider the future development of the industry, the Labor government set up the Maritime Industry Development Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An industry development package was subsequently crafted from this process which was based along three fundamental tenets: the first was that the unions involved accepted that changes to work practices were necessary to improve efficiency; secondly, ship operators would invest, where commercially feasible, in high technology to facilitate new crewing arrangements; and, thirdly, the government would provide financial incentives to facilitate the process of reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was this approach by the previous Labor government which achieved real results in Australia's shipping industry. Yet, by contrast, the coalition government's approach is piecemeal and antagonistic. As Mr Lance Hockridge from BHP Transport has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Removing this assistance without at the same time bringing in ways for the industry to reduce costs by at least the same amount creates a hiatus where we cannot provide competitive shipping service.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I believe there is nothing wrong with subsidies. Indeed, the egalitarian nature of Australian society is underpinned by subsidies throughout its economic structure. What I do have a significant problem with is the sheer ignorance demonstrated by those on the other side. Some claimed earlier that they know the maritime industry because seafarers come into their pub once in a while or they know the maritime industry because they worked for a short time on a ship 10 years ago. That is the sort of thing that I do have a problem with. An act of this significance cannot be premised and founded on such ignorance. It is on that basis that I sincerely hope that the government's approach to the Australian shipping <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry is not a forerunner of their broader industry policy. Australian industry and our country as a whole cannot afford it. To that end, I urge honourable members to oppose this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the previous speaker, the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), I would like to express a number of concerns about the measures which the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has brought before the parliament. I want to begin by saying that from our perspective it appears that there is no rational basis for the government's bringing forward of these measures. We can have no conclusion other than that this minister is driven by an ideological obsession with the Maritime Union of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has had many opportunities when in opposition to attack the MUA and look at ways he could try to undermine the previous government's attempts to improve efficiency on the waterfront and amongst Australian flag and crewed ships. The Howard government now having been elected, this minister is attempting to set out on a strategy that will have a number of very deleterious effects for the Australian economy as a whole and for many people who are concerned about the future of the Australian shipping industry. I would like to make a few comparisons between the quite modest protection provided to the Australian maritime industry and the protection provided to other industries in the Australian economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister interjects sarcastically, implying that the assistance provided to the maritime industry is not modest. I can certainly say that if you compare it with the assistance given to the car industry or for textile production it is modest. Why do we on this side of the House think it is important to have a deliberate industry policy that encourages investment in motor vehicle manufacture, in parts production and exports, and in textile production? The answer is that we think they are an essential part of the Australian economy and that a lot of jobs and investment can flow and a lot of export dollars can be earned for Australia by having viable motor vehicle <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1107"> and textile production industries. That is why we have a special tariff protection scheme for those two industries. We have a special tax concession to encourage people to invest in research and development&mdash;150 per cent tax deduction for investment in R&amp;D. We think it is good for the economy to encourage investment in scientific research and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government tried to encourage investment in lots of information technology industries, a policy I hope this government continues. The great irony for us, throughout this whole debate, is to see National Party member follow Liberal Party member. They represent rural electorates and on many previous occasions have been in this chamber arguing for special assistance for rural industries because, they argue, they are important for the Australian economy. Naturally, being the reasonable people we are, on occasions we are convinced that various important sections of the rural industry do need special assistance at certain times of international cycles and demand for commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that the maritime industry is at least as important as the car industry, the textile industry or the agricultural industry and as important as the encouraging of investment in research and development. For all those reasons we argue quite strongly that the measures the government has introduced into the House will undermine for all time one of our most crucial service industries. It is going to be a backward step if implemented by the government. If it can persuade the parliament to agree to these measures that will be regretted for decades to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some way the minister has tried to suggest that the capital grants provided to companies that invest in new ships is, in some way, special assistance to the Australian maritime industry. The Labor Party has argued throughout this debate that many OECD countries provide these capital grants. Even your conservative brothers and sisters in the United Kingdom provide grants to British shipowners when they go out and invest in new shipping.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been very important for the Australian maritime industry that we have tried to encourage investment in new plant and equipment and in new ships and that we have tried to ensure that we move towards having the most efficient ships possible. That could only be achieved by encouraging the updating and modernising of our fleet. That went hand in hand with the reduction in the average number of seafarers on our ships. The number has fallen from an average of 31.6 in 1986 to only 18.4 in 1995 as a result of an investment of over $2 billion which has been committed to investment in new ships. As a result, we have an Australian fleet that is half the age of the world fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having that government industry policy has been good for Australia. It has encouraged investment in new ships. I have to say that the impression the minister for transport tries to encourage, that we have an inefficient shipping fleet, is just not true. Our manning levels have improved dramatically, particularly when you look at the LNG vessels carrying our LNG to markets in Japan. The Australian ship that is owned and staffed by Australian seafarers is able to provide a much lower cost structure than that provided by Japanese seafarers&mdash;no offence to our Japanese customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a clear demonstration of the fact that in Australia in the 13 years of Labor government we were prepared to implement reforms that allowed the Australian maritime industry to become more efficient. The fact that the minister for transport gives no credit to the sacrifices that have been made by people involved in the Australian maritime industry does him little credit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1108"> I say to the seafarers living in my electorate who have had to undertake new training and to change the way they work when they are on vessels at sea that it is to their great credit that they have been prepared to work, often in cooperation with employers, to help develop a competitive industry and to make these sacrifices over the last 13 years. But I bet that when this minister for transport sets out on an ideologically driven campaign to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia there will be no further reason for cooperation between sea farers and employers and no further reason for cooperation between seafarers and the Howard government. I am very concerned that it is going to result in stoppages and in disruption to Australia's exports in future years, because of this ideological obsession that this government and this minister have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a tremendous amount of confusion in the wider community about the former government's proposal to provide employers&mdash;shipowners&mdash;with a taxable grant equal to the PAYE tax, which would otherwise be paid by seafarers. The Liberal and National parties try to create the impression that in some way the seamen are no longer paying PAYE tax. They try to create the impression that in some way the seafarers are getting some tax concession, because of discussions that took place in the last parliament between the ACTU, the government and shipping owners. Every member of this House should understand that the grant was payable to the shipping owners, not to the seamen. The grant was payable to allow the shipowners to have a lower cost structure to allow them to be more competitive with other ships that are competing on the routes to and from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it is important that Australia does not have a massive deficit in services. We know that through the massive growth in the tourism industry in the last 13 years, and I hope it continues to grow, Australia has a services surplus. If this government and this minister seek to undermine the efficiency of the Australian maritime industry, we will no longer have all of those Australian flag and Australian manned ships generating export dollars for Australia. What will happen is that those ships will be replaced ship by ship by vessels that have foreign flags and by vessels that have foreign seamen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us know that there have been a number of reports by committees of this parliament that have expressed great concern about the ships of shame and about the levels of safety that exist in some ships that have foreign flags. Despite the intensified efforts of people who are concerned about the safety of those ships, you can never ensure that foreign flag ships are as safe as Australian flag ships. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> You can never ensure that the seafarers who are working on those ships have the same very high standards of training that the Australian seamen have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of those reasons, we can quite rightly be greatly concerned about the environmental threat that will be posed by more foreign flag ships plying their way around the Australian coastline in future years as a result of measures this government has introduced. For all of those reasons, those of us on this side of the House will strongly oppose these measures. The minister at the table, through this ideological obsession he has of trying to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia, is embarking on a path that will do Australia great damage in future years. He will have to answer to this parliament in future days about the damage he causes to industrial relations in this industry and in many others.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those members from both sides of the House who participated in the debate. It is obvious that I enjoyed listening to some sectors of the debate more than I did to others, but it has been an interesting debate. It has been interesting to see how members on the Labor side are trying to reinstate their trade union roots and their trade union credentials. The speech by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), was interesting. I have never heard him speak on maritime matters before in the parliament. There is nothing like having a marginal seat to focus your mind on some of these things, and I am sure we will hear more from him in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to hear him make a number of claims, of which he needs to be reminded are not necessarily correct. For example, he claimed that we have improved our Australian shipping industry dramatically over the last few years and that we have a world competitive fleet. It is worth pointing out to him that the Bureau of Transport and Communication Economics points out that the cost of operating an Australian flag vessel, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars that the former government poured down the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1109"> throat of the maritime industry, is around $2 million over and above that of industry averages around the world each year&mdash;$2 million per ship per year in excess of industry averages around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also made the very interesting point that the maritime industry deserves its protection, because it is as important as the textiles, clothing and footwear industry, the motor vehicle building industry and the farming industries. Let me point out that the previous Labor government did away with all levels of support or protection, if you like, for the farming industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the last 13 years of Labor government, it did away with a great deal of the protection for the textiles, clothing and footwear industry&mdash;much of which is in your electorate. It did away with a great deal of the protection that industry enjoyed. Indeed, it has been winding down towards zero those protection levels over a number of years. The same has been the case with the motor vehicle building industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the previous speaker was making the claim that the maritime industry deserves all of its protection, because it is just like the motor vehicle building industry, or the TCF industry or the farming industry. Indeed, if that were the case, then the maritime industry's protection ought to be wound down, as was the case with those industries that the previous speaker highlighted in his examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing the previous speaker alluded to&mdash;and this has been a common theme amongst a number of Labor speakers in this debate&mdash;was that this is going to see the end of the level of cooperation between seafarers and their employers and seafarers and the government. If their level of cooperation is anything to praise, then one has to look only at the levels of industrial disputations that occurred during the last 12 or 18 months of the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had an extraordinary increase in the number of strikes from the Maritime Union of Australia. Indeed, the strike club, an international organisation of shipowners around the world, does an annual assessment of strikes that affect their industry. Australia went from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accounting for around 11 per cent of all maritime stoppages around the world a couple of years ago to accounting for 25 per cent. The threat is that things are going to get worse. How could they get much worse than what we experienced in the previous 12 to 18 months of the Labor government? The level of industrial disputation in the maritime industry increased dramatically and was caused in many cases by disputes that did not occur in the maritime industry&mdash;for example, the Weipa dispute. The maritime unions decided to go on strike over the Weipa dispute. It had nothing to do with them, but they felt that this was a good opportunity to go on strike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have these sorts of threats of an end to what has been described as a cooperative relationship between seafarers and their employers and seafarers and the government. I think the people concerned do not realise that this is something which ended a long time ago. That is why we have had such a large increase in industrial disputation on the Australian waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the previous speaker say that the maritime industry has received modest levels of support from the government of old. Let us just look at this. From 1989 through to today&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because your Prime Minister never tabled yours, did he? We are certainly not following any practices that are any less than what you had in office, my friend. If you people think that those things are so import <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1110"> ant, why didn't you do them when you were in government?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me talk about modest levels of support. Three hundred and twenty million dollars from the taxpayer was allocated to the shipping industry between 1989 and the present day. In addition, some $450 million was allocated to the stevedoring sector of the maritime industry between 1989 and 1992. If we then take into account the cost of appeasing the Maritime Union of Australia over its concerns about the privatisation of ANL, which the former government tried to sell in 1991, we would have to recognise there has been an additional cost of some $150 million in losses incurred by ANL as a consequence of the delayed sale of that government enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we add all those together&mdash;$150 million for ANL, $320 million for the shipping industry and $450 million for the stevedoring sector of the maritime industry&mdash;we find that the former government has given nearly a billion dollars worth of direct financial assistance to the maritime sector since 1989. Do the taxpayers of Australia believe a billion dollars worth of assistance to be modest? Do they believe the investment this country has made in the maritime sector to the tune of a billion dollars has delivered a dividend? Has it given us a shipping industry that is internationally competitive? Has it given us a maritime sector that is industrially reliable? The answer to that is no, we still do not have a shipping industry in Australia that is internationally competitive and we still do not have a maritime industry in Australia that is industrially reliable. All that money was spent because it was claimed we would achieve these goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members will recall that, as part of the PAYE tax arrangements for seafarers, a deal was struck in September 1994 as a consequence of a strike over the sale of ANL. The former government struck a deal saying that it would pay the PAYE tax for seafarers on the basis that it got a number of reforms from that industry which would be equal in value to the amount of money&mdash;some $19 million to $20 million&mdash;that it was to allocate to the PAYE scheme each year. The maritime <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> union said, `We'll do that. We'll provide you with those sorts of benefits.' What happened? We did not get any of those benefits from the Maritime Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the deal was that the crew&hyphen;to&hyphen;berth ratio was supposed to come down. What happened? The crew&hyphen;to&hyphen;berth ratio went up. The crew&hyphen;to&hyphen;berth ratio in Australia is two to 13. What is the international average? It is one to seven. Again, what is happening in Australia, where enormous amounts of money were paid out by the previous government allegedly to make Australia internationally competitive? We have gone the other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think many people in this country would quite legitimately raise the question: why did the former government pay out all this money to this sector? The answer to that is because they were dominated, influenced and, in many cases, controlled by unions like the Maritime Union of Australia. We only have to hear the sorts of speeches that were given by Jennie George and Bill Kelty last Friday in Sydney to realise just how much influence the Maritime Union of Australia has over the labour movement and the Labor government of old. That is how they got their billion dollars over that period, and that is why they were able to get it without giving Australia an efficient maritime industry. So all that money has gone down the drain for no particular gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the claims by the opposition that the early termination of the Ships (Capital Grants) Act is retrospective legislation. That is simply nonsense. The three shipowners would not have accrued any entitlement until the ships were delivered and registered in Australia. In other words, they would not have been eligible for that subsidy or that grant until the ships were registered here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite may talk about retrospective legislation, but when we were in opposition we made it quite clear to the industry on many occasions over a long period&mdash;I recall making a speech back in 1989, when I first became the shadow minister for land transport and shipping, in parliament indicating this&mdash;that the opposition, as the coalition was in those days, was opposed to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act. Indeed, we had in our policy in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1111"> 1990 the fact that we would end the Ships (Capital Grants) Act. We also said in our 1993 policy that we would end it. We said in our 1996 policy for the election just a few months ago that we would end it. We took particular pain to inform the industry that this was our policy position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in opposition, my senior staff member flew to Melbourne to brief the director of the Australian Shipowners Association, Mr Lachlan Payne, about what our policies were for the forthcoming election. He did that last year, and he made it quite clear what they were. Indeed, in many speeches that I gave over the years at shipping conferences, I reiterated our commitment in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody in the Australian shipping industry can rightfully complain that this was a bolt out of the blue&mdash;it was never a bolt out of the blue. It was clearly laid out in our 1990 policy, the 1993 policy and the 1996 policy. It was also laid out in many speeches here in the parliament, at industry conferences around the countryside, and on occasions to specially brief executive members of the Australian Shipowners Association and, indeed, senior members of the industry. So nobody can claim that this was a bolt out of the blue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shipowners made their investment in the knowledge of the coalition's strong opposition to the grants being extended beyond 1989. In discussions with the Australian Shipowners Association they were well and truly informed of our position. All industries face the prospect of regulatory changes from time to time, just as they must face changes in the commercial environment. Prudent businesses&mdash;and I am sure the three companies that are involved in this issue are prudent businesses&mdash;will always factor in contingencies when looking at new investments, especially long&hyphen;term investments like ships with an operating life of at least 16 years, and up to 25 years in the case of Shell's oil tanker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The shipowners will still benefit from the accelerated depreciation provision. This benefit is worth more than twice as much as the taxable grant to a tax paying company. The benefit writes down a ship for tax pur poses over five years, commencing in the pre&hyphen;commissioning year. Effectively, that is a four&hyphen;year depreciation for a ship with a life of from 16 to 25 years, and that is worth considerably more than the grants were worth. Indeed, that continues for those three ships that are of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that the ships capital grant and the Crawford scheme before it had served their purpose by 1992, when the grants scheme was originally scheduled to terminate. It was to serve as a catalyst to reduce crews from the mid&hyphen;30s to the late&hyphen;20s, and then the momentum of change would lead to further efficiencies and productivity improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition supported this timetable originally. The coalition supported the development of a strong Australian shipping industry. This government no less supports a strong Australian shipping industry now. All the money poured into the industry by successive Labor governments has not produced a strong industry. It is only three per cent bigger in carrying capacity now than when Labor came to office in 1983 and, indeed, we actually have a lesser number of vessels registered in Australia. In 1983 we had 82 Australian flag registered vessels; today we have 68. Despite all this&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The world is real life; competition is real life. Despite all the money that has been injected into this industry, we now have considerably fewer vessels operating under Australian registration than we had in 1983. That is what 13 years of your government has done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As noted in the shipowners' own report, the trend in OECD countries has been to wind back direct subsides and move to second registers. These countries have realised the futility of pouring in taxpayers' money, trying to sustain national flag fleets. Second registers create the operating environment through which advanced economy countries can compete with flags of convenience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) noted how Norway controls a major share <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1112"> of world shipping despite its small population, which is true. Did it do this by pouring more and more taxpayers' money into the industry? Of course not. It sowed the seeds and pushed the productivity reforms with the cooperation of the maritime unions and created its second register. Norwegian shipping flourishes because it has moved with the times, not because its government has poured unlimited funds into its national flag fleet. In Australia, by contrast, the pace of shipping reform has been abysmal as the unions have dragged their heels at each and every stage while the taxpayers dig deeper and deeper into their pockets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) could not resist picking up the industry furphy about the defence support role. It is a pity he did not check on the facts. No Australian merchant ship is specially fitted out for a defence support capability. Some years ago a stern refuelling trial was carried out, but the project was abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having presided over a ships capital grants scheme that had outlived its usefulness, Labor then saw fit to throw good money after bad with its international ships grants scheme. Labor took on board this scheme in a panic to pacify the Maritime Union of Australia and to settle the September 1994 national shipping strike. No thought was given to getting a proper productivity trade&hyphen;off. Instead, the unions were simply told to work up some sort of industrial package with employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That package&mdash;the maritime industry restructuring agreement&mdash;has been a failure. It has not delivered either the efficiencies or the cost savings promised by the unions. Where are the promised crew&hyphen;to&hyphen;berth ratio reductions? Where is the cooperation to reduce shipboard injuries and to cut compensation rorts? Where is the promised industrial peace accord? That lies buried at Weipa. Can you imagine any greater act of irresponsibility and sheer bastardry than the Maritime Union bashing the shipping industry over a dispute by other workers with CRA? This union, which pleads for the industry to be supported, is happy enough to give it a king hit as and when it pleases.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the unions, employers and opposition are wringing their hands and claiming the industry will be decimated if the international shipping grant is withdrawn. That is complete rubbish. This grant has been a windfall gain, mainly to highly profitable companies like BHP and international oil companies whose ships were already in international trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian shipping industry can become competitive. It can develop to carry a significant portion of Australian trade and it can make a significant contribution to our balance of payments. But this will only happen when the industry wakes up to itself and models itself on successful maritime nations like Norway and other second registered countries which have moved with the times, got rid of restrictive work practices and improved productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government will sit down with the unions and the shipowners to develop the conditions for a strong, viable shipping industry&mdash;not conditions which hinge on endless amounts of taxpayers' money, but conditions which give Australians the opportunity to compete on a level playing field with second register countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding my remarks today on this debate, I think it is very worth while for members to note the fact that, through the 13 years of Labor's administration of this country, Australians heard a great deal of talk about reform of the maritime industry, be it on the waterfront or in the shipping industries. Indeed, whilst there was a lot of talk, there was very little action. To this day we are still not within a bull's roar of having an internationally competitive waterfront. Your crew&hyphen;to&hyphen;berth ratios are way out of line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The costs, according to the BTCE, of operating an Australian registered vessel under the conditions that apply here in Australia are $2 million extra than it ought to be and what would be the cost in comparable ships in other parts of the world&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most substantial part of the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill concerns the repeal of the training guarantee levy, which the opposition does not oppose. There are two other key aspects to the bill. The first seeks to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to correct a minor anomaly to enable expenditure of funds already allocated for open learning. I am pleased to say that the opposition also does not oppose that. The second aspect, which the opposition also does not oppose, goes to an amendment to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 to fulfil the previous government's commitment to spend an extra $20 million on the non&hyphen;government schools capital program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having dealt with the outline of the bill, I think that I should also make the point on behalf of the opposition that the bill is in line with the direction in which the former Labor government was moving. In fact, the proposal with respect to the repeal of the training guarantee levy was integral to the Working Nation statement of 1994. In that context, I refer to the fact that we proposed to suspend the training guarantee scheme for a two&hyphen;year period from July 1994, having introduced the bill in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As members of the House will recall, the training guarantee scheme was created in 1990 for one major purpose. That purpose was to try to help change the training culture within business. The objective was clearly to require a minimum level of training expendi ture, rising to 1.5 per cent of the payroll for companies with a turnover of more than $220,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government of the day then thought that it was an appropriate response to the pressing problem that confronted the nation at the time. I refer specifically to the historical position all too often in Australia&mdash;that when businesses were left to their own devices they failed to invest adequately in the training of their work force. I would also say in passing, as has been borne out by the recent Karpin report, that not only did businesses fail to invest in the nature of work that is traditionally represented by the union movement in Australia, but they also historically failed to invest in management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope that the current government moves to implement some of the major recommendations of the Karpin report with respect to the need of business in Australia to invest to a greater degree in training management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key areas that needs attention, for example, is developing an export culture. In respect of the issue of trying to increase our performance on the trade front, there has been a large degree of agreement between the government of the day and the opposition of the day. I believe it is about time managers also faced up to the fact that they need to invest in their own training and pay adequate attention to ensuring that the management that we train in the future is properly aware of the need to have an export culture and to actually chase export opportunities for the future development of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the training guarantee legislation of 1990 was an appropriate response by the government of the day. There was a pressing problem at the time and very deliberate action was required by the government of the day to force this nation to invest in its greatest resource, its work force, and to ensure that they had adequate skills for the purposes of making Australia competitive and taking the nation forward, both within the nation's boundaries and at an international level in the light of the increasing globalisation of the economy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1115">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would remind the House this evening that the coalition then consistently opposed the government's initiative. They suggested that the government's initiative in introducing the training guarantee legislation was an interference in business operations and that it was, in essence, yet another example of bureaucratic red tape. I believe that from time to time there is a very direct requirement for government to prod business to ensure that they face up to their responsibilities. As a former trade union official, I am well aware of the fact that all too often businesses in this country have failed to adequately invest in the training of their work force. In essence, whilst there are many good employers in Australia, there is a minority of employers who deliberately refuse to invest in the training of their work force and, if anything, act as parasites on other employers in the Australian community. They are not just my words; those words were also echoed by a number of business representatives at the time the training guarantee legislation was introduced in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only have they been parasites by their failure to invest in the training of their work force; quite often it was as a result of their failure to invest in the training of their work force that skill shortages emerged which also led from time to time to outbreaks on the wages front. I refer to the fact that, as a result of their failure to invest in the skilling of the Australian work force, rather than taking on apprentices and trainees they simply went into the market and competed against fellow employers to attract labour, and that in turn very much resulted in a wages outbreak. The real position was that other employers were therefore forced to compete in attracting and retaining labour. But once it occurs with respect to a specific area of employment, be it a particular trade in a given enterprise or a range of trades or semi&hyphen;skilled workers in a given enterprise, it normally results in the wages outbreak across the whole economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue that the endeavours by the previous government under the training guarantee legislation of 1990 were not merely about the skilling of the Australian work force and making the Australian economy more competitive but also about ensuring that we faced up to some of the economic necessities <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the all&hyphen;important issue of wages. On that front, I note in passing that the current government is not interested in wages policy. I also believe that they are not properly interested in placing pressure on the nation at large to ensure that there is an adequate investment in the training of the Australian work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply mark the opposition's position with respect to these issues this evening, as I am exceptionally worried about the fact that the current government does not have an adequate wages policy. The fact is that they are not prepared to sit down and work with the trade union movement, which has clearly proven over the last 13 years that it has a capacity to work with business, deliver improvements in productivity and changes in work practices and, at the same time, dramatically reduce the level of industrial disputation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say something in passing on the level of industrial disputation&mdash;and I know these figures worry the government of the day, especially the former Treasurer in the Fraser&hyphen;Anthony government, now the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). When he was the Treasurer of this great nation, the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees due to industrial disputes was 591 compared with 194 days under the Hawke Labor government. In essence, as a result of having in place a reasonable approach to the important issue of training and a proper focus on best practice, improvements in productivity and changes in work practices, we achieved a dramatic reduction in the level of industrial disputation in Australia of the order of 60 per cent. I wonder whether, in a couple of years time, the government will be able to refer to a similar achievement in the level of industrial disputation as was achieved by the Accord period of operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the training guarantee legislation, I want to make the point that not only did the then opposition seek to misrepresent the true objectives of that legislation throughout the Australian community and especially the business community, but, more importantly, they were bereft of ideas. On no occasion when the bill was debated in the House, or when it was eventually passed by the House, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1116"> did the then opposition advance any ideas as to how to address the run&hyphen;down of Australia's skill base in an unregulated market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anything, it was a little bit like the lead&hyphen;up to the election of 2 March. Again, the then opposition was bereft of ideas. Unlike under their previous coalition leader, Mr Hewson, in the lead&hyphen;up to the 1993 election, they were afraid to advance a comprehensive package of policy ideas and suggestions as to how they would take Australia forward. Instead, they ran away from a policy debate, as they ran away from a policy debate in 1990 on the training guarantee legislation. And, having been elected, they have merely taken out of their hip pocket their Fightback policies aimed at cutting to the bone the endeavours by Australia as a nation to ensure that all in the community are treated with some respect and dignity and that we go out of our way to make sure that,  as a nation, we look after the more disadvantaged in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the fact that, in announcing the decision in 1994 to suspend the levy in Working Nation, the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Crean, noted the increased commitment by industry in meeting its training obligations since the levy had first come in. In that context, I believe that the legislation was successful. It was on that basis that we, as a government, then gave a commitment to abolish the levy altogether if business would make a credible commitment to create an adequate number of new training places. That is what it was about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original legislation of 1990 was about prodding industry to ensure that they invested in the training of the Australian work force, invested in creating skill opportunities and career opportunities for both men and women in industry at large. On that basis, the introduction of the expanded entry level training and the new training wage was pursued by the government as part of a Working Nation package that provided an appropriate context for the suspension of the levy. Then in the lead&hyphen;up to the recent election, in accord with our statements of 1994 when we introduced the Working Nation statement, we gave an outright commitment to abolish the levy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We nevertheless express concern this evening that the associated steps that we put forward in announcing the Working Nation statement of 1994 will be set back somewhat as a result of the change of government on 2 March.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer specifically to the advances made in employment and training in Australia over the last decade and more. The reason the levy can now be removed is its success&mdash;the success of the Labor Party in government in generating increased expenditure by employers on training. The levy itself has been part of the broader success of the Working Nation strategy in bringing unemployment, and particularly long&hyphen;term unemployment, down. It has also been part of a wider revolution in training which the former Labor government brought about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in government we changed the outdated apprenticeship system, moving it towards a competency based system of training rather than purely time based, and making it more flexible to meet the needs of employers. One of our major achievements was the expansion in Australia, for the benefit of people of all ages who wanted to pursue it, of properly constituted competency based training opportunities, not only through individual training with a particular employer but, more importantly, through a group training company. It is interesting to note that one of the big successes on that front was with the ACTU and the Lend Lease company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the length and breadth of Australia in a range of industries&mdash;importantly in the new industries&mdash;there are new opportunities for employment. For example, the service sector, the retail industry and the hospitality industry are creating thousands of opportunities for people in Australia. Access to competency based training will, in turn, guarantee them a lifetime opportunity to pursue a career in a range of new industries in the services sector of Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We sought to ensure not only that training existed in the old blue&hyphen;collar trades oriented industries, but also that it was open and made available to as many workers as possible in the new growth industries in the services sector.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We moved towards national frameworks for training and skills recognition. We <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1117"> did not want separate systems from state to state or from employer to employer. We wanted to make sure that employees who pursued a training course had an opportunity to move from employer to employer, from state to state and from territory to territory and have their skills properly recognised and accredited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of apprenticeships it is interesting to note that we lifted apprenticeship commencements from their low point of around 34,000 under John Howard as Treasurer prior to 1983 to nearly double that level by the late 1980s. I know it upsets the opposition to hear from time to time about that particular achievement because they deliberately seek in this House to misrepresent the figures on apprenticeship enrolments now compared with the past when they had responsibility for training issues in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They fail to understand that the old system has fundamentally changed in character from when they were last in government. They ignore our achievement in bringing about this historic change and they wilfully ignore the huge increase in the number of young people staying on at secondary school over the 12 years of Labor government. I am quite proud of those achievements. When John Howard was last in government the then government failed to face up to the fact that we should properly invest in the education and training of Australians and especially our young.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the early 1980s when John Howard was Treasurer our school retention rates to year 12 were abysmal; in fact, just over 35 per cent of the students stayed on to year 12. Today the figure is well over 70 per cent for students staying to year 12. We should be trying to improve on that figure, if not setting a target. Unfortunately, the current government is somewhat ashamed of setting targets because they do not like benchmarks as to how the community at large can measure their performance. Not only are they not prepared to set a target with respect to school retention rates but, more importantly, they are not prepared to set a target with respect to job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of job creation, I might say in passing that I think the performance of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor government was second to none. Three years ago we set a target of 300,000 jobs. At the end of the three&hyphen;year period 730,000 jobs were achieved. Why is the current government so afraid of setting a target? I and many others know the real answer to that question. It is because they are not vitally concerned with the issue of employment. If they were vitally concerned with the issue of employment they would not be sacking many thousands of public servants at this particular point in time. Unfortunately, the dismissal of those public servants will not affect just the nation's capital of Canberra. More importantly, it will have a major impact on metropolitan Australia and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every loss of a government job in those regional centres will have a multiplier effect in the Australia community. The closure of a taxation office in one of the regional centres or the amalgamation of a CES office with a Department of Social Security office will have a consequent loss of jobs. There is no concern by the government of the day for those people and their families or for the impact on local communities. I suggest that their failure to set an employment target is really related to the fact that, under it all, they are really not concerned about the level of unemployment in Australia; they are merely concerned with looking after their mates at the top end of town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also say that under Labor more funds were injected into vocational training and its status was boosted. We negotiated, for example, a new training wage. In Working Nation we also established the youth training initiative to provide 50,000 opportunities every year for 15&hyphen; to 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds to find a job, training or education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1118"> The former government also promoted international best practice. It is strange when we hear the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) talk about workplace reform. I still have not heard him refer to the issue of best practice. Best practice is also related to training, changes in work practices and a change in culture at a workplace level, but unfortunately the Minister for Industrial Relations thinks that improving Australia's competitive position is merely related to passing a new act in respect of the manage ment of industrial relations in this country. It is not about a new act; it is about people sitting down and talking and facing up to their own responsibilities and working it out, as has occurred over the last 13 years and as is evidenced in the fact that the level of industrial disputation was reduced over that period by something of the order of 60 per cent. It is about the quality and quantity of training, a concern, I might suggest, which is now tending to disappear from the debate in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to Enterprising Nation, or the Karpin report, as it is best known, we also addressed the need to improve manager skills and not just focus on those of workers. That is about a holistic approach to workplace reform, ensuring that all aspects of a particular workplace are involved in the process of change and making individual companies, individual industries and individual states, regions and the nation at large more competitive&mdash;not just focusing on the training and the level of skills of people at the shop floor but also ensuring, through the recommendations of the Karpin report, that we pursue a holistic approach to training and workplace change in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to surveys undertaken since the introduction of the training guarantee scheme. They have shown that employers' training expenditure has jumped dramatically. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, total expenditure on formal training by Australia employers rose by 18 per cent in the three years following the scheme's introduction, and particularly amongst small to medium size employers. Before the training guarantee, nearly 60 per cent of employers with payrolls over $200,000 unfortunately provided no structured training at all. Since the training guarantee, more than 90 per cent of employers over that limit provide structured training equal to at least 1.5 per cent of their payrolls&mdash;again according to data from the Australian Taxation Office. Yet unfortunately one of the first acts of the new government has been to undo much of the good work. They have ceased approval of any new labour market program commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If members of the government have got any question in their minds about that, when they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> return to their electorates they ought to contact the local CES office and the Skillshare office and talk to some of the community organisations that have been involved in the area consultative committees who sought to go out of their way, for example, to create opportunities for the long&hyphen;term unemployed. Yes, they might shake their shoulders and suggest that it is not an important issue, but I think it is an all&hyphen;important issue that we continue to properly fund those initiatives which were aimed at ensuring that we did not create a long&hyphen;term pool of forgotten workers in Australia but that we created opportunities to ensure that all those long&hyphen;term unemployed were given opportunities to undertake training and to again get job ready so that they would be in a position to be taken up by employers and to obtain meaningful and long&hyphen;term employment opportunities again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government have frozen the intake of unemployed people into the jobtrain program. They have abolished NETTFORCE, despite the fact that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, herself said in the Senate that she was pleased with the performance of NETTFORCE. Employers, in association with unions and government representatives, have been going out of their way across all regions of Australia to break down the barriers and to ensure that traineeships were taken up as a primary opportunity to ensure that people get training and employment opportunities around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1119"> The government have stopped the processing of new applications under the special intervention program. They are jeopardising the work of front&hyphen;line agencies such as the Salvation Army and its crossroads job scheme for the disadvantaged and homeless. They are holding up&mdash;and it is interesting that I refer to this, as Aboriginal Reconciliation Week is next week&mdash;the funding for the community development projects, or CDEP, the major employment program for indigenous Australians, and that will have a devastating effect on employment and welfare in Australia's Aboriginal communities. They refuse to give proper long&hyphen;term guarantees for the highly successful work of skillshares. They are leaving hundreds of contract case manage ment trainees in the hospitality industry in the lurch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cuts which the government is making to the Working Nation labour market programs will have a very damaging effect on unemployment levels in Australia. I also suggest that they are a blatant breach of commitments given by the Prime Minister and members of the government during the course of the recent election campaign. The coalition said during the election campaign that it strongly supports the increased efforts to provide active assistance for long&hyphen;term unemployed people in recent years. John Howard, in his Damascus&hyphen;like conversion to Labor policies at the ACOSS conference last year, gave a series of ironclad guarantees: for example, the coalition would not place a time limit on the receipt of unemployment benefits, would not reduce the wages of young people and would maintain the real value of unemployment benefits. I believe that many of those statements will be proven to be false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the Prime Minister likes to raise from time to time the issue of employment, I refer to his own performance on the employment front when last he was Treasurer. I recall that, by the time John Howard left office as Treasurer in 1983, the unemployment rate in Australia had rocketed to over 10 per cent. That figure, as we all know, is far higher than that which he inherited under Labor at the recent election. What did 10 per cent mean to John Howard at that time? He likes to refer to figures from time to time on the level of unemployment. When John Howard ceased to be Treasurer in March 1983, he had more than 700,000 dead men and women dangling from his shoulders&mdash;700,000 dead men and women dangling from his shoulders in a work force only three&hyphen;quarters the size of today's work force. John Howard is condemned by his own performance on the employment front. There were 700,000 unemployed when he was the Treasurer of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also likes to raise from time to time the question of youth unemployment. What was the figure on the youth unemployment front when John Howard was last Treasurer? In 1983 John Howard had more than 164,000 teenagers looking for but unable to find full&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time work, which is nearly twice as many as today. He seeks to suggest that youth unemployment is an issue that the Australian Labor Party refused to pay proper attention to in government. John Howard is again condemned by his own performance as Treasurer, not just on the employment front in general but especially on the youth unemployment front. Those 164,000 teenagers in 1983 looking for but unable to find full&hyphen;time work were nearly twice as many as today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much for the promise in the election campaign that coalition policies will move Australia back towards full employment. I believe that, if we pursue the types of initiatives put in place by the previous government on the Working Nation front&mdash;many of those initiatives having arisen from the prod given to Australian industry by the training guarantee legislation to urge and encourage employers to invest in the training of their work force&mdash;we have a capacity in Australia to further improve our performance at a local enterprise, industry and national level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although we do not oppose the repeal of the legislation,  it in fact was a part of the partnership we put together for Working Nation&mdash;a commitment to invest in training and to create decent and targeted labour market programs. I wonder whether the coalition is going to rip away the legislation this evening and at the same time walk away from the commitment, the package, the understanding with the Australian community. I wonder whether the coalition will deliver on the requirement to actually invest, through proper labour market targeting, in the creation of training and employment opportunities for those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the current minister seeks to ridicule some of those programs and to suggest that they are not properly targeted. All I can say is that the minister ought to go out and meet some of those people, go into the community, look at the performance of some of those people, talk to them about how proud they are to have the opportunity to participate in some of the programs, examine their work and see the impact it has on their families and the community at large. That is what labour market programs and training are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1120"> about. If the minister wants to refer to a particular example, I will give one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently met someone in northern Melbourne who had been unemployed for 14 years. That person is now a new person because of the opportunities created. He is at Northland High School and I am prepared to take Mr Abbott to that college to talk to that person in order to see the impact of some of these programs and the pride that person now has in his work. He is job ready and will have the capacity in the near future to actually take up a full&hyphen;time or part&hyphen;time employment opportunity with an employer in industry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to the shadow minister just now, one would think that the Labor Party had just won an historic sixth term and that the shadow minister was in fact a minister of the Crown sitting on this side of the House telling the opposition what terrible ideas they had and what a wonderful job the government had done over the last 13 years and will continue to do over the next goodness only knows how many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you the message, mate: you lost! And do you know why you lost? Because the people rejected you. Do you know why they rejected you? Because you failed. And there is no better example than this act that we are repealing tonight of why Labor went wrong, yet you have the audacity to tell people like me to go out and meet real people out in the streets. You tell us to go out and talk to skillshares, to area consultative committees, to regional development organisations, to DEET and to CES employees. You have the audacity to tell me to go out and talk to all of those people. You, an ex&hyphen;ACTU president who probably has never been to one of those things, come in here and tell us how to run the world&mdash;yes, from the viewpoint of an ex&hyphen;ACTU executive.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Training Guarantee Act 1990 was brought in to improve Australia's training effort. That was the intent of the act. At the time, I was less than happy with the mechanisms the government was using in order to encourage and promote the objects of increased vocational education and training in Australia but I agreed with the overall objectives. The then opposition never opposed the objectives because we well recognised&mdash;not only then but earlier as well&mdash;the desperate need that Australia had to increase its rate of skill acquisition if we were going to be able to compete in the international marketplace, to improve productivity and take our place in the world as a major producer of goods and services, quality education exports and all the other good things that we do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were really three sorts of objects within that overall effort that the act was meant to address. One was to improve the quality of training. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know of no&hyphen;one from any side of politics or from any side of the bureaucracy or in any position within the training industry or the training market who would be willing to tell you that the Training Guarantee Act improved the quality of training. In fact, there is some evidence to suggest that perhaps the quality of training in some aspects actually decreased as a result of the taxation act itself. Because that is what it was, Mr Deputy Speaker; it was a taxation act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second object was to improve the quantity of training; the quantum of the training effort in Australia. I suppose that that was really the major reason why the act was brought down. There is no question whatsoever that Australia was then, and still is today, in desperate need of a real substantive lift in vocational training, in skills training, and in skills acquisition in the work force and for those who would enter the work force in order to improve our productivity and our performance. It is absolutely required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The jury never really came in on quantity. No&hyphen;one was ever able to prove that this act actually lifted the quantum of certified training. Certainly, we could say that one of the effects of the act, because it was a taxation act, was to cause companies to reorder their accounting systems to take account of pens <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1121"> and pencils and biros and paperclips and all the other things that went into the training, whereas before they had been part of general management overheads; but they had to segregate them out, so that effort did in fact produce some quantum information about the expenditure that went into structured training. But prior to that time there was one heck of a lot of unstructured training that always went on in Australia's businesses, and particularly in Australia's small and medium sized businesses. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was talking about the quantum of vocational education and training not having been sufficiently addressed by the Training Guarantee Act. Mr Deputy Speaker, when John Dawkins brought in this act, it was the stick versus the carrot approach. Let me tell you that I think that this bill was as great an example of how not to go about encouraging people to do things as anybody has ever seen in this country. It was a punitive measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a taxation measure. It was a taxation bill. It required people to keep records for taxation purposes, rather than addressing the training needs of Australia by doing something in a structural sense to really encourage particularly small business to do more training, to hire more apprentices, to hire more trainees and to participate with the group training companies, which I note the shadow Minister who spoke before me reckons are great institutions, and I absolutely agree. You would not find a greater proponent for group training companies in Australia in this House than the honourable member for Latrobe, and that is a fact. I have supported them since early l990 in the strongest possible and tangible way, and I will continue to do so because they are a great mechanism and they work well. I agree with the shadow Minister that the ACTU Lend Lease Foundation has done a superb job&mdash;an absolutely magnificent job&mdash;no question about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this act finally wound down to being was excessive regulation. This is an area where what is needed is encouragement. It does not really do much good to tell companies, `You must do this, do that, or do something else' and then ask them to use their resources in the best way they can to be as productive as they can, to be as profitable as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they can, to improve their balance sheet the best way they can, to add to Australia's wealth and to employ as many Australians as possible. Every time we whack on another regulation, what do we do?  We discourage more employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if you will, this was an unemployment act, and that in fact is probably one of the effects that it had. In l994 even Labor had given up on the act. It had been amended&mdash;I have forgotten now&mdash;two, three or four times. One of the amendments was to allow those companies which spent at least five per cent of their wages bill on structured training to opt out of the system. They did not have to report, but they still had to keep the records in order to prove the five per cent, and that was an onerous requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It did not really let many companies opt out I can tell you. The act required that at $200,000 worth of wages one had to spend one per cent of the wages bill on structured training. I have forgotten exactly how much it was, but that ramped up to about 1.5 per cent of wages expenditure&mdash;a quarter of a million dollars&mdash;having to be spent on structured training. It was not the quantum of the amount of money that needed to be spent on training, it was in fact the onerous requirements to keep records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill was really expected to raise lots of money. The early estimates were that it would raise between $10 million and $50 million a year, and some estimates put the revenue likely to be raised as high as $800 million. In l990&hyphen;91 it raised $3.2 million; in l991&hyphen;92 it raised $1.5 million; in l993&hyphen;94 it raised $2.3 million. The cost to the Treasury of administering the act and the program was greater than the revenue received. There is a good reason for that too, because if you actually paid the tax&mdash;the levy&mdash;then you got taxed on it as well because it was not tax deductible. So it cost you not only the amount of the levy but 39 per cent of the amount of the levy as well in income tax. That was a terrible disincentive to paying the levy, I can tell you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what happened?  What happened was that TAFEs, private providers and new growth companies that got into the market to provide so&hyphen;called structured training, offered all sorts <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1122"> of packages to divest employers of their hard earned money, calling it training in order that they could prove that they had incurred the expenditure so that they did not have to pay the tax and saved 39 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a tax. The Labor Party loves taxes&mdash;absolutely loves taxes&mdash;and they will, I am certain, in the term of this parliament, propose taxes. They will be happy to propose taxes. They certainly will oppose our spending cuts in order to fill up Beazley's black hole, and they will instead want to raise taxes&mdash;all kinds of new taxes, because Labor loves taxes. That is in fact what the training guarantee levy was&mdash;it was a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point needs to be made about that tax, and that is the fact that they brought in the tax at the beginning of the greatest recession since World War II, the recession that we had to have. There were companies out there struggling, going bankrupt, falling over one by one. What did we do? We put another onerous requirement on companies to spend and to keep records at a time when they were under extreme stress, when unemployment was ratcheting up, when corporate profits were going through the floor. At this time the Labor Party brought in another regulatory requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor loves regulations. In the life of this parliament we are going to rid the statutes of one heck of a lot of regulation. We will free the market up so that small businesses in particular will not be required to keep all the records they have in the past. Small business will get a better break and get a chance to produce and be profitable and to hire some more people so that we do not have this continuing high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can come up with all the mickey mouse schemes in the world that you like. You can say, `Ah, this is the best one we ever devised, and that one was the greatest one that anybody ever had' but, fair dinkum, they are all just programs, are they not? They do not address the structural problem. The problem is that if there are not jobs then not everybody is employed. What we need is people who employ people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are going to hear a lot about that over the next couple of weeks when my colleague <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) introduces the new industrial relations bill. This is something that we have talked about in this place for so many years that it is not even funny. Finally it is coming to pass, and won't it be a great day? We will relieve industry of some of the onerous requirement of regulation. Labor loves regulation, but we do not like regulation so much over on this side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The records that the ATO required to be kept were very onerous for some out there in the real job land&mdash;for instance, for major retailers. This is direct evidence, shadow minister; you ought to listen to this. There is direct evidence about some of the big companies, such as Myers. They had to spend a great deal of money in dissecting the actual cost of training, because they were training people at this store, and in that department, and in another store and a different department, and all over the place. They had to try to put the training cost in a little basket all by itself, which was very costly. It cost so much that they reduced the amount of training that they were doing. They reduced the number of hours of real structured training in order to comply with the act. That is dumb.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another reason why the act failed is that some companies spent so much on administration that they found they had to reduce training altogether. And there were other companies who, when they finally did the records, found they were spending five or six per cent of their wages bill on training. At the time of this great recession they decided to cut back on training expenditure because they were not spending what the bill required them to. The act said 1.5 per cent, but they were spending five per cent. They decided they might as well cut down on what they were spending. It makes sense, does it not? We did not exactly enhance the quantum of training through that mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">TAFE and private providers touted for gifts so that companies did not have to pay the income tax proportion. They did. Do you know that TAFEs, which we are supporting&mdash;taxpayer dollars, federal dollars, are going to support the TAFEs&mdash;were placing ads in newspapers begging companies to send them <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1123"> gifts of money to satisfy their training requirements because that gift counted as if they had been doing training for themselves? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few seconds that I have left, unless someone proposes an extension, I just want to say that this bill was a failed measure by a failed Labor Party in order to accomplish something that really had decent and good objectives: they were to increase the amount of vocational education and training in Australia, to increase skill acquisition by people who really need it, to assist in the production process and to assist Australia to become a wealthier country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This piece of legislation is pretty non&hyphen;contentious in terms of the substantive measures that it contains. I do not think that there is anything here that we are opposing. In fact, we are supporting all the specific measures in the legislation, including the repeal of the training guarantee and associated legislation and a couple of minor amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to spend most of my time talking about the higher education and schools implications of some of this legislation, but I would like to make a few brief comments about the repeal of the training guarantee. As the previous opposition speaker, the member for Batman (Mr Ferguson), no doubt pointed out, we believe that while it was in operation the training guarantee performed a very useful purpose in catalysing the significant change in the whole training culture in this country. It is demonstrable that there has been a substantially increased training effort since the introduction of the training guarantee. In particular, a very high proportion of many medium sized businesses that previously might not have had any training activity of any significance at all have in fact engaged in significant training activity sufficient to meet the requirements of the guarantee. So I think it is fair to say that there has been a significant improvement as a consequence of its introduction.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of that significant culture change that has taken place and other associated developments&mdash;such as, in the context of Working Nation and other initiatives, significantly expanded entry level training opportunities, the introduction of the training wage and so forth&mdash;it was our view that it was appropriate in the first instance to suspend the measure for two years; and before the election, we gave an undertaking to abolish it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I think we agree with the appropriateness of taking that measure at this time, we do not resile from our belief that the training guarantee was an important measure to catalyse and bring about a substantial change in industry's attitude towards training. At the time it was an appropriate and effective measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a couple of more general comments about the coalition's approach to training and labour market program assistance to the unemployed. For several years I was a minister in the employment, education and training portfolio with specific responsibility for delivery of labour market programs. I am concerned that the coalition, both before the election and since, has tended to deprecate the significance of labour market programs, particularly those sorts of programs which might be of shorter term duration and which might not fall within the mainstream training and education assistance. There has been a tendency to say that these are basically ineffective mickey mouse measures that really confer no real benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that that is the case at all. I think the evidence is very clear when you are talking about people  who are particularly disadvantaged in the labour market. I refer to people with a long duration of unemployment, people with multiple sources of disadvantage&mdash;they might have problems with literacy or English language, they might have particular disabilities, or there might be a range of factors that make it very hard for them to succeed in the labour market without special measures to assist them. There is no doubt that to substantially cut or curtail access to labour market programs will be very detrimental for those people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1124">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence that I recall when I was minister was that, while participation in a labour market program may not guarantee that a severely disadvantaged person seeking a job will get a permanent job, there is no doubt that their chances of getting some sort of reasonable opportunity, and particularly a full&hyphen;time unsubsidised work opportunity, are greatly magnified through participation in these programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some talk about the so&hyphen;called displacement effect that programs of this type might have. You cannot simply focus on the numbers getting jobs who participated. You have to take into account that they might be displacing some others who might otherwise have taken the same jobs. Obviously, there is a lot of truth in that displacement effect. But part of the approach of Working Nation, part of what we tried to achieve as a government, is to ensure that you do not get a large pool of people, hundreds of thousands of people, more or less permanently alienated from the labour market so that you have a situation where unemployment and all the personal characteristics and so forth that are associated with unemployment are passed from generation to generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think there is a more significant social priority for us in this country than to avoid the entrenchment of that kind of stagnant pool of people who just are more or less permanently excluded from the labour market. Labour market programs, which, as I said, the coalition have tended to devalue, have a critical role in avoiding exactly that scenario. They do make some contribution to net employment creation, I believe. I think the evidence is there on that. There is a substantial displacement effect, but even that displacement effect is worthwhile if it avoids, as I said, this consequence of large numbers of people permanently unemployed&mdash;a permanent underclass of unemployable people. That is what we have to avoid in this country, and that is what these programs are very much oriented to doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> If you go back to the mid&hyphen;1980s and look at our performance in that area in comparison with other countries, particularly European countries, you will see that we were a rela tively poor performer in terms of the proportion of total program expenditure that was devoted to what you might term `active' as distinct from `passive' income support measures. Since then there has been a significant change in the balance, and I think the change has been very much to the good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We read speculation that the coalition are going to make major cuts in these programs; they probably think that there is not too much of a political price to be paid for that. Maybe they are right. Maybe there is not too much of a political price to be paid for it, but there is a very substantial and significant long&hyphen;term social cost associated with it, and that fact needs to be taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the amendment to the Higher Education Funding Act. This, again, is obviously not controversial. It basically corrects an anomaly in an earlier piece of legislation so as to enable payments to be made in the calendar years 1996, 1997 and 1998 to support the open learning initiative, the open learning agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of the open learning agency was, again, something I was very closely associated with as Minister for Higher Education. One of the things that struck me when I entered the higher education portfolio was that in this country we had developed a very substantial strength in terms of institutions developing courses for distance type delivery. We had hundreds of courses which had been developed for delivery in this mode. It seemed to me that that was a great strength that we ought to try to do more with and in particular I thought there was merit in having some entity which would act as a brokerage agency and enable people to perhaps pursue a coherent course of higher education study that might bring together course streams that might have been developed in a number of different institutions. With the distance mode of delivery it ought to be possible for people to draw on the strengths of a variety of institutions rather than being constrained to the one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was a time also where there was great controversy about access to higher education. It was the period where we had high levels of so&hyphen;called unmet demand and there was also a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1125"> lot of interest in the potential of new technologies to improve access to education and training, to free the delivery of education and training up from the constraints of time and space. There is obviously a variety of technologies there. The traditional methodology has been to use broadcast television, radio as well as print materials but my view at the time was, and now is, that the great growth area and the greatest potential lies in the development of computer based technologies that take advantage of the Internet and which provide that added element of inter activity that you do not get, for example, with the use of the broadcast media or the print media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly enough, Mr Speaker, I have a home computer connected to the Internet and I have been looking at a number of web sites around the world. The United States has literally thousands of courses that you can now do over the world wide web which is a part of the Internet. I think that is very exciting and it seemed to me that we ought to be promoting that. So those two concepts of having a brokerage which could bring together courses from diverse institutions so that people could pursue coherent programs of study but without being constrained at a single institution and combining that with some of the new information technology seemed to open up a huge potentiality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did have a pilot program in this regard in the early 1990s. It was TV based and that was reasonably successful so on that basis a much broader concept was developed around the brokerage model and a number of delivery methodologies. The government in 1992, the former government, agreed to fund the open learning initiative. In effect, the key delivery agency was a consortium based around Monash University that set up the open learning agency, and that has been operating for, I think, three years now, and it has been a significant success I believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of weeks ago I attended a ceremony to deliver the report of an evaluation team based at the Centre for the Study of Higher Education in the University of Melbourne. This report was an evaluation of the effectiveness of the open learning initiative. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Frankly, it was very encouraging because there was some scepticism expressed at the time that this was introduced as to whether the amount of money available and the per unit costs that we were looking at could deliver a reasonable quality product that was comparable to on&hyphen;campus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just quote from the overview of the evaluation report and some particularly encouraging statements, and I quote statement 9:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall quality of course offerings in the opening learning initiative is equivalent to that of on&hyphen;campus and distance education subjects in the same fields.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the relatively low per unit amount being spent on these courses is a pretty significant achievement. Then it also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In broad terms the benefits of the open learning initiative to key stakeholders in the initiative, the students, the unit providers, the Commonwealth, the ABC and the community generally have well justified the costs involved.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>So it has been a very cost effective measure. The statement concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The open learning initiative has had a significant influence on the broad Australian community, as well as specifically on the tertiary education sector.</PARA>
<PARA>At the ceremony to launch this evaluation report to which I referred, one of the key addresses was delivered by Professor Robinson, Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of South Australia, soon to be Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of Monash University. He commented on how the initiative had affected his own institution. His view was that it had brought very major benefits, quite apart from the improved access directly provided, to the internal culture of the universities that participated. There are 21 universities that have now provided some 230 courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Robinson made the point that it has pushed ahead the whole agenda in terms of credit transfer, that is, institutions giving credit for courses done in other parts of the education training system; that it has really moved that agenda ahead to an extent which would have seemed very difficult to imagine just a couple of years ago. So, apart from the direct impact of providing access to education to a whole raft of people, some 20,000 or so <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1126"> people who would not otherwise have had access to higher education, it has moved ahead a number of key agendas within the institutions that are involved, and that, I think, is very important, very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is worth noting that, to get off the ground with something like the open learning initiative, you really need the piloting phase. It is very important that you try a few things, on a small scale initially. This, I think, highlights the importance of what is now described as the discretionary funds component of higher education funding. That term is now used to refer to a number of components of higher education funding apart from the mainstream operating grants and the capital programs and targeted research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are now two main elements in the so&hyphen;called discretionary funding component of higher education funding. There is the national priority reserve fund and the money that was set aside for the quality assurance program. The national priority reserve fund was designed to have a bucket of money that the minister could use on a discretionary basis to support certain nationwide initiatives that were of significance to the whole higher education system, as distinct from one particular institution. The pilot program for the open learning initiative was a typical example of the sort of thing that was funded under that program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition said in their pre&hyphen;election policy that they would eliminate those discretionary funds. They seek to imply that, really, there is nothing much of significance involved in that and there will not be a significant cost associated with that. I believe there will be very significant costs. The quality program, which is the other main component of the discretionary funds, is something which undoubtedly has brought major benefits to Australia's higher education system. That is very clear from the introduction of that quality initiative back in l990&mdash;started in l994&mdash;in which a committee completely independent of government and the bureaucracy, people associated with the higher education system, systematically evaluated and reported on the performance of higher education institutions against a number of key benchmarks. That initiative <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has unquestionably brought about a major culture change within institutions in terms of their attitude towards quality assurance in teaching, in research and in respect of community service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting rid of that is going to be a very major negative for the system. Getting rid of the discretionary elements in the national priority reserve fund will also mean that initiatives like open learning will find it far harder to get off the ground because there simply will not be those discretionary funds to go through the piloting process that you need in order to establish such a thing. Open learning has been a major boon. I do not think it would have happened given the kind of funding structure in higher education that the coalition are proposing to put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On schools, again the specific measure in the bill is uncontroversial. It simply enables the payment of an extra $20.7 million to non&hyphen;government schools for capital purposes in the latter half of this calendar year. We obviously support that. It was something that we were going to do, so there is obviously no argument about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I note in passing that even if the coalition adheres to the promises and commitments they have made in the schools area&mdash;you would have to say that is doubtful given their performance in other areas such as higher education where we have seen iron&hyphen;clad commitments repudiated&mdash;it is a pretty unsatisfactory effort. For example, if you look at the capital program, the coalition pledged an additional $30 million over the next three years which, added to the base funding of $77 million a year, would mean capital funding for the non&hyphen;government sector of $87 million a year during that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1127"> Taking into account the information technology initiative that was proposed by the previous government, the coalition will be spending $87 million compared with what we would have been spending on capital purposes over the coming quadrennium of around $120 million a year. In their pre&hyphen;election commitments the coalition proposed nothing extra in capital for the government schools. The Labor government at the time proposed an additional $120 million, all of which was to be incorpo rated in this initiative to facilitate improving access of schools to information technology. We regarded that as a very high priority&mdash;the establishment of EdNA&mdash;and also wanted to make sure that both government and non&hyphen;government schools each had computer centres so that the students would have access to the necessary hardware and could participate. We regarded that as a key part of the capital funding program. Half of that funding was to go to government schools and half to non&hyphen;government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is doing nothing extra for the government schools and substantially less than we were proposing to do for the non&hyphen;government schools. If you are making a comparison of the two parties' commitment to school education, it really is a lay&hyphen;down misere. Our commitment is far stronger and more substantial than the coalition's in that key area.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.17 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in favour of the proposed amendments contained in the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, on two grounds: firstly, the failure of the training guarantee scheme to make a meaningful difference to the effective skills and management development in this country and, secondly, that it has been a regressive scheme for business, in particular, on medium to small businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened with great interest when the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) mentioned that when the training guarantee scheme was introduced it was necessary but that if businesses were left to their own devices they would not train. I have been involved in the training game for over 18 years and I can tell you that businesses have been training for a lot longer than when the scheme was first put into place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman also raised the Karpin report as a justification for the training guarantee levy, saying that companies needed to invest in training. I do not disagree with that recommendation from the Karpin report. It is important for Australian companies to invest in training. After all, the No.1 asset of their businesses is their employees. Do we do this through an imposition on business? I will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be arguing that we do not and its imposition has been very regressive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also spoke of the need to invest in companies dealing with the export culture. I do not disagree that companies need to look at their export culture. I certainly have seen quite a few examples of organisations that could improve in that area. But is it up to government to impose what an organisation's culture should be or is it up to the organisation itself? I cannot think of an example when an organisation's culture has changed significantly, if at all, based on the latest ideological fad of a government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a belief held by certain members of the House that all that is required to create a cultural change is to introduce a new tax and then spend the booty&mdash;tax and spend. Never mind that the country is in no position to afford such expenditure. The training guarantee scheme is the point at which this theory is put into practice. In particular, business has had to cop the excesses of this overzealous approach to taxation. The logic is: business makes the money, so it can afford to give it back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not unfair to assume from the actions of the previous government that members in the caucus were saying, `Look, we can tax business because, even if the business community does not vote for us, we will always have the support of the battlers.' On 2 March those battlers moved away in droves. If business is asked to share a disproportionate amount of the tax burden to fund programs, even those programs that were created with the best intentions, then at the end of the day there will be no jobs to offer the battler and the battler will turn against those who tax the business that employs them. That is exactly what has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the financial impact of the training guarantee scheme. To date, collections from shortfalls have totalled around $2 to $3 million per year. In other words, the levy imposed on businesses was inadequate to cover the cost of running the scheme. No doubt the shortfall has been swallowed by the $8 billion black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allow me to put such expenditure into context. The coalition stated quite clearly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1128"> throughout the campaign that the tax burden placed on businesses&mdash;the paper and compliance burden&mdash;would be reduced by 50 per cent in the first term. This is not the political climate in which we would proceed with unproductive programs which are costing the taxpayer dearly. A constructive review of all job training schemes is necessary and, in the case of the training guarantee levy, long overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one is against the principle of developing and training that most valuable asset&mdash;the employee. The training guarantee scheme was created to increase the quality and quantity of training provided by industry&mdash;a noble endeavour. Let us examine the degree to which it has been successful and, above all, examine the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The structure of the training guarantee scheme has never been appropriate. The setting of a minimum amount of expenditure simply did not work for business people in my electorate of Deakin, in Melbourne's east. The scheme was not administered in a way that suited the training needs of many businesses. It was expensive, time consuming and impossible to enforce to the letter of the law. In a last&hyphen;ditch attempt to improve the scheme before it was suspended, a rollover provision was introduced. The reasoning behind this was that businesses desperately needed a degree of flexibility, and that businesses run their operations not necessarily year to year but within a much longer term framework. But even that is of little benefit to employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Deakin there are approximately 8,000 small businesses, most of them built up through the hard work of owner-managers. When the former Prime Minister said, `This is as good as it gets', he was talking about such small business. He was asking them not to hope for much more. I believe we can make things a bit better for such people, and the abolition of this scheme is an important step in that direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation which put the scheme into place is symbolic of the former government's lack of commitment to small businesses. The Labor Party&mdash;shackled by the residues of outdated, left wing, ideological norms&mdash;never recognised the importance of small business <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as  a job creator, as the true engine room of employment growth. Financial demands are being placed on those business people who are struggling to survive. We are making huge demands on their time and resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where are the managers of small businesses in my electorate going to find time to get through all the paperwork? In my constituency those business people often do not even have time to spend a weekend with their families. They are toiling, trying to survive in a tough economic environment. Why make things harder? At the same time we are urging businesses to expand into the global market, and we are telling them that they are the masters of their own destiny in terms of world trade. Let us help them to get rid of these anchors which are holding them down&mdash;anchors such as the training guarantee scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I talk about small to medium businesses rather than large businesses because it is widely known that it is small business that is being hardest hit by this scheme. I speak with some authority and experience on this subject. As I mentioned yesterday in my maiden speech, I spent most of my professional life working in human resources. Training providers I have worked with and spoken to have indicated that major big business employers have not had to change their training programs as a result of this legislation, and major employers have not been at all affected by the decision to suspend the legislation. Amounts of 1.5 per cent, if not more, of companies' payrolls have been and are still being spent by these companies on their employees. Business and employers in general do not plan their futures based, as I say, on such ideological principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should come as no surprise to find out that the scheme did not significantly affect the training expenditure of big business. All we need do is look at the ABS figures to get a glimpse of this. The ABS figures reveal that, of the 58 per cent of employers who claim to have increased their expenditure on training, 38 per cent reported only a small increase. It is my impression that expenditure increase was more prevalent among small businesses. Big businesses did not even notice the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1129"> scheme. Small businesses, of course, increased their expenditure&mdash;but only because they had to. It was a forced compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before entering parliament I worked, as I say, as a human resource practitioner with companies such as Kodak, Repco and a number of other large organisations. I also acted as a consultant for automotive, printing and financial industries. So I believe that I know something about the training programs of large companies in Melbourne, and the failure of this scheme. And as a former member of the American Society for Training and Development and the Australian Institute of Training and Development, and a continuing member of the Australian Human Resources Institute as well as the Organisational Psychology Board, I am fully aware of the vital role of training and professional development in the work force. Without good training programs, a company, while it may not necessarily be doomed, certainly is taking a backward step in its growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for the previous government to apply big business training standards on smaller businesses, which are less capable of meeting the challenge, is simply unfair. It is like a flat tax on business. It is as though Rupert Murdoch were being asked to pay the same amount of tax as a small manufacturing business in Melbourne's outer eastern suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who have never had a chance to see how the scheme was implemented in the real world, it is important to understand the kind of training which is being offered to young Australians with that 1.5 per cent of the payroll of every business. The training provided is occasionally worthwhile and worthy, but often it is not. Often businesses, when confronted by the 1.5 per cent requirement, will opt to put the employees on unnecessary or downright irrelevant training programs. Small businesses understand the cost of employing training staff or qualified training advisers; at $1,500 per day for most of these training advisers, it is not cheap for a small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I have heard of an interesting example of how the scheme can go horribly wrong. I was discussing the issue with some of my con stituents and I came across what I call `the forklift syndrome'. A company needs to meet the 1.5 per cent quota fast. What does it do? It decides to spend some money building a training room&mdash;in other words, a type of conference room with a whiteboard, which will be used only occasionally. The company prefers to do this than give the government that 1.5 per cent which will not be put back into its business. More likely than not, it will pay for the wage of a bureaucrat who has been given the unenviable task of monitoring this mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But back to the forklift example. The following year the company decides to spend the cash on forklift training. It decides to spend that 1.5 per cent by giving everyone forklift driving certificates&mdash;never mind that only one or two employees will actually have the responsibility of using a forklift. I ask the opposition: how have we helped that company; and how have we helped Australia with the training guarantee levy when it is such an impossible scheme to enforce?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ6">Mr BARRESI</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that the opposition may call it multiskilling. I call it a waste of resources that could be better spent creating jobs for young Australians. At the heart of the issue is: what do we mean by training&mdash;do we mean spending money or providing experience that will better equip Australians to tackle the workplace of the future? In many small businesses, the best training is in fact hands&hyphen;on work experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As if all of this were not evil enough, some of Australia's unions have decided to join the fray. Several group training providers have told me of their encounters with unions. I am appalled by what I have heard. The CFMEU has attempted to introduce a training levy into enterprise bargaining agreements. The deal is that companies pay their 1.5 per cent&mdash;or whatever the levy may be&mdash;into a union fund and the union then agrees to provide training in industry. To an outside observer it would appear that there is nothing sinister in this agreement, in the same way that to an outside observer the training guarantee scheme may <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1130"> seem like a good way of providing Australians with quality training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at how the unions plan to put the scheme into place. In a nutshell, it is like a union super levy&mdash;a way for unions to accumulate power and to control money. There are no assurances that the company that coughs up the money, that coughs up the levy, in the first place will actually receive the benefits&mdash;receive their quota of the training dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give you an example of how this works. In my electorate in Melbourne's east it is an issue of particular relevance. The Outer East Training Group in Ringwood took the ETU to the Industrial Relations Commission because the union was promoting its own training arrangements and then muscling companies into accepting only workers trained through their schemes. The companies that decide not to go along with the deal will then presumably be banned by the union. The Outer Eastern Training Group is one organisation challenging the ETU on grounds of restrictive trade practices. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also rise to speak on this bill on the basis that it has failed to deliver effective skills. The findings of the Karpin report present us with a clear indication that the trainee guarantee levy has failed to deliver on its principle objectives. The scheme had the purpose of increasing the quality and quantity of training provided by industry. The Karpin report was commissioned after the March 1991 economic statement&mdash;no doubt as part of then Prime Minister Bob Hawke's grand vision of turning us into a clever country. We know how much of a noble vision that has become. All we need to do is to ask the former minister for science, Barry Jones, for his views about that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arising from this strategy, the industry task force on leadership and management skills came down with some findings&mdash;the Karpin report. The task force identified that imparting management skills is about upgrading the capability of TAFE and business support, harnessing the talents of diversity and achieving best practice management development. The training guarantee scheme is not the means to achieve these ends. I would venture <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to say that achieving best practice is a far more effective means of proceeding, as companies that embarked on the ISO 9000 programs have demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is through such competitiveness amongst the companies themselves to achieve these standards that we are finding companies investing money, finances, resources and time into training. They do not need the imposition of a scheme. I speak on this subject with some authority. Back in the 1980s when I was involved with Kodak, with Ford and Nashua it embarked on total quality management. I have seen, as part of that, other companies trying as much as possible to regain the competitive edge. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the opposition's position, as was outlined by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), on the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill. I will be speaking on the value of the training guarantee levy to Australian industry, relating to both the training and the employment of people, and I will also briefly refer to the need to continue a number of labour market programs that were started under the previous Labor government, for the same reason&mdash;their contribution to training and employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened very carefully to the two government speakers&mdash;the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Barresi). I was disappointed at their hardline approach. Certainly, I expected them to be critical of some aspects of the legislation; that is only natural. However, to suggest that there were no benefits whatsoever in the training guarantee levy and in the policies of the Labor government is quite unrealistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They talked about small business. Sixty per cent of the people that work in my electorate of Greenway work for small business. Small business cooperates quite extensively with a number of labour market programs that have operated in the electorate of Greenway. During the period we are talking about we have had a number of New South Wales state governments of all political persuasions&mdash;from the Unsworth government through to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1131"> Greiner government and the Fahey government. In all cases, these governments were cooperating with the federal government to create a training culture for Australian industry. So I find it very difficult when I hear members opposite being critical and putting their hardline approaches in opposition to what this legislation has achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise in the debate to defend the principle of the training guarantee levy, even though this piece of legislation will remove it from the statute book. I recognise and acknowledge that in 1994 the Labor government suspended collection of the levy when the Working Nation programs were introduced. Nevertheless, I tell this House that the principle was a good one and, by its very existence, forced employers and their employees to come together to face the fact that in Australia none of them was doing anything constructive about the training and retraining of our work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This levy focused Australian industry for the first time on the need to train the work force to meet the demands of the 1990s and into the next century. If it achieved only that, then it was a success, and Australia will in time reap the benefit of forcing all parties in industry to put their money where their collective mouths have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years there have been numerous conferences, seminars, workshops, et cetera&mdash;you name it, it has been done&mdash;but nothing practical had happened to begin the process of training. When moving the second reading on the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1990, the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in April this year indicate that there has been no significant growth in structured training from the levels estimated for the same period in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>That clearly puts a lie to the statements that have been coming from the other side of the House that industry was training enough employees to meet their own demands. Clearly these figures disprove that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This statement supported the generally held view that industry, on average, did not train sufficient workers for their own needs. Particularly in periods of economic downturn, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> training was seen as a cost and, accordingly, was one of the first items to be cut back to meet the cost reducing policies of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Training Guarantee Act was introduced to raise the level of staff efficiency and knowledge of Australian enterprises, both in the private sector and in the public sector. Many sectors of the Australian economy had become concerned that the skill base of Australian industry had been eroded, leaving firms increasingly less able to compete both internationally and domestically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surveys conducted by the ABS had shown that many firms did not undertake any training at all and many more provided only minimal training. The Training Guarantee Act was designed to improve the efforts of firms which did not invest in training or invested very little. The government favoured the scheme because it did not penalise those companies which did recognise the value of training and invested in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For firms that already trained above the required minimum level, the levy had no financial impact at all. There were some notable firms in this area, including Email whose record in staff training and retraining is a shining beacon for all industry. I am not here to attack industry and say that there was no training whatsoever. In fact, what I am saying is that it was unfairly distributed. A number of major companies did train and trained large numbers of people, but there were many others who did not train at all and actually stole the skilled people from those industries that were training people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had some first-hand experience, through my trade union activities, of dealings with companies such as Email. My union had a large number of members working in that establishment. I want to make this very clear because people on the other side of the chamber do not seem to understand the degree of cooperation that does exist in industry&mdash;certainly in the metal industry. One would think, if we listened to what comes from the other side, that we are at war with each other all the time, that there is fighting, but that is not the case. There is a large degree of cooperation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1132">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was happy that my union was involved with the training programs of Email. In fact, I knew the director of training, Brian Jones, personally and was involved with him on a number of training programs and a number of training committees set up by the state government, including the New South Wales Board of Vocational Education and Training. I have nothing but praise for companies like Email, and there are many others which did train and trained very well. My criticism is of those industries that did not train but pinched people from those industries that were training people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question that Email did pull its weight. At that time, when there was a shortage of trades people, the New South Wales government, particularly the New South Wales railways department, also employed a large number of people. This was during a period of economic recession. To take up the slack that was out there, they employed more apprentices than they really had to. At one time there were over 600 apprentices at the Chullora Training College run by the State Rail Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pity that the downsizing of government organisations such as the State Rail Authority and others now prevents us from training the numbers of people we should be training for industry. I can only hope that this government will give some consideration to setting up group training companies such as those that were operated by the State Rail Authority with a view to training people for industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to accept the fact that, historically, industry does not train enough people in total for their own needs. This has been the case over the last 20 years. When there has been an economic uplift, there have not been enough skilled workers to fill the jobs required. So there is a need for governments to also become involved in training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal Labor training policy was based on the need to increase the level of industry investment in training. There were at the time far too few firms shouldering responsibility for training. That responsibility should have been shared by industry across the board. The Training Guarantee Act was an integral part <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the federal government's strategy to increase industry's investment in training. Its aim was to give Australia the necessary skills it needed to be successful on domestic and international markets. The government's aim was to develop a training culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was clear that companies which did not provide structured training for their employees would eventually be disadvantaged compared with those which did make that investment. Again, it should be noted that there were not too many making that investment. They preyed upon the work forces of those companies which did and stole their best people. The training guarantee was designed to change the attitude of such predator companies and encourage them to regard training not as a cost to be avoided but as a long&hyphen;term investment in their most valuable resource, their own employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In spite of the federal Labor government's good intentions, they were unable to get any substantive commitment by employers to increase on a voluntary basis the level of training. With apparent widespread concern that training staff were being poached by firms not prepared to invest in training their existing staff, the Commonwealth government felt obliged to take action to bring about a training culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another feature that was influencing the federal government was a significant move away from manufacturing industries and blue&hyphen;collar occupations. In the early 1980s there was a job loss of over 90,000 positions in the metal manufacturing industry. Since the late 1980s, however, a massive restructuring of industry has taken place, driven by increased competition, globalisation of production and trade, economic recession and technological change in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1133"> As a result of these changes, the skill content of jobs was undergoing continuous change and was becoming more advanced. Problems had also emerged in the latter half of the 1980s with further reductions in metal occupations as well as clerical occupations, resulting from retrenchments in electrical and gas industries, and government enterprises such as rail transport. This has resulted in a shift of employment opportunities to the ser vice sector and new growth occupations of tourism, hospitality and information technology. This shift in gross employment required a considerable industry response to training which was simply not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was against this background that the federal Labor government introduced the Training Guarantee Act. In order to meet the requirements of the legislation, employers were obliged to spend an amount equivalent to a proportion of their annual total payroll, if above the threshold, on eligible staff training each year. The designated proportions for 1990-91 were one per cent if the amount was over $200,000, rising in 1993&hyphen;94 to 1.5 per cent if it was above $226,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eligible training included in&hyphen;house courses such as on-the&hyphen;job training&mdash;I am sure all companies would be involved in that type of training&mdash;office skills, computer training courses, external programs such as off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job apprentice training, conferences and seminars directly related to the employer's business activity and contributions to training institutions such as TAFE. Equipment to be used in training, such as whiteboards and overhead projectors, could also be claimed against the Training Guarantee Act. I heard the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) complaining about this fact, but if this equipment was not being used all the time for training it could well be used for other parts of running the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firms which did not meet the training guarantee levy were obliged to pay to the Australian Taxation Office the shortfall between the amount determined as their proportion and their expenditure on eligible training. Self&hyphen;assessment applied. An employer needed to submit returns only if reporting a shortfall. Moneys collected by the Australian Taxation Office were to be distributed to state and training authorities, to be used for training activities and enhancement. It is important to have recorded the fact that moneys collected were very much lower than expected, indicating I suggest a general acceptance by industry of the need to enter into the spirit of the government's initiatives and to increase their commitment to improving the skills of their work force.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there were much publicised examples of luxurious and imbalanced use of the training guarantee levy by management and workshop employees, these were few and far between. In fact, most of the participants were responsible and genuinely trying to make up for the years of neglect in the training area. In the main, this levy did succeed in helping to develop a training culture in Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government might seek to make some sort of political mileage on the passing of this bill, let us never forget that the mere presence of the legislation has meant that in Australia today large and small companies now see training as a major part of their daily operation, not some unnecessary evil that was simply reflected in sending a couple of executives off to a luxurious hotel overseas, which was then called training and claimed as a tax deduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having been involved in the training industry for quite a period of time through my activities as a trade union official, I am very proud of this piece of legislation, which I do believe served its purpose. It is and was a totally defensible piece of Labor legislation that I hope we never have to repeat, for it would be to our nation's commercial peril if we ever backslid to the days of almost nil training within industry, with parasite companies feeding off the few responsible and committed companies. Perhaps the new minister needs to consult those far&hyphen;sighted companies like Email and others to ensure that he does not create a return to the bad old days by a slavish commitment to an outdated ideological dogma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer briefly to a number of the labour market programs carried out by the previous Labor government which I think in themselves also contributed to that training culture and proved the need for training and, more importantly, got the community involved in training. What it meant was that training was then carried out at the grassroots, close to where industry needs were, so you had a position where unemployed people were able to be trained for jobs that were actually available in the area where they lived.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1134">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mission Employment, a Salvation Army organisation, brought out a report on a number of activities of their skillshare operation in western Sydney. The area itself runs from Sydney to Katoomba and out to Campbelltown. They refer to a number of courses that they had run under the Skillshare organisation: the headstart course, where they had an 88 per cent success rate; the wood trades, a 60 per cent success rate; desktop publishing, a 60 per cent success rate; other employment related services, a 90 per cent success rate; open entry&hyphen;exit computer courses, a 91 per cent success rate; food and beverages, an 87 per cent success rate; and overall placement from the centre, an 87 per cent success rate. The success rate relates to people being placed either permanently in jobs or in ongoing training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that organisations such as the Salvation Army and other organisations that run Skillshares are now very concerned about where their organisations are going. In their report they make further reference to some of the federal government's labour market programs. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exciting new work opportunity programs are developing which provide unemployed people with on&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training. The mission is coming up with creative ideas for training opportunities which fit needs in the employment market, and the new work opportunity program is flexible enough to fund them. Currently, there are programs training people to work in TV stations, in nursing homes and personal care and in building maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the skillshare and other labour market programs under the previous Labor government were an outstanding success. But now, because the new government has underestimated the cost of their own promises and overestimated savings from their own cuts, we see an immediate reduction in the staffing of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Some 1,800 people will be retrenched in the first instance. Funds are going to be cut by $1.5 billion, leading to a cut, I feel and fear, in a number of these Working Nation programs that have become so successful for the people in the Greenway electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The organisations running skillshare projects in the Greenway electorate, such as the Salvation Army, are very concerned and very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> worried about the future of these worthy programs. I ask the government to reconsider their policies towards these Working Nation programs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking today in support of the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. This bill deals with three issues: repealing of the Training Guarantee Act 1990 and the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990; the continuation of funding of the open learning education initiative; and the provision of an additional $20.7 million in capital funding for non&hyphen;government schools, which was part of a 1992 commitment by the previous government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me address first the issue of non&hyphen;government schools. One of the fundamental principles of Australian society is the right of families to choose state or private education providers for their children. In 1985 the Labor government set up bureaucratic hurdles which had the effect, if not the intention, of impeding the establishment of new non&hyphen;government schools. But, despite these hurdles, the number of students actually attending the independent or non&hyphen;government sector increased from 26.4 per cent in 1986 to over 29 per cent in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Non&hyphen;government schools have always provided Australian parents with a choice, in particular of non&hyphen;secular education. The majority of our independent school students have always been in the Catholic education system, and no&hyphen;one can suggest for a minute that those schools are elitist in their fee structure or are selective in their entrance requirements in all cases. So it is rather strange, given the philosophy of the Labor government, that these sorts of schools really were impeded in terms of their further expansion. The point about the non&hyphen;government sector schools is that they provide much&hyphen;needed competition within the education industry. In fact, much of the innovation and best practice in our schools in Australia has come from the non&hyphen;government school education providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1135"> It was only six years ago, halfway through the Labor government's 13-year term of office, that we had the second lowest educa tion expenditure per student relative to our GDP compared with all other OECD countries. In fact, only Ireland was spending less on education than we were in that category. We are still struggling to overcome the problems of wanting to be a clever country but underfunding our education systems. So we should not discourage parents from choosing to educate their children independently, since these families save the states on average $1,800 per child in education spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government's attempts to impede the schooling choices of Australian families suggest that it was grossly out of touch with the aspirations of Australian families. It misunderstood the freedom of choice, which is a very essential part of Australian society. I therefore very strongly support the effect of item 2, which amends schedule 3 of the State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992. This provides already committed capital grants for non-government schools for 1996 and 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn my attention to open learning. The amendment to section 22A(3) of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 enables the minister to approve grants to open learning organisations for the years 1995 to 1998. It is quite obvious that open learning has added substantially to the educational offerings and opportunities in Australia. It adds flexibility and diversity to the offerings of our universities and TAFE institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, the off-campus modes can easily be adapted to the needs of our ever increasingly diverse student populations. Open learning assists the older students who perhaps cannot get out of their homes, those students who are less mobile and students who perhaps have young children and family responsibilities. In particular it helps regional Australians who, as we all know, have substantially less access to education when compared with their metropolitan counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give an example of how less accessible it is for regional Victorians to attend an educational institution when compared with metropolitan Victorians. In 1990, about the time open learning began, the population of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> almost 500,000 people in northern Victoria had access to only 3,690 higher education places within the region. This was one place for every 140 people, compared with the statewide provision of one place for every 40 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991, 71 per cent of the population lived in urban areas, but students from these same urban areas made up 79 per cent of the higher education population. While 25 per cent of Australia's population come from regional areas, only 19 per cent of higher education students come from these regional areas. So we have marked inequality of access and inequality of participation by regional students in Australian education. At least open learning goes some small way towards changing some of those disadvantages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me draw particular attention to our problems with agricultural education. Not only do all rural students have fewer opportunities to study locally but also they are severely restricted in their choice of courses. I want to talk about that area of agricultural education. Eighty&hyphen;four per cent of all degree and postgraduate places in agriculture and horticulture in Victoria are in metropolitan Melbourne, while nearly 55 per cent of students actually enrolled come from rural Victoria. So it is a reality to travel outside your region for full-time education and training or part-time education and training. But that is a substantial cost to families beyond metropolitan Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even with our government's broadening of the access to Austudy for the asset rich and the income poor, whom you find in our agribusiness sectors in particular, too many of our regional families cannot afford to send their students away to train. The lack of regional courses in particular disadvantages our part-time and mature-aged rural students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the studies. We know that in 1993 the Melbourne University's Centre for the Study of Higher Education evaluated the open learning education system and found that the system had been substantially successful. There was no evidence that students were receiving a lower quality of education compared with their on-campus counterparts. There was also a greater understanding of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1136"> credit transfers as we progressed through open learning, after its first establishing years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We found that students and staff in institutions became much more skilled in multimedia use. In fact Australia has been most innovative in multimedia use in its educational areas. About one-third of our open learning courses have broadcast television and/or radio components, and these rate very highly. In 1995, on Saturday mornings over half a million Australians watched open learning TV broadcasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Open learning students do not need to meet entry prerequisites when they enter into this formal education undertaking. For many Australians, that is a very important lowering of the barriers for them to enter into and participate in education. They can select courses from a wide range of providers. So, quite clearly, open learning education is quite excellent in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am concerned that we do not go down the path of suggesting that open learning is ever seen as a substitute for face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face post&hyphen;secondary education in regional Australia. It is essential that we continue to have excellent, locally available, face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face educational offerings in regional Australia. It is essential for our regional development and for our peer group interaction amongst educational providers. Distance education and open learning must be seen as supplementary and widening the choice, not as an alternative delivery mode for rural people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be further expanding our open learning offerings as an export earner for Australia. They could quite clearly further our interests in Asia and the Northern Hemisphere. They could promote an understanding of Australian society, its natural resources and its business potential. So I strongly commend this government's support for open learning through this amendment. I hope it will continue to flourish with the proviso that it is never seen as a substitute for face-to-face interaction and teaching in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally I come to the third part of the amendment: the training guarantee scheme. This was introduced in July 1990 by the previous government. The aim was to increase the quality and quantity of training provided <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by industry. These objectives were very worthy, given our comparatively low levels of investment in on-the-job training and the need for us to deepen our skills in particular as we tried to keep up with the ever evolving marketplaces in nearby Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the strategy adopted was flawed. Externally imposed requirements on business to divert resources to training did not help, especially during the recession `we had to have', and do not necessarily improve business culture in relation to training. They certainly do not improve the quality or relevance of the training provided by a business. Consequently, we all know of so many examples of mickey mouse courses and trainers who sprang up all around the country to take advantage of the sudden desperate urge for businesses to spend some dollars. Boardroom extensions were redefined as training rooms. In short, honourable intentions were too often defeated by inappropriate, naive tactics which put industry offside at the very time we needed a spirit of cooperation and a recognition from businesses of the costs of an underskilled work force and the productivity benefits of increased skilling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor did this training guarantee levy address the chronic maldistribution of skilled labour or professionals such as we see hampering Australia's regional development. For example, there is an oversupply of health service professionals, engineers, law graduates and administrators in the cities and a clustering of urban businesses, and there is a chronic undersupply in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at a couple of our industries which, if this had been a workable, successful scheme, should have benefited and overcome their chronic lack of a skilled work force by now. Let us look at the food industry in Australia. It is amongst our three largest industries, employing more than 220,000 people and producing goods worth over $35 billion. Its exports totalled more than $10 billion in 1994 and its predicted growth rate is five per cent per annum over the next five years. It has very real opportunities for export growth, and the dairying industry is one of our best performers in the export market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1137">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the food industry is currently undergoing a period of rapid technological change in primary production, processing, preservation, packaging and transportation. The industry has to use new and innovative technology and the most skilled marketing to capture and protect fast evolving markets. But despite these needs, the industry is chronically short of skilled workers at all levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, in my electorate in the Murray, Goulburn and Loddon valleys, which include Australia's biggest dairy export sector, we are critically short of locally based skilled staff. The training guarantee scheme did little to address or encourage the local businesses in the food sector to change. In particular, let me talk about the fruit harvesting industry in the area. We have a chronic shortage of experienced and motivated pickers to efficiently harvest the fruit crops each year. This problem exists all around Australia. Between January and March we need a minimum of 8,000 people alone in my electorate, and harvesters' wages represent between 25 per cent and 50 per cent of the total production costs of each orchard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have found that only 10 per cent of pickers come back after each season. In 1995 a survey of the orchardists found that one of the industry's greatest concerns is the shortage of skilled seasonal workers. Pickers, when they were interviewed at that time, said there was little training provision in orchards or elsewhere. The harvest labourers who were interviewed said they had no awareness of the task or what was expected of them by the employers&mdash;the growers. The growers had no specific training for their orchard supervisors, and these gangers were expected to manage work teams of 15 to 25 workers effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Victoria Fruit Growers Association responded to the money requirements, if you like, in the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 by developing a picker training course. However, only one orchard formally provided this course to its harvest labour. Quite clearly, the top&hyphen;down approach did not work when we faced the needs of industry on the ground. That is because the training needs cannot be addressed by such a levy. They are multifaceted. They need a multifaceted approach.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, a new post-training guarantee levy era is now operating amongst the harvesters and growers in the Goulburn and Murray valleys. It is through cooperation between DEET, the CES, the Northern Victoria Fruit Growers Association, the processors and a whole host of growers that a local harvest labour office has been established. With only one full-time worker, last season there was a substantial improvement in training and in growers understanding the needs of their orchard supervisors. So by adopting a different approach, the industry managed to turn the situation around somewhat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other problems associated with training which only the government can assist with, and they relate to enticing pickers to come and stay, especially the numbers of international backpackers whom we depend upon. At the moment the system relating to unemployment entitlements creates disincentives. If those previously unemployed who have become pickers work more than 13 weeks, they must wait longer to have unemployment entitlements re-established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you do not have a tax file number, after 28 days your tax rates jump from a minimum to a maximum&mdash;as they should. Too many pickers do not have tax file numbers and so the labour turnover is not helpful. For working international holiday&hyphen;makers&mdash;the backpackers&mdash;tax rates vary from 29 per cent to 47 per cent. It is not really worth while for them to do the work. We need a coordinated, cooperative approach with government. This government understands those problems and will work with industry. It will not simply impose a levy from above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me talk about another local initiative&mdash;the Northern Industries Education Board&mdash;which has brought local food manufacturers together to cooperate in Australia's first program designed to attract and retain local students doing years 11 and 12. They want to keep them in the region to become our next generation of highly skilled food technologists. We have 13 students this year doing years 11 and 12 and they are being mentored by 20 or more of our biggest manufacturers in the region. They are being paid $100 per week while they do more than 100 days work <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1138"> experience each year. They will end up with a VCE qualification, TAFE accreditation, and they are on their way to obtaining a food technology qualification which we hope will turn around the future for young people and create a different perception about local industry work opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this has come about through cooperation and not through a training levy imposed from above. The local dairy industry is now pursuing a similar path to substantially reduce the farm apprenticeship scheme to a number of months. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> As I was saying, the dairy industry has had a major problem in attracting and retaining its dairy apprentices. In 1997 students will be able to complete six months of a proposed dairy operators traineeship while they complete their VCE. They can then go on to Dookie College in the region for two or so days a week. They will receive credits towards a Bachelor in Applied Science (Dairying) at Melbourne University. This will substantially improve future training; it is the opposite to what was offered in the training guarantee levy, which was a top&hyphen;down imposed effort which bullied individual businesses. This UDV local initiative is not the result of a training guarantee levy; it is the result of industry cooperation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's fine; I am talking about the training guarantee levy. This dairy industry iniative is an example of how training issues are multifaceted. They require multifaceted inputs and cooperation between numbers of different players. That is why the guarantee training levy failed so abysmally to address rural training needs. I have referred to the food sector. It is crippled at the moment with insufficient skilled workers from the primary producer through to food technologists and world best marketers. Thank heavens this amendment is now before the House and we will see no more of that nonsense where we wave a wand and say, `Unless a business spends X number of dollars on training, it will be punished and the money will be taken away anyway.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have now is a different system. In regional Australia, local business cooperation is now the order of the day. You do not have cooperation with government when you have to comply with bureaucratically complex requirements in accounting for the dollars you have spent on training, arguing that you will have an overhead projector put into your boardroom and that counts as a training room when, in fact, the week before it was your boardroom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Businesses were forced to see the government as the enemy in terms of training. Now in this new era we see small business recognising that the government of the day is not the enemy; it is in partnership. It is creating an environment in which local initiatives are able to be developed. Therefore, we will see a real skilling of Australia, which is what it is all about. I suggested to the House earlier that rural Australia has a chronic shortage of skilled people. I have also suggested that we must ensure that open learning, while a great initiative, never replaces face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face interaction and education available to people in country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the Labor government's past performance on independent school funding, particularly in regional Australia. In my electorate there are many ethnic minorities and they are extraordinarily concerned if they do not have access to non&hyphen;secular education. The Labor government made it difficult for people from a non&hyphen;Anglo background to choose, perhaps, a Muslim school and for people in impoverished rural areas to choose Catholic education if that is what they wanted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment&mdash;these three different initiatives&mdash;is a reflection of what went badly wrong for the Labor government. You had the rhetoric about mediocrity being where we had to be&mdash;that is, you politicised the state school system. People left the schools in droves, seeking independent education for their children. But you tried to block that exit by making it difficult for those poor struggling parents to find independent schools of their choice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Murray (Mrs Stone) made some important positive points but, as the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) in his contribution will point out, many of these programs which she referred to are in danger because of the proposed massive cuts which the new government has foreshadowed in relation to education, employment and training programs. We have had a wide&hyphen;ranging discussion on these three issues in the debate to this point. I also want to range over them, but I want to make more general points which have not yet been made in this debate or indeed in the debates which we have had including, unfortunately, many of the maiden speeches by members opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When listening to the maiden speeches I have tried to work out whether the new government has any general philosophy to speak of, especially in the area of social justice programs, employment programs, education programs and training programs. It has been widely reported that John Howard, the Prime Minister, won the election on the basis of going to the people and basically saying, `Well, trust me. I'm going to do a better job than Labor,' without putting forward any real concrete program. We have been waiting since the election to hear more <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about what sense of vision, philosophy and direction they are going to have for this country, but we have heard very little indeed from them.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These programs were, of course, the hallmarks of what made Australia in the last decade a reasonable social democratic society. They were programs in the areas of unemployment, education and training which went to the heart of the sorts of things that we have to do in order to give people some sense of their worth, some sense that they belong in society and some sense that society is committed to giving  them social justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have had from the Prime Minister and from the government generally is nothing more than opportunism. All we have had is the idea that they do not entirely agree with the Fightback package or with all the New Right measures. This is what they have been telling us. But, on the other hand, they do not tell us what philosophy they have or what sense of direction they have which is supposedly going to substitute for the Fightback measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are using this fictional idea, this so&hyphen;called $8 billion hole, as an excuse in order to create a situation in which they bring back that same old New Right philosophy which they claimed to the Australian people they no longer believed in.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are much further to the right than anyone in the Labor Party, I can assure you of that, mate. In fact, some of them were described as being to the right of Genghis Khan by a commentator I heard the other day. But that is another matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me contrast this lack of philosophy, this lack of direction and this idea of cutting here and cutting there for the sake of cutting programs rather than having any coherent framework or any coherent set of directions with the kind of direction which the Labor Party was committed to&mdash;and continues to be committed to&mdash;in this area. First of all, we should go back to a basic premise. The basic premise is that society is concerned not only with economic efficiency and economic wellbeing but also with social justice for all its people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the case, then there are certain very important principles that need to be put into place. In particular&mdash;as I have emphasised in my writings and in discussion and as was emphasised by the Labor Party at its last national platform&mdash;there are certain social rights that people are entitled to. These social rights include the right to employment, the right to be prepared and trained so that you can gain employment and, in addition, the right to a decent education. Of course, the other rights are the right to decent health care and the right to proper housing. These fundamental social rights are in addition to the kinds of human rights that we all agree with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But these fundamental social rights are often challenged by conservatives and, if you look at the New Right tradition that arose in Britain and the United States&mdash;Thatcherism and Reaganism, which were the favourite philosophies of the current Prime Minister until recently&mdash;you will find that they present <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a direct challenge to these fundamental social rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have heard about the intentions of the government in relation to employment and education clearly shows that there are going to be serious cuts in these areas which will affect the government's ability to deliver on these fundamental social rights. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me say to you in relation to this matter that we are extremely concerned, firstly, in relation to the employment programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Working Nation structure that was put into place was not put into place simply because, as the conservative parties have said, there was some manic desire on the part of the Australian Labor government to spend money on programs; that is a nonsense. It was put into place because there were recommendations to the government, stemming from a green paper on employment, which effectively said that the government had to put into place a job compact in order to try to secure employment for people who, even if there were an economic recovery, were unlikely to find employment.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The long&hyphen;term unemployed, as the shadow minister said. In fact, the authors of the green paper&mdash;I quote from the committee's report&mdash;had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic growth will continue to be crucial in stemming the flow into unemployment, but past experience shows that it is not enough to reduce the number of people subject to long&hyphen;term unemployment as quickly as we would wish. More must be done to assist them into worthwhile jobs through improved labour market programs including delivery responsive to their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The labour market functions less efficiently when there are large numbers of people who are not strongly attached to the labour market and less able to compete for vacancies when they occur. Hence, for both equity and efficiency reasons, the Committee has proposed the introduction of a Job Compact.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>So the committee's recommendations were taken up by the Labor government and, as a result of that, significant and very important programs were put into place&mdash;a whole range of programs under Working Nation which were intended to assist the long&hyphen;term unemployed through training, through further <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1141"> education, through vocational guidance and through assistance, even at the level of the Commonwealth Employment Service, so that people were looked after and cared for in terms of their employment needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what do we find? What does the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) keep saying? He says that Working Nation is a failure, that Working Nation should never have been put into place, and that Working Nation is wrong. All of these things he has said and he continues to say, notwithstanding the evidence that, without Working Nation's expenditure and without all those many programs, we would have been in a position where the long&hyphen;term unemployed would not have been assisted in the dramatic way in which they were assisted in the last two years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And now, as the former minister, who was responsible for many of those programs and who did an excellent job in that role, says, they have frozen the funds. And they are now talking about cutting out dramatically all those programs. The question that has to arise is: how then are we to ensure that even if&mdash;and it is a very big `if', judging from the way this new government looks like it is organising the economy, because every time you ask a question of the economic ministers they behave as if they have not even understood an undergraduate lesson in economics and most of them do not even know the basic interconnections between economic factors&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They lack a good Labor education.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have not had the proper education in economic theory to understand even the most basic matters. So whether they will do any good on the economy is a very moot point. In fact, one suspects that, whereas we should have had significant economic growth this year, we will probably be in a difficult position as a result of their endeavours. As a result of that, unemployment is likely to increase, unfortunately, and the long&hyphen;term unemployed, the people whom the job compact and the Work <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ing Nation programs were intended to assist, will be in a very difficult position indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have to ask ourselves: is it a fact that Minister Kemp and Minister Vanstone in the Senate, who seems not to know what the hell is going on, are going to bring in the same actions which they foreshadowed in the Fightback package&mdash;in other words, cutting out programs that assist the unemployed and cutting out programs that assist those workers? I believe, particularly given Dr Kemp's previous writings and his total embracing of the New Right philosophy for many years, that that is their agenda, that that is what they want to do and that they are simply trying to use this nonsense of the so&hyphen;called $8 billion hole as an excuse to bring back into the Liberal Party, into the government of this country, the philosophy which they claimed they had disowned at the time of the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going to be the consequence for real people? The consequence is going to be that those unemployed people will not have those programs available to them. As a result of that, we will be in such difficulties that we are going to become even more problematical as a nation in terms of poverty, in terms of the consequences of unemployment and in terms of some of the social problems that we have. I predict that we will have more and more social problems as a result of the agenda which the conservative government is putting forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is another matter which concerns the question of education. What have we seen in the area of education? We have seen further proposals for dramatic cuts in the area of education, plus total abdication of responsibility to the states. Already we know what has happened in some of the states&mdash;and most of the states are run by Liberal administrations. What has happened? Most of those Liberal administrations are actually cutting education. Look at what happened in Victoria, for example, under the Kennett regime, a disgraceful performance in education. And what are we going to do? We are going to hand more power, in school education particularly, to the states and we are going to get out of it altogether, according to this new idea of federalism being put forward.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1142">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what will happen to the education of our young people? The federal government is going to say, `Oh well, never mind, it's not our business; it's not our responsibility; it's somebody else's responsibility.' That will mean that the possibility of achieving a just society in which every person has the fundamental right to education, a proper education and an education that leads to the fulfilment of their potentialities, will not be occurring. So it seems to me that we are faced with a crisis in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But then on top of this, as if this was not bad enough, what do we find? We find an attack on the higher education sector. We are now going to find an attack on our universities, on our TAFE colleges and on our other institutes of higher learning. We are going to find a massive cut has been foreshadowed against those universities and colleges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What kind of a government believes that it can actually get away with a massive cut in the higher education sector when it is trying to tell us that it believes in a competitive international market and that it believes in the training of our people? We have heard so many speeches, even in this debate, from the spokespersons for the government saying that they believe in training and they believe in education. Yet we are going to see these massive cuts in those higher sectors of education. Or are we to suppose that the only training that people need is up to the end of high school and then we forget about them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Crean interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The former minister says, quite correctly, that when they left government last time we had a disgraceful situation in this country where less than 30 per cent of children finished year 12. Now we have a situation in which more than 80 per cent of children finish year 12&mdash;and that figure is going up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have heard about the possible reversal of this in the school system, but even when people finish at year 12 they need additional training and education, they need the universities and colleges. This regime is going to cut out that factor.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another aspect to this. What about research? What about the advancement of learning? Australia has a very proud record in the sciences and the humanities in the advancement of learning. Our universities have participated in virtually all fields towards the advancement of learning in a very strong and important way. Many people have contributed to the total sum of human knowledge through their degrees, their research and their doctorates. What is going to happen to all of that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this massive cut comes through, will the research capacities of the universities not be affected? Of course they will. They will be seriously affected. We will find that our scientific endeavour and our work in the humanities&mdash;which, as I say, is internationally acclaimed&mdash;will be seriously hampered. In other words, as a nation we are cutting ourselves short.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last decade under the Labor government, our nation has been committed to excellence in education and to assisting in the development of our culture and our sciences. All of that is going to be threatened by the proposed cuts. The Labor Party is committed to a very different philosophy. Not only are we fundamentally committed to the idea of certain basic social rights but also we are committed to resourcing those programs and ensuring that there are sufficient programs for the education of all our children, including higher education of our young people and, indeed, those people who want to go back to universities and colleges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are committed to training and employment programs that are going to assist everyone including the long&hyphen;term unemployed. Therefore, we are committed to building a better and fairer society in which the principles of social justice not only are words but are also manifested in concrete programs that assist the community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me pleasure to take this opportunity to remind the House of the significant contribution that Labor made in its 13 years to developing the skills of this country. Essentially, it did that by recognising that it is the responsibility of government to invest in human resources&mdash;people capital. Clever countries <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1143"> are not clever unless they develop the skills of their people. Gone are the days when people could go into unskilled jobs. The simple reality is that young people who leave school before year 12 are twice as likely to be unemployed than those who complete year 12 or do better. There is a simple message in that: skill development enhances people's chances of employment. It is the passport to employment. The real issue is: how do we make training and skills development more relevant not just to industry but to the individuals who wish to pursue it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor made a commitment to expand significantly the funding at all levels. In relation to the schools, we put in significantly more money in real terms but, sadly, over recent years we have seen state governments take that money and use it for other purposes. We have the disgrace in the Victorian situation where, since Jeff Kennett has been in office, we increased funding in real terms to schools by two per cent and he has cut it by 10 per cent. Yet this is the direction in which the new government wants to go&mdash;untying grants and no commitment to ensuring funds destined for education end up in it. We will see the demise of the school system if it is left to the states without any discipline to deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor, in its 13 years, increased schools funding by 55 per cent in real terms&mdash;a huge commitment. In terms of the TAFE and other vocational sector, it increased funding by 56 per cent in real terms. It increased funding in excess of 60 per cent in universities, where we saw an almost 80 per cent increase in university places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That did not come about overnight; it was a progressive commitment by this government. A number of initiatives developed during our term in office. The training guarantee levy, which is what we are debating the abolition of tonight, was introduced as part of a commitment, a leverage, to ensure a shared responsibility to lift the nation's commitment to skill development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a position in which it was not only the government that was prepared to invest substantially more resources in education. The government took the view that industry <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should also contribute, and we believed that, if industry were to contribute, the individual also had a responsibility to make a contribution to higher education. It was from that concept that the HECS scheme, in terms of higher education, developed&mdash;a commitment whereby we said that people should repay the equivalent of 20 per cent of not the average course costs but the minimum course costs when they achieved a certain level of income, the principle being that university education gave them a better chance to a higher income. They were not required to repay this one&hyphen;fifth of the contribution until their income reached a certain level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were expected to make students make a contribution to higher education, what was wrong with the notion that employers and industry should also make a contribution? That is what the training guarantee levy did as part of the package that saw HECS and as part of the package that saw the massive commitment by this Labor government when it was in power to increase VET funding, skills funding and higher education funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House that, before the training guarantee levy was introduced, nearly 60 per cent of employers with payrolls over $200,000 provided any structured training to their work force. With the introduction and implementation of the training guarantee levy, the Australian Taxation Office indicated that that 60 per cent went to 90 per cent. So do not tell me that this did not make a contribution to requiring industry to focus on its responsibility to make a contribution. It was not to bear the whole cost. In fact, it was a very small proportion of the cost. But it was to at least make a contribution&mdash;not moralise about government or individuals having to do it but be part of the shared partnership, the shared commitment. That is indeed what the training guarantee levy was about and what it was designed to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that it was a pretty blunt instrument. I accept that there were circumstances in which certain courses qualified for training that were really mickey mouse operations. I accept that. I also accept that there was significant paperwork associated with satisfying the authorities that the contribution to training <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1144"> had been made. That is why, in the development of Working Nation some 2&half; years ago, I took the view, as the responsible minister of the time, that if we could find a better way of getting industry commitment to training we would get rid of the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in 1994, when Working Nation was announced, the levy was suspended. So the reality is that this levy has not been paid for almost three years. I made the commitment to  industry at the time, because I spoke to them in the implementation of Working Nation, that if they were prepared to achieve the targets that we set for traineeship growth, which was something in the order of 35,000 traineeships, we would abolish the levy. Going into the last election we made a pledge to abolish the training guarantee levy because we were not only going to achieve the 36,000 total; we were going to exceed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we are doing tonight with this legislation is implementing Labor policy. Let us face it: the training guarantee levy has not been paid for two, three years, and it was to be abolished if we were returned anyway. So let us not get carried away with the notion that this simple act will see a commitment by industry to advance the training agenda. You will only get that&mdash;and this is where I believe that the contribution made by the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) was spot-on&mdash;if you try to get an agreement with industry, a shared commitment to really develop the training agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just indicate what the position was when Labor came to power back in 1982-83, because I have heard the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) in this place parrot on about the numbers. The fact that he gets this wrong&mdash;just as he gets so many policy directions wrong&mdash;I think, is the reason that he is not the cabinet minister he thought he would be and responsible for this area of activity. The one thing I do have to give the minister credit or recognition for is his consistency&mdash;his ideological consistency&mdash;with the user&hyphen;pays principle of getting rid, effectively, of the role of government and making people do it on their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we saw under the Howard and Fraser government when it lost office in 1983 was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> apprenticeships at 34,800 per year&mdash;and no traineeships. Traineeships had not even been thought of in the scheme of things under that government. So the total number of structured training places under that government was 34,800. What is the number today? It is 96,500, comprised of 60,000 apprenticeships and 36,500 traineeships. They are the figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen not only a progressive growth in apprenticeships but also the fact that apprenticeships, as good as they are, are not attractive to employers, on the one hand&mdash;particularly small businesses&mdash;nor, on the other, to individuals because they do require a commitment in advance of three to four years. You expect young people to sign up to a program that they think they want to pursue and then get locked into it. What we have to provide if we are smart about getting the training agenda properly developed is flexibility: the opportunity for people to move in and out of structured training, or on-the-job training, with a proper system of accreditation and recognition&mdash;a national framework against which this can be judged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to see the huge growth that has occurred in traineeships, particularly over the last 12 months. Traineeship vacancies lodged in 1995&mdash;that is all of last year&mdash;were 23,707. That was double what they were in 1994. The year 1994 was when NETTFORCE was established, the vehicle under Working Nation to make the traineeships more relevant to individuals and more relevant to business. So you had a doubling between 1994 and 1995. But already this financial year, July to March, there have been 29,000 traineeship vacancies lodged compared with 9,200 in the same period last year. That is a trebling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are not just seeing a quirk. We are not just seeing a statistical blip. We are seeing an exponential growth in traineeships. In the March quarter of 1996 there were 15,000 traineeship vacancies compared with 4,600 in the March 1995 quarter. They have more than trebled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is this? If business is signing up, if business is demanding these things, if business is asking for traineeships and saying it wants people under them, that suggests we have the product right. If businesses were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1145"> walking away from apprenticeships, especially in a recession when they were not prepared to take the long-term view, if they were not attracted to the old, structured and rigid traineeships, we got the product right and the demand followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But how did we get the product right? It was not by some bureaucratic exercise, as the member for Murray tried to suggest before. We set up an organisation that was closer to what industry wanted and closer to what the industrial partners wanted. That body was called NETTFORCE. It was chaired by Lindsay Fox. It comprised Bill Kelty, Bert Evans, Joan Kirner&mdash;a number of people. They were not bureaucrats. They were people who understood what industry wanted and went out to industry and said, `We're prepared to tailor a traineeship program to your needs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard before the member for Murray talk about what has been done with the dairy industry. The simple fact is before NETTFORCE came along there was not a dairy traineeship. I had not only the opportunity to authorise the one that the member for Murray referred to but also the pleasure to see another development of this approach up in the Northern Rivers area. Rather than try to get traineeships lodged in terms of the farm, we went to the dairy cooperative because of its links with the farm and its ability to provide training opportunities not just on the farm but in processing and marketing&mdash;all of those things. This was the clever approach to getting industry involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the interesting thing is that, when you look at where the jobs growth has come over recent years, you will see that it is significantly in these sorts of areas. We are talking about general employment growth over 12 months in the order of 3&half; per cent&mdash;agriculture at over seven per cent; libraries, museums and the arts at 10.4 per cent; health services at 5&half; per cent; community services at 6&half; per cent; accommodation and restaurants at five per cent; food retailing at 5.6 per cent; construction at 6.9 per cent; wholesale trade at 3&half; per cent; sport at 11 per cent; and road transport at 11 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing about that is not only was there growth in jobs far in excess of what <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the national average is but also before Nettforce came along in not one of those industries was there a traineeship. If we are serious about saying that training and skills are the passport to employment and these are the areas in which the jobs are but there is no training to develop the people in question, how are we seriously going to say we are going to meet the skill requirements of those industries? Yet it was NETTFORCE that came along and provided that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has the current government done with NETTFORCE? It has abolished it&mdash;this most successful program in terms of creating the traineeships, getting a trebling of demand, opening things up in all of these areas. Considering all the rhetoric the government goes on with about getting closer to industry, what does it do to the one body that has finally broken through, the one body that has delivered? It abolishes it. Why? Because it is a Labor institution, because we set it up and the government cannot bring itself to recognise the contribution, the significant change, that Labor has made. What gall! The minister, after abolishing NETTFORCE, had this to say in the final paragraph of a letter to the chairman and none of the other members of the board:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to express my appreciation for your work and that of the other Nettforce board members. Your efforts have in no small way contributed to a considerable growth in traineeship numbers which we are now experiencing in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>`Thanks very much. Thanks, NETTFORCE. Thanks for breaking through. Thanks for doing what we could not do before through the institutional barriers, but we are going to abolish it.' That is why I say this government has no real view about where the training agenda is going. It does not understand what has worked. It does not understand the dynamics that have occurred within the industry over recent years and it does not understand the significant contribution that Working Nation has made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government think Working Nation is a welfare approach. They think Working Nation is just about recycling people. Working Nation had two fundamental objectives: getting the long-term unemployed back into the work force and lifting the skills of the nation. It <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1146"> was micro-economic reform because it was saying that we should not treat the long-term unemployed as being out of the work force, we should treat them as being useful, but they will only be useful if we can build their skills. If we are going to build their skills, we will expand the labour supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important if we are to keep inflationary pressures down that there be a strong demand for jobs. Labor created 740,000 jobs in three years. That is far in excess of anything you said we could achieve. You laughed at the figure of 500,000 jobs, but we actually created 740,000. It was not just demand we created; we also created supply. That is the reason, for the first time in the history of this country, we achieved record jobs growth without inflationary pressure. We achieved that because we were able not only to get the long-term unemployed back into any program but also to engage them in the types of skills that the economy was seeking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that there have been certain areas of skills shortage. I am not trying to pretend that that is not so. But I think you do have to look at the facts&mdash;supply increased, compensating the demand. And what are we getting for the first time? We are getting a labour market that is truly functional. All that will be put at risk. The labour market programs will be cut by the government, university places will be cut, ANTA funds will be untied and school funds will be handed back to the states with no requirement for them to be spent in education. Everything that Labor built over 13 years will be put at risk. This is madness with which you are going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst we do not object to the training guarantee levy being abolished, because it was our intention to abolish it, we do object to the philosophy, the direction, behind your training approach. I am sure that tomorrow we will see you also looking to cut into youth wages. You believe that the only solution to getting youth back into the labour market is to cut their rates of pay. The IR legislation will provide that opportunity. We will be using everything we can to expose that as well as to ensure that people understand the full success of Labor's commitment to training and skilling this nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise not to oppose the Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill but to point out that the new government's position is dominated by ideology in the area of education and training. That approach will have an impact not just on the overall economy but on my electorate of Grayndler, which is in the inner western suburbs of Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current government has criticised Labor's approach. When Labor introduced the training guarantee scheme in 1990, the then opposition screamed about it. They said that it was placing an unfair burden on employers. The fact is that the Labor government would not have had to have done that had employers responded by providing adequate training for workers at that time. What we saw at that time was very much a lack of vision. Large employers were focusing on the situation today and tomorrow rather than the situation in one, two or 10 years time. This also applied to the work force as a whole. This levy was introduced with a time limit and in conjunction with a gamut of government programs. These programs related not just to the quantity of job creation but also to the quality of job creation, which was a major focus of the Karpin report, known as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enterprising Nation</EMPHASIS>. In 1994, we saw that culminate in the Working Nation package, which was a tremendous success and achievement. In the 1993 federal election the Labor government promised to create 500,000 jobs in its next term in office. That promise was greeted with great scepticism, but the government went on to create over 740,000 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perhaps best to look at local examples, because when we talk about unemployment, we are not talking just about statistics, but about real people with real families and real needs. In the past few weeks in my electorate I have had much representation from people who are concerned about the government's ideologically driven approach. Someone who came to see me gave me a copy of a letter dated 9 May 1996 from a Mr Andre Kaspura of DEET to all regional managers in the Sydney eastern area. That letter was headlined `Approvals and payments of labour market programs'. The effect of that letter was that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1147"> this government has put a stop to all those programs which will give the unemployed an opportunity to get work. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After considering the situation, I have decided that approvals will cease for the rest of the financial year for the following programs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special Intervention, including assessments for ESL, literacy, psychologist and disability group training and SIP other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jobtrain, contracted and individual approvals, immediate minor assistance&mdash;only to be approved with local purchase orders. (No more automatic $100 approvals)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TAP (for the Aboriginal community), work experience, skills development, non&hyphen;accredited training, formal training, post&hyphen;placement support.</PARA>
<PARA>In a great show of compassion from this new government, this letter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please find attached a standard letter that may be issued to job seekers who seek assistance under the programs that are no longer approvable.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the previous government people could get a job after taking part in an English language program or after being provided by the CES with an automatic $100 worth of boots or some sort of work related clothing. They are now being told by this government, `Wait a moment, we have not decided what we will do in the area of education and training, but we have decided that we are not going to help the people of the eastern Sydney area to gain employment for the rest of the financial year.' The greatest indictment of that approach is that Labor's programs were actually working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just down the road from my office is the Marrickville Skillshare. Skillshare's funding remains under threat from this government. They are not quite sure whether the funding will continue until the budget is brought down or whether it will continue after that. But they know that there is no guarantee that they will exist after 30 June. Under the award, they have to give four weeks notice to their employees. So there is a great deal of uncertainty. People whose main task is to get others into employment are uncertain about their own employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it really means is that the coalition is stalling for time. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (Senator Vanstone) is not quite sure what she will do. She cannot quite get her head around what to do with labour market programs, so everything is just on hold at the moment. In their eagerness to slash the existing labour market programs, which were working, they are neglecting to recognise that there is a necessary cost in these programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Skillshares are one of most cost effective areas of labour market programs. The program is funded at $1,000 per head for each training and placement. Skillshare also has uniform national infrastructure, delivering the program across all regions and towns in Australia. If the coalition allows this infrastructure to be dismantled, it will be extremely difficult and costly to re-establish. The infrastructure which has been built up over the years will just disappear. The skills, the knowledge and the experience of those dedicated people who work in that sector will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise that Skillshares are, in effect, contractors to the Commonwealth government. Either the schemes get job seekers through the door or they go out of business. If they are not operating successfully, then the Skillshares simply do not continue to operate. The government needs to take urgent action to ensure that those Skillshares are not stranded without funding because, as I have pointed out, unless action is taken prior to 30 June, this valuable scheme will cease to exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Skillshare is certainly working in my electorate of Grayndler. So far in this financial year, Skillshare at Marrickville has already assisted over 750 people. It is not surprising given the nature of the electorate that 70 per cent of these people are from non-English speaking backgrounds, 60 per cent have been unemployed for over 18 months and 25 per cent have been unemployed for over four years. In finding those people real jobs, the success rate of people who have been referred to Skillshare at Marrickville is 60 per cent, and that is an outstanding figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a range of benefits and services provided to the clients in Marrickville. There is an intensive search for jobs, there is personal attention given to people who walk through the door, there is the development of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1148"> new job seeking strategies and there is individual counselling for people so that they are treated as real individuals and their individual needs are considered and looked after. As you walk in the door, there is a phone available for anyone&mdash;many people in my electorate do not have access to telephones&mdash;to use. There are also the local and state newspapers so that people can get assistance to look up jobs that they might be interested in. People can also get assistance with language skills to ensure that their chances of gaining employment are maximised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is group support so that the long-term unemployed&mdash;who experience isolation&mdash;are made to feel that they are not alone. A lot of positive motivation is created in this environment. Most importantly, all the employers in my electorate know that Skillshare is there. If they want employees, they know they can go to Marrickville Skillshare to get them. There is real access to jobs in the local area, and that cuts down on things such as transportation costs and costs of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Marrickville Skillshare is about placing real people in real jobs. Let me give you some examples. The Marrickville community nursery was established under the LEAP program. Forty&hyphen;five young people worked on this nursery project, which was aimed at growing plants indigenous to the inner west of Sydney. They went to areas such as the Cooks River, got seedlings, made sure that they were planted. A space was provided courtesy of the assistance of Marrickville Council at the Addison Road Community Centre and at the end of that program the nursery is still up and running. It has been a big success because residents have appreciated its positive environmental impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">LEAP has a 60 per cent success rate in finding participants full&hyphen;time jobs. Young unemployed have also gained employment through learning metalwork skills while assisting in the restoration of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">James Craig</EMPHASIS> sailing ship at the Sydney Maritime Museum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you do not hear the success stories of the young unemployed fighting hard to achieve employment, gain employment, continuing to look after their families while going on to get increased training and skills. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is a pity that the media concentrate so much on the minority. We saw the very disgraceful representation of the Paxton family, as if the young unemployed were happy about their situation. The overwhelming majority of young people are after training, education, assistance and long&hyphen;term real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of most outstanding local Skillshare success stories might appear a little odd. It was a project to find employment for agricultural scientists who had been trained overseas. Through Marrickville Skillshare 21 overseas trained specialists&mdash;from Bangladesh, India and Thailand&mdash;found employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Skillshare organised a seminar, held at the Marrickville Council administration centre, to launch the scheme. They invited employers and people from university research institutions and government departments. Out of the scheme came real initiatives and those 21 people who had been trained in Asia actually found jobs in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The areas in which they found jobs were very diverse. Two of them are teaching at James Ruse Agricultural High School in Parramatta. One of them is working on a wheat farm at Gilgandra. Many of them are working in research institutions attached to universities. Many others are working in the food technology area in private industry, with one employed at Sara Lee. The sort of commitment and dedication to meeting a challenge&mdash;people would be aware that the electorate of Grayndler is certainly not an agricultural area&mdash;exemplified by Marrickville Skillshare is something that we as a country cannot afford to lose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate about education and training should not be a debate about ideology. It should not be a debate which suggests that the free market will look after employment and that people will find so&hyphen;called real jobs if we just get government out of the way. That is just not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, and in particular the minister, have shown since the election that they do not really have a vision. The minister is bent on criticising our achievements but the criticism is purely ideologically based because we were getting it right. If you have a look across the spectrum of issues, particularly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1149"> those aimed at young people, you will see why our achievements in education and training are ones I am very proud to be associated with. Three out of 10 people were completing secondary school in 1983 compared with eight out of 10 now. Look at the growth that was occurring in apprenticeships and employment. No amount of gimmickry, of buses travelling around the country, will change the fact that in youth employment creation we also achieved significantly more than the coalition did prior to 1983&mdash;and most certainly more than we can expect in the coming months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government pursues its ideological agenda and its breaking down of labour market programs, it is not the Labor Party which will suffer; it is the people in my electorate of Grayndler who need those programs to get themselves into employment and the people of other electorates who will suffer. I hope there is a change of heart and the government resolves its confusion over some of these programs. I hope it gets rid of its ideological blinkers and recognises that creating jobs is something which government does have a role in. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to sum up the bill and conclude the debate. It has been a long and interesting debate, especially given that the bill itself, at least in so far as divisions are concerned, has been uncontentious. I suppose there have been three issues that have been touched on in the course of the debate. The first is the abolition of the training guarantee levy. The second is the provision of further funds to the open learning initiative, and the third is the provision of an additional $20 million for capital grants to non-government schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is bipartisan support for the abolition of the training guarantee levy. All of us, in a sense, have come here to bury that particular Caesar&mdash;except for the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who came not so much to bury Caesar but to praise him. The member for Batman seemed to think the training guarantee levy was a great measure. It was so <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> good that it was dropped by the previous government of which he was such a great supporter! The problem with the training guarantee levy was not the concept or the principle, but the practice. In 1993 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Good Weekend</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three years down the track, the act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the act establishing the training guarantee levy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has spawned an industry in which absailing down a cliff is called team&hyphen;building; in which cosmetics demonstrations are training for receptionists; in which gym membership is written off as a stress management program; and in which the definition of a corporate classroom is a five-star resort with a flying fox.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the training guarantee levy that the member for Batman praised so much. In 1992, the tax office released the results of a survey which found that 70 per cent of companies said that the levy had served only to create more administrative work; 63 per cent said that they were spending the same or less on training as a result of the legislation. This is the work of the former Labor government of which they are so proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A survey by Monash University's David Syme, Faculty of Business, found that after two years of operation only four per cent of companies had anything positive to say about the training levy; 60 per cent said the levy was not effective or hardly effective; and nine per cent admitted that they had undertaken unnecessary training just to fulfil the requirements. I guess the most outrageous example was that of the New South Wales Employers Federation, which planned a  four-day training seminar on a luxury river boat with four-hour lunch breaks and piggyback races in the afternoon. That is the kind of thing that the training guarantee levy created. It is no wonder that members opposite are so anxious to see this embarrassment dead and buried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are many labour market programs that both sides of this House could support. Like the member for Batman and members opposite, I, too, have seen labour market programs in action. I have seen the participants. I have seen the new hope, the new joy and the new exuberance on their faces; and, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1150"> believe me, it warms the cockles of my hard, conservative heart to see it. It is splendid. There are many labour market programs that no-one would want to touch. We do not want, on this side of the House, to eliminate labour market programs; we simply want to make them work better, and they can work better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my colleague and leader, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, said, under these programs we have people going in as pool attendants who cannot swim and who are allergic to chlorine. We have, under some jobskill programs, the cost of $76,000 to create a single job. This does not mean all the programs are bad, but it does mean that many of them can be improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite have talked a great deal about cuts. It is interesting, if we are talking about cuts in labour market programs, to see that the 1995-96 budget allocated $2.1 billion for labour market programs. Do you know what happened, Madam Deputy Speaker? Two billion dollars of that money was spent prior to the election; $2 billion of that money was spent trying to buy votes in marginal seats. We have had to borrow $30 million from next year's allocation to keep the existing slate of programs going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are all in favour of training. The difference between us and those on the other side of the House is that we are totally committed to on&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training; whereas, as the rorts associated with the training guarantee levy made clear, those opposite are more committed to off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training. Under the regime of the training guarantee levy an employer got no recognition whatsoever for taking on 100 apprentices; but if he sent 100 of his executives to Hayman Island for a week, it was a tax deduction. That was the ridiculous situation that operated under the training guarantee levy. I am not saying that it was a complete failure. I am not even saying that it did more harm than good. What I am saying is that it was not worth all the trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We want people to have faith in government on this side of the House; but we want people to have more faith in themselves. We want to build a better training partnership. We do not want to build a bigger training bureau cracy. We all know&mdash;because it happens to all of us every day in our constituencies&mdash;that people come to us and say, `I'm desperate; please help.' How can government refuse? It is so very difficult to refuse. But the tragedy is that if we always say yes, not only do we create a government which grows into a monster out of control but also, in the end, we totally destroy the self-respect of those people whom we are trying to help. Last week I went down to a youth conference at Mildura organised by the Sunraysia Area Consultative Committee of the Commonwealth Employment Service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear the member over there, an excellent member who is well and widely regarded by his constituents. The slightly upsetting thing about all those lovely kids at that seminar was that kid after kid stood up and talked about how someone else had to help them. I agree that we do have to do something for those kids; but not a single one of them used the words of President Kennedy, who said&mdash;and they are words worth repeating&mdash;`Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with our young people and our labour market programs is not so much financial and it is not so much organisational; at the end of the day the problem is cultural. What this government needs to remind people of is that every single person in this country is good at something, that every single Australian can do well at something and that every single Australian should have a dream; but government cannot give it to them. A dream is the gift that each man or each woman gives to himself or herself. This government is determined to give the Australian people a hand up. But what we must do is break the handout mentality that the previous government, often with the best will in the world, did so much to foster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government, now that they are in opposition, are obsessed with money&mdash;money that they constantly say we are not spending. But it is important to realise what money cannot do. Money cannot bring about a change of heart, a change of morale, which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1151"> in the end is the best solution for our unemployment problems. I want to quote from a report to the federal government by the Schools Council. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth government has never had any substantive evidence as to whether the resources which it has put into schools over the past 20 years have been effective in raising educational standards.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very sad situation. There we have the Schools Council telling us that for all our spending we cannot be sure it has actually raised educational standards. The trouble with the union&hyphen;dominated approach of members opposite is that they are always telling us that standards are rising when the union members in the schools and the universities are calling for a wage rise, and they are always telling us that standards are falling when they are asking for more money to employ more teachers or academics. The fact is that money is not the answer&mdash;a better attitude is. That is something which no amount of money by itself can solve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot have training for training's sake. I applaud the fact that policies of the previous government helped to raise retention rates from about 30 per cent to about 70 per cent. That is a very significant achievement, and the previous government deserves considerable credit for it. But let's be honest. If those kids leave school to go on the jobless queue, does it really matter whether they leave at year 10 or year 12? I applaud so many of the labour market programs that the previous government put into place. But, if at the end of them there are no jobs for those kids to go to, are we simply raising their expectations only to dash their hopes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, notwithstanding so much good work by so many tens of thousands of people&mdash;some in the private sector; some in the public sector&mdash;at the end of 13 years of Labor government we have so many programs doing so much good work but we also have, at the heart of it, an alphabet soup of muddle. There are something like 80 separate programs administered by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. We do not know just how much good most of them are doing. There is a blizzard of acronyms that people must wade through to try to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> understand exactly what is going on. I want to stress the good work that is being done by the department, by state governments, by local governments and by people in private business&mdash;many of whom are giving up hours of their time to help our people. What this government wants to do is ensure that there is a better return for all that good work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad thing about much of this debate is that speakers opposite have been living in the past. They have been trying to defend the record of the previous government. There was some good and some bad in that, but it has gone. It is a government which has gone. This government has hardly begun, yet listening to members opposite you would think that the world as we know it has come to an end. We have not had time for that. The fact is that we are getting on with the job of trying to ensure that the money we put into these programs is getting the result the Australian people deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few particular points were made by speakers opposite, which I would like to take in turn. Wages policy is one example. The member for Batman, leading off for the opposition, attacked the wages policy of the new government. We all know what the wages policy of the previous government was. The former Prime Minister boasted day after day at the dispatch box that he had kept wages down. That is no answer to the Australian people. Our policy is to allow people to earn the best wages of which they are capable. It is to allow people to strike the best deals they can between themselves and their bosses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite, such as the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), talked about university cuts. There have been no university cuts. Let me just refer you to some facts. Here I have Macquarie University announcing today an $8.8 million surplus or profit in 1995. That is not a bad result, and I applaud them for their work. I also have, from one of today's newspapers, North Queensland's James Cook University admitting that it is $20 million in the red. That is no good at all but, notwithstanding that, they say that they could manage a federal funding cut of up to seven per cent. I am not saying there are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1152"> going to be cuts; I am not saying that at all. What I am saying is that, whatever happens, it is hardly going to be the end of the world as we know it for those universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman talked a lot about wages policy. I have great hopes for the member for Batman. He is a fine man, but even the previous Prime Minister had a certain basic honesty. The previous Prime Minister knew that the real author of the 1982-83 recession was not John Winston Howard; it was George Campbell. It was George Campbell of the metalworkers union who had those 700,000 unemployed people hanging around his neck. What is the Labor Party doing to George Campbell? They are making him a senator. That is what they are doing. That is how they reward the author of the 1983 recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that wages fell under the ALP. We have all heard their claims about an unprecedented explosion of jobs. Yes, there was a great splurge of job creation. The tragedy is that most of it was part time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the member for Batman attack at the beginning of his speech what he described as coalition plans to amalgamate the department of social services and the Commonwealth Employment Service offices all around Australia. I am sorry the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) is not here to hear this, but the Manly CES office in my electorate is closing down. An announcement, if such be the word, was made just the other day by way of a letter from the CES area manager to local members of parliament. Do you know what it was about, Madam Deputy Speaker? The Public Service made a decision to rationalise that office late last year. They did not give a brief to the then minister because they knew that he would be too embarrassed to make a decision in the run-up to the last election, and the Public Service have closed it down. I do not want to stand up here as some kind of poor man's Bagehot, but that strikes me as a grave dereliction of normal Westminster principles and it is something that needs to be sheeted home to the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman talked about the rich mates of the coalition. That was a bit rich. Obviously, he is just a bit jealous that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bill Kelty never invited him along to Solly Lew's place. The fact is that the member for Batman's contribution, wordy in parts all too often, sounded like an election speech, which no&hyphen;one believed even before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The open learning initiative, which is to be supported by this bill, involves a $30 million investment by the Commonwealth. As a result of that money, we have about 9,000 equivalent full-time student places. That is a good value initiative in anyone's language. I am pleased to say that 75 per cent of those students are passing their courses. It is a splendid way of making degrees available to all.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PG6">Ms MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make this point clear right at the start: this is a Labor bill. This bill is almost identical to a bill introduced in this House on 29 November 1995 by the then Minister for Housing and Regional Development in the previous Labor government, Brian Howe. The reforms intended to arise from this bill and the subsequent negotiations with the states and territories were to dramatically improve the housing assistance for low income Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government carries out these reforms, it will be one of Brian Howe's many contributions to making Australia a more livable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country. There is no doubt that Brian would have agreed strongly with much of the general sentiment about the importance of housing assistance expressed by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) in his second reading speech. For example, he said that public housing and other forms of housing assistance do meet real needs and that they do contribute to a fairer society by addressing a basic human need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public housing and housing assistance in this country make a major contribution to reducing the number of people on an income which would normally condemn them to living below the poverty line. I think Brian would also appreciate the fact that the minister acknowledges that housing assistance is `based on the principle that all Australians have the right to affordable, secure and appropriate housing'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as the second reading amendment implies, there are some substantive differences between the Labor bill introduced last year and the bill we are debating tonight. They are differences that, at their core, are the essential differences between the coalition and the Labor Party. The differences between the two versions of the bill indicate clearly that the coalition is not about accountability, despite the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), that the coalition is not about forming enduring partnerships between the Commonwealth and the states and territories for the provision of social housing and, most importantly, that the coalition is not&mdash;certainly not from the evidence we have so far&mdash;about creating a system of social housing in this country which recognises that housing is more than just a house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Community and nation', which was released at the end of last year, set out Labor's commitment to fundamental reform of housing assistance for Australians on low incomes. It also recognised that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A nation's housing and the quality of its regional and urban development have a major influence on the life of individuals and the life of the nation . . . Housing is more than bricks and mortar. Our quality of life is intimately affected by our housing. Where we live can make the difference in gaining ready access to jobs, education, transport and community services. Housing shapes the social life <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1154"> and the economic efficiency of our communities, and it contributes to a sense of safety and security.</PARA>
<PARA>In `Community and nation', Labor was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . delivering a long-term agenda covering a wide spectrum, from housing to meet people's needs better, through improving regions and cities operating in the interests of their citizens and the national economy, to meeting broad infrastructure requirements at the national level.</PARA>
<PARA>We have shown by those actions that we recognise the relationship between all of these issues. Many of today's public housing estates, as the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and I know well, are now badly located relative to the availability of jobs or transport. They are in areas which were, in the past, areas of high work opportunity and where there was no need to travel long distances to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is true that the decline of particular industries has created local concentrations of hardship and unemployment, certainly in places like the northern suburbs of Melbourne. The 1956 Olympic village in my electorate of Jagajaga and the surrounding industrial estate are classic manifestations of this problem. As I said in my first speech in this House not very long ago, it is not good enough to tell people in these areas that market conditions have changed, and it is certainly not good enough to tell them that it would be economically rational to pack their bags and move on. For a start, of course, there are too many hundreds of thousands involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like most people, like all of us, they are attached to their homes and to their neighbourhoods. These neighbourhoods are generally very rich in assets and advantages that, with a little planning and investment, can be translated into economic opportunities. They should be renewed, not abandoned, and we should be encouraging a pattern of growth which is both socially and economically sustainable. The important message for tonight's debate is that public housing investment has a very important role to play in that renewal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agreements entered into under the Labor version of this bill were to operate for up to three years from July 1996, and were to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> involve Commonwealth funding of $1.68 billion in each of those three years. Agreements entered into under the coalition version of this bill will operate for only one year from 1 July 1996, and will involve Commonwealth funding of $1.068 billion in the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year, and only that financial year. Let us be quite clear on that point. Under Labor, states and territories had three years to plan the process of putting in place these very extensive and far&hyphen;reaching reforms to the provision of social housing and were guaranteed funding while this important work was being carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the coalition, the states and territories will have just one year to complete this process and have absolutely no indication as to how much funding will be provided from the Commonwealth beyond the end of the financial year we are about to embark upon. The states and territories of course are responsible for the building of new houses and the maintenance and upkeep of their housing stock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the arrangements being proposed by the coalition in this bill, states and territories will not be able to plan their more than $1 billion capital program. It is absolutely impossible to think about planning for a program of that size when you have no idea how much money you are going to get from the coalition&mdash;the Commonwealth government&mdash;in the coming years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor recognised that the radical reforms to social housing would take some time to introduce in a way that ensures that the reforms deliver improved outcomes for people in housing need. The interim agreements proposed by the previous Labor government allowed sufficient time&mdash;up to three years&mdash;so that many of the building blocks for the new housing model could be put in place. The arrangements proposed by the coalition in this bill create uncertainty. This is hardly an environment conducive to making sensible, sound strategic and forward thinking decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What, you might ask&mdash;certainly the states are asking&mdash;is the coalition's objective in doing things so quickly? The new time frames suggest that the priority is not to create better arrangements for people in housing need in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1155"> this country. I would like to think that this issue is so important, so urgent, that the time frame for implementing these reforms must be condensed. However, I suspect, along with some of the states, that the rationale is rather a budgetary one. It is simply yet another mechanism to reduce Commonwealth expenditure on housing assistance from 1997&hyphen;98 in order to meet the so&hyphen;called budgetary demands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous version of this bill was also explicit about the desirability of the Commonwealth, states, territories and local governing bodies working cooperatively on the design, planning and management of cities and towns. This apparently is no longer desirable. The reference to cooperation in these areas of endeavour has been omitted from this version of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What should we make of this? Is the coalition telling Australians that cooperation between these three levels of government is not desirable? Is the coalition telling Australians that it is perfectly possible to create a social housing sector which will function effectively without paying attention to urban and regional design and planning? It is particularly important that we maintain the momentum of urban and regional development and it is extremely disappointing, particularly I must say to me, that this government has made a deliberate decision to kill Labor's better cities progress, as witnessed by the removal of these words from the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The better cities program provided Australia with a template for the future. It was a practical example of the way in which many of the problems of urban decay and regional unemployment could be tackled in an imaginative way. It is true that unemployment is not just about a person's individual characteristics. It is also related to where people live and the opportunities for employment available in particular parts of cities or regions. Where one lives has an effect&mdash;and this is very important for this bill&mdash;on a large number of other factors. Some are obvious, such as the availability and accessibility of services and transport. But others are less obvious, such as the likely educational outcomes for one's children.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the aims of the better cities program was to assist in redressing the inequalities in people's lives caused by where they happened to live. The better cities program reflected a determination by the Labor government to recognise and take steps to address major problems in Australian society&mdash;a determination that the changes to this bill show is sadly lacking in this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the fundamental problems better cities and Labor's housing policies sought to address was that caused by structural change to the Australian economy. Much of our public housing stock was built in the fifties and sixties to house workers in areas where there were large concentrations of manufacturing industry, both in the cities and in the provincial towns. With the changes brought to manufacturing by the global changes of the last 20 years, many of these regions now find that manufacturing and the jobs associated have moved away or disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the same period, there has been an increasing trend to place social security recipients in much of this public housing. This has led to large numbers of people being trapped in areas where there are few employment opportunities. It is a very sad irony for all of us that the unavailability of affordable housing has this unfortunate outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stated earlier, the economic rationalist approach is that these people should just get up and move. Even if these people had the capacity to uproot themselves in this way, there would be a couple of immediate problems. The first is that there would be housing shortages in the new areas and people would be forced to live in substandard dwellings. The second problem, which is very important, relates to our massive investment in our public housing stock&mdash;over $30 billion around Australia. It is far better then to provide some sort of stimulus to these areas where the housing stock exists. This would not only enhance the lives of the people living in these areas but also increase the value of one of our greatest assets: the stock of public housing. This was one of the aims of the better cities program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point of concern is that the government has not seen fit to reveal its intentions <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1156"> behind the bill. We have yet to see the Commonwealth-state housing agreement that forms part of the reforms in this bill. What, then, is the real agenda? It is certainly hoped that this bill and its move to one year of funding are not covert means of reducing government expenditure on a very important area. A cynical observer&mdash;some of whom are in the states&mdash;might see some prospect of this in the move to have the states return in 12 months time, in what is certain to still be a tight budgetary climate, to negotiate the next stage of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government, Labor had very clear aims for its housing assistance legislation. The aim was to make the outcome of the legislation match the aspirations that accompany this debate. I want to put some of those aims on the public record. Specifically, these aims were to adapt housing assistance to the structural changes in our economy. In community and nation, Labor spelt out how this was to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New policies were to be designed to achieve greater equity between people in the public and private rental markets; to improve people's ability to choose appropriate housing; and to deliver much improved private rental affordability for people on low incomes. The approach represented a fundamental reconstruction of the ways in which housing assistance is funded and delivered in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were three key elements to this policy. The first was the recognition that access to appropriate, well-located housing is a vital element of a national employment strategy. Recognising the nexus between location and employment prospects was a major determinant in the type of housing policies that we developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second element was a fundamental reform in the way financial support for housing is provided to people who are unable to afford their own homes. It was specifically to allow people on low incomes much greater choice about the size, type and location of their housing, and this could be from private, public or community providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Improved rent assistance payments were included as a means to significantly reduce <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the number of people who have to pay high proportions of their income for suitable private rental housing. This was also seen as a means of greatly reducing the number of people on waiting lists for public  housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third element was the removal of barriers to the creation of a national housing and urban development industry. When in government, Labor planned to encourage change within the industry to improve housing affordability, to provide more appropriate housing and to encourage the housing industry to become more efficient and able to look at competing successfully in overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private rental reform has been at the heart of recent developments in Labor's housing policy. The value of rent assistance payments has risen&mdash;they are very significant increases&mdash;from $163 million in 1982-83 to $1.4 billion in 1994-95. In real terms, that is an increase of 366 per cent, with a 96 per cent increase in the number of recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite these major increases, there are still major challenges to be addressed. There is the disparity between the subsidies received by people in public housing and those renting privately. There are the difficulties experienced by some low income renters&mdash;who have the financial capacity&mdash;in moving from rental to home ownership. There is the need to promote nationally consistent legislative protection for both landlords and tenants in both public and private rental tenures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that in his second reading speech the minister made reference to `the need to take a national, strategic approach to meeting the future housing needs of Australians'. I hope that is shorthand for what I am taking you through tonight. It is to be hoped that he is serious about this aim, unlike the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), whose main aim seems to be to abdicate as much of his portfolio responsibility as he can by foisting it on to the states. This, of course, is all in the name of efficiency. This is the heart of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While presenting us with what is basically the former Labor government's bill, does this government have what it takes to deliver on this long-term vision that I have outlined from the former Labor government? The fact that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1157"> I have had to move this amendment does not bode well. In fact, it bodes quite ill for the low income renters of Australia. While paying lip service to Labor's policy, they will take the first opportunity&mdash;that is, in one year's time&mdash;to cut the funding to those in housing need. I hope that we will see a commitment to the policies that Labor had pledged itself to deliver.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PG6">Ms MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I hope that we will see the provision of much greater equity between public and private renters in similar circumstances by improving the adequacy of financial support for people renting privately. These are the specific things that we would hope to see implemented. We would like to see assistance provided to those low income people where they can afford to maintain a loan into home ownership by enabling them to capitalise rent assistance payments for home purchase deposits. We would like to see public housing waiting lists reduced by improving the scope for people to choose private rental accommodation following improvements in rent assistance payments. That is a very important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would like to see job opportunities improved by opening up housing options in areas of high employment growth. We would like to see that existing tenants in public housing will not be financially disadvantaged. Finally, and most importantly, we hope that this government will live up to its pre-election policy promise that mirrored Labor's and ensure that new tenants in public housing will not need to pay more than 25 per cent of their income in rent for housing. Will this be another election commitment to be thrown out the door?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another very important plank of Labor's housing policy was directly related to the need to give low income renters the opportunity to move to areas of higher employment or employment growth. To this end, it would be necessary to put in place policies to facilitate an increase in the supply of public and community housing available for rental in these areas. To achieve this, Labor proposed that the states be able to consider alternative private or community housing suppliers and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commercial financing options if they get decent levels of private rental support. I imagine this latter point will have the approval of the present government. I certainly hope so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there are other areas of Labor policy that are equally critical that I also hope will get the government's support. I hope they will provide a high level of customer service and ensure that consumers have access to information about policies and procedures as well as their rights and responsibilities. I hope they will consult with consumers about the planning, management and delivery of services, that they will provide effective mechanisms for the investigation and resolution of complaints and that there will be specification, monitoring and reporting against service standards and guarantees. I hope to see these in the agreement when we finally get to see it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also hope that the government develops a consumer code of practice in line with agreed national principles and with consumer input. Finally, I hope that the government conducts regular consumer satisfaction surveys to obtain feedback from tenants on the quality of services which are provided. These are several of the key elements of Labor's housing assistance reform that are worth reiterating as benchmarks against the future performance of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government planned to take responsibility for housing assistance payments for low income renters in both public and private rental housing. To achieve affordable and appropriate outcomes, Labor's housing policy proposed to provide substantial increases in rent assistance and subsidies to new tenants in public housing to ensure that they paid no more than 25 per cent of their income in rent. That, too, is your policy. We hope to see it implemented. Labor's policy also proposed that existing tenants in public housing not be disadvantaged as a result of any of these reforms. Under Labor's policies the states, of course, would have retained responsibility for public housing property and tenancy management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point needs to be stressed that the previous Labor government bequeathed to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1158"> present government a housing policy that is evolving and growing with the nation's needs.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes to the nation's economy over time had created the need for a significant degree of restructuring in the industry. However, Labor's policies never ever lost sight of who they had been designed to serve&mdash;the low income renters of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the second reading of the Housing Assistance Bill 1996. Obviously the minister responsible will respond to the opposition's proposed amendment. This bill is enabling legislation which will supersede the present Commonwealth-state housing agreement and enable the states and territories to enter into a new agreement from 1 July 1996. As it is enabling legislation, the Northern Territory has no particular issue to debate, as it is intended that reform will follow in subsequent years. Naturally, the Northern Territory will continue to pursue funding reform with rigour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some urgency regarding the passage of this bill. It will allow continuing funding to the states and territories. The present Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement expires on 30 June 1996 and will be extended from 1996 to 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">State housing agreements have been negotiated with the states in 1945, 1956, 1973, 1978, 1984 and 1989. The Northern Territory was included in the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement in 1981 and, in 1989, the Australian Capital Territory became party to the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of Commonwealth funding under the CSHA is in the form of capital grants, mainly for the provision of public housing. The states and territories have a host of housing and housing related schemes that are funded by the CSHA, including schemes for public housing, community housing, loans for home purchase and rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Statistics relating to the waiting list for public housing and the number of recent <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> additions to the waiting list for public housing show that there is a substantial shortfall in the provision of public housing dwellings. For example, the number of families on waiting lists for public housing grew from 126,000 in 1982 to 232,000 in 1993&hyphen;94.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 29 November 1995, the Keating government introduced the Housing Assistance Bill 1995. That bill lapsed with the dissolution of parliament on 29 January 1996. While the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill 1996 is, for the most part, identical to the former government bill, major differences do exist. These include a new paragraph (g) contained in the preamble to the 1996 bill, which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Housing assistance will, as far as possible, offer a choice between different forms of assistance and between different providers of assistance and include the provision of targeted subsidies to home purchase aspirants.</PARA>
<PARA>A new paragraph (j) is contained in the preamble to the 1996 bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Encourage private sector involvement in the provision of appropriate and affordable housing.</PARA>
<PARA>A new subclause 11(2) is contained in the 1996 bill, which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consolidated revenue fund is appropriated for the purpose of the making of grants or other payments under this act (not exceeding, in total, $1,067,863,000) in the financial year beginning on 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said a few moments ago that their amendment would suppose that the level of funding be continued for three years. I have to add to what is being said on this side of the chamber that, if it had not been for the $8 billion black hole, the government may have been able to put in a level of triennium funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statement of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) in the second reading speech to the 1996 bill should be noted in regard to subclause 11(2). He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the next Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement will operate from 1 July 1996 and will continue to be targeted to meet the needs of people who are most at risk of housing related poverty.</PARA>
<PARA>It will be an interim agreement for up to three years aimed at achieving a number of funda <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1159"> mental reforms. As such, it will provide a basis for further significant longer term reform to achieve even greater improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of government housing assistance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS>  The agreement will be funded by a special appropriation in 1996&hyphen;97. Funding for subsequent years will be determined as part of the Commonwealth budgetary process and in the light of progress in implementing longer term reforms and the report of the National Commission of Audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 9 of the bill prohibits the minister making a grant unless the minister and state and territory ministers have agreed, in accordance with the intergovernmental housing agreement, on the amount a state and territory will spend on housing from its own financial resources. Where the minister believes, after consulting the state and territory ministers, that a state and territory will not spend all of the amount agreed to, the minister may reduce the amount payable by the Commonwealth to the state and territory and authorise payment of the unspent amount to another state or territory. Such reallocations are to be under terms and conditions determined by the minister. The new agreement, once signed by states, will be gazetted and come into effect on 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I support the bill, the territory remains unhappy with the draft agreement which had been forcibly negotiated by the previous Commonwealth government. While the present government claims that the new agreement contains significant reform, it contains enhanced opportunities for the government to intrude on issues of service and delivery of the states and territories.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through a joint submission to the National Commission of Audit, the states and territories are putting the view that the interim agreement is inconsistent with the new Commonwealth government's stated policy of reducing duplication and overlapping. As I understand it, chief executive officers of the housing authorities are meeting tomorrow to discuss both the new CSHA and the longer <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> term reforms. Hopefully, at this meeting the areas of duplication and overlap will be debated and a common point of view put to the Commonwealth that they be eliminated. Housing ministers are to meet on 24 May. Presumably their discussions will be informed by the outcomes of those other meetings. I commend the bill to honourable members. </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) in congratulating Brian Howe, the former member for Batman, on the reforms he was introducing to the public housing sector in Australia. Brian Howe was one of the outstanding members in this place&mdash;a member interested in public policy, better government and practical solutions in urban policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought those new members opposite would learn a lot by studying the career of Brian Howe because he understood that the solution to globalisation, the real answer to economic and social insecurity, is better government, not smaller government&mdash;not smaller government that forces more responsibility on to civil society which in many ways, in a globalised environment, is withdrawing from an active role in community and family. The solution is not in trying to force more responsibility on to the private sector in regional areas when those areas are already struggling with their levels of consumer demand and employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an interesting thing to hear the interjections from the government back bench. After listening to their first speeches, one can pretty well take all their speeches and put them in a bucket, take all their brain cells and put them in a smaller bucket, and there would be not one new idea emerging from that pool of thinking. It is the rhetoric of winding back the welfare state. It is the rhetoric of abolishing public housing. It is the rhetoric of pushing more responsibility on to individuals who are already disadvantaged, who are already struggling with the responsibilities and insecurity they face in a globalised economy and globalised society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those members opposite should learn from people like Brian Howe. Those members opposite, including the new member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), who is on the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1160"> extreme right wing of the Liberal Party&mdash;very typical of the redneck views the Liberal Party has brought to this parliament from the state of Queensland&mdash;should learn from the career and thinking of a fine social reformer like Brian Howe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite should learn from the sorts of reforms that are reflected in the housing package now before the House. They should learn the lasting lesson in public life that the answer is better government, not smaller government&mdash;government that makes a real contribution in levelling out the insecurity and the uncertainty of the globalised economy and the globalised society. That is the lasting lesson they should learn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms in this legislation, the Brian Howe housing package, will be long remembered in Australia as path finding. They will be long remembered in showing the way forward on the rationalisation of Commonwealth-state housing arrangements, on the rationalisation of Commonwealth-state responsibilities across the board; in showing the way forward in terms of horizontal equity in the housing market and social policy adaptability now that we have such a high level of capital mobility in our society and our economy. These are very significant reforms. These are, in fact, revolutionary in their impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those members opposite who might scoff, who presented so little by way of new thinking and new ideas in their first contributions in this House, should study these reforms long and hard and learn well from them. In fact, I would have thought just looking at horizontal equity, the first principle of the Brian Howe housing reforms, surely that is something all members in this place would be interested in: the equal treatment of public and private tenants, the establishment of universal entitlement for shelter and housing in our country, a social benchmark so that no Australian pays more than 25 per cent of their income in rent and that it is rated against capital city costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What an outstanding reform on the social democratic side of politics, as we have done for universal health insurance with Medicare, to introduce a universal entitlement in housing, one of the basic issues and necessities of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> life in a civilised society&mdash;a universal entitlement for all citizens in housing such that no Australian, no matter how much they earn, no matter where they live, no matter what their personal circumstances, no matter what their level of advantage or disadvantage, would pay more than 25 per cent of their income in rent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come to the second principle. We, of course, listen to those opposite with their barren redefinition of federal-state responsibilities. They are interested in shifting services onto the states, knowing full well that those services will be abolished. There is no concern whatsoever by this government for the proper allocation of functions&mdash;not services that cannot be funded by the states, but functions that could logically be exercised by the Commonwealth and functions which could logically be exercised by the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brian Howe has shown the way forward&mdash;a logical, rational, sensible division of responsibility between the federal government and the states in public housing such that the Commonwealth would harness its great income support, welfare and equity powers for the benefit of Australians. The states would provide the services in housing, in basic shelter, perhaps using the services of the public sector, perhaps harnessing those of the private sector, depending on the particular financial necessity&mdash;a so sensible rationalisation of federal and state responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth should be the great civilising and liberating institution in our society for welfare and equity. The states, as they have so clearly done in recent times, should adopt the role of managerial service providers. This is a model that has implications across the sweep of public policy. It has implications, for instance, in the delivery of reticulated services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know this is something that the member for Griffith (Mr McDougall), in his quite good, first contribution in the House pointed out; he has a deep interest in these issues. He would appreciate, of course, particularly in the state of Queensland, that the highest beneficiaries, the greatest beneficiaries of pricing subsidies on water and electricity are high income earners. They use more water, as a rule of thumb&mdash;and the authorities will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1161"> confirm this&mdash;than disadvantaged communities. They have more cars to wash, they have bigger gardens to water; they have a far higher consumption of water. So, if those prices are subsidised, of course, they are the greatest beneficiaries of that hidden public subsidisation on price. It is just as it is with electricity: they have more household utensils, they have a higher consumption of household electricity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been a hidden issue in federal-state relations, one that the other side, by their scoffing and scorning, of course, demonstrate they have no interest in, no conception of whatsoever. But Brian Howe has shown the way forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth's power and role in government is as the great liberator, the great welfare provider, the great equalising force in our society and the states play the role of efficient service providers. At this stage, hopefully having convinced a whole range of new members about the merits of these reforms and knowing they will be back in the morning to listen to the continuation of my remarks and to praise Brian Howe, I seek leave to continue my remarks tomorrow.</PARA>

<ELECTORATE> (Namadgi)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.36 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recently had the opportunity to visit the Caloola Farm, which is located south of Tharwa in the ACT, in the geographical, if not urban, centre of my electorate of Namadgi. Caloola Farm is a ministry of Baptist community services in the ACT and has provided assistance and support for the unemployed and the long-term unemployed over the past 15 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Programs began on the farm in the early 1980s and have expanded to centres in Tuggeranong and Woden in the ACT and over the border to Yass in New South Wales. Caloola's services have included sponsorship of the wage pause program and the communi ty youth special project and since 1989 it has been a proud sponsor of the skillshare program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the current financial year, Caloola will assist well over 1,000 long-term unemployed persons in the ACT and Yass region through skillshare and other labour market programs. Training at Caloola Farm is provided in areas such as forklift driving, horticulture and motor maintenance, while at the other centres the range of training options include office, computer and retail skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through such schemes over the years, Caloola has sought to address the training and employment needs of the most disadvantaged in the community: the very long-term unemployed; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders; persons with disabilities; young people, particularly those at risk; and persons with non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds. Specific vocational training combined with jobsearch assistance has given them the motivation and confidence to keep trying and to not lose heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without such support, these people would have been left behind in the search for employment. Programs such as skillshare have made Caloola clients and clients at other similar services competitive in the labour market and hundreds are in jobs today because of skillshare and other like programs of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a society of rapid change, skills training is an ever present requirement of those in employment and much of this training must be provided by employers. But for those out of work and who need both skills and motivation in order to find  employment, the question remains as to who will assist them to succeed. The skillshare network, of which Caloola is a part, is well placed and has considerable experience to carry this out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am increasingly concerned that the government's slash and burn budget proposals arising out of this great Costello con we are constantly hearing about will have a dramatic effect on invaluable training programs such as skillshare and the ability of organisations like Caloola Farm to continue their excellent work. I am worried that the new government is considering a reversal of the policy trends <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1162"> of previous years which has been to focus on significantly improving the employment prospects of the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we hear about proposals for women which include part-time work so that they can also carry out their family roles. What if they require retraining? Will they get it? If they do, how are they going to fit it into these amazing routines they are supposed to adopt?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Budget measures such as slashing labour market programs and amalgamating the CES with the DSS could result in unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, becoming social security recipients rather than active participants in the labour market. It is also being rumoured that programs specially designed to assist the most disadvantaged in our society are destined to be cut. There are many ways to reduce the level of unemployment and assist the unemployed to find a job. Some are more successful than others. The Caloola training centres are undoubtedly a success and a great example of a successful initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under a Labor government, Caloola was able to expand its facilities and assist more unemployed people into meaningful and worthwhile jobs because its existence was valued. I hope that it will continue to grow and provide the services so desperately needed by the people of the ACT. I think we should congratulate the people involved in places like the Caloola Training Centre for their outstanding efforts on behalf of the long-term unemployed in this region and other regions. I call for the continuation of support for labour market programs such as skillshare.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to briefly address an issue that I will be returning to on many occasions in this session of parliament. We have witnessed in the last fortnight one of the most disgraceful and most ignominious efforts in Australian diplomatic history. The Minister for Trade (Mr Fischer) went to Indonesia and pronounced that President Suharto would be regarded as one of the greatest statesmen of the late 20th century, which was a signal for the decision by the Indonesian government in the last few days to reject any negotiation with Timor. The trade minister went on to deal with another issue&mdash;an issue which has been little touched, apart from articles which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  on 24 April and 21 April. In the latter article, Michael Dwyer noted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has broken ranks with other developed countries and rejected calls from the United States and Europe for the World Trade Organisation to play a role in protecting global labour standards.</PARA>
<PARA>This country has decided that it will not hold the line with the US labour secretary. It will not hold the line with France in attempting to ensure minimum labour conditions around the world. This government believes that it is fair to have Australian workers compete with three&hyphen;year&hyphen;old children in leg chains who are packing in Bangkok. It believes that we should not do anything about it in the international arena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue was not first raised by this government. There were concerns about it under the previous government. A Treasury <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> submission on this issue last year stated, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Imposing constraints on the ability of the IFIs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>international financial institutions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to fulfil their differing roles could well reduce their effectiveness and, ultimately, prove counter-productive.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the previous government there was advice from Treasury that we should not be too active, that we should basically agree with Thailand, Indonesia and other undemocratic forces in South East Asia that labour conditions should not be dealt with in trade treaties. The fundamental result of that is the unfair competition faced by Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the efforts that are being made overseas. The publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">By the Sweat and Toil&mdash;an expose of the competition American workers face from labour</EMPHASIS> was produced by the US congress and funded by the US government. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United Nations Children's Fund in its testimony to the Department of Labor's hearings on child labor states that we are now seeing growing commitment and increased action towards the goal of eliminating exploitative child labor. Although there is no question that progress remains uneven and we obviously have a long way to go to win back childhood for the world's laboring children, it is morally unacceptable to even think of going into the 21st century with the shame of child labor still on humanity's list of unresolved social issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This second report on the exploitation of child labor, in addition to the Department of Labor's $2.1 million contribution to the ILO's IPEC program, reflects the high priority that the Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labour Affairs places on ending the shameful practice of child labour.</PARA>
<PARA>These sorts of measures have been taken not only by the Clinton administration and by the current conservative government in France, but also by Germany. Germany has funded the ILO in relation to a number of measures in Turkey, Thailand and three other nations to try to undermine the existence of these types of conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In April at a meeting of the G7 in Lille, France stated that child labour should be a matter of global trade issues. Whilst they did not win the fight there, it was agreed the OECD and the ILO would conduct a further <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1164"> study on this matter. The United States, in negotiations with Mexico and Canada on NAFTA, ensured that this matter was dealt with in the parallel treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trade minister has said to the Western world, `Yes, we are going to be part of Asia. The previous government was going in the right direction, but we are going to go even further. We are going to make sure that these people in chains, these people of 10 years of age, these people without any rights to union organisation, will be the people that the Australian labour force competes with.' That is an abject dereliction of responsibility. We will constantly return to this matter in parliament to say that the current government's retreat from it is a disgrace.  </PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to address a matter for the residents in the suburb of Murarrie in relation to a proposal to build a new BHP site. The issue of environment versus industry is having an impact on the residents of Murarrie, which is a river suburb in my electorate. Everyone in the immediate area will be affected by the proposal to construct a multimillion dollar plant on the river. As BHP plan to build a $180 million zinc and galvanised coating plant, residents and political groups are voicing their concerns. They quite rightly point to the dangers of pollution to the river and the air and, most importantly, industrial noise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dilemma which now exists is not over the first stage of the plant, which will be the coating of steel for domestic and industrial use, but over the third stage, which is a proposal for an electric arc furnace. This is not being plonked in the heart of a residential area; in fact, it fits squarely into the previous state government's already implemented gateway port strategic plan which was introduced in 1992. It was designed to connect to industry and to the Port of Brisbane, which lies at the end of the river and at the edge of the suburb of Murarrie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past 13 years the federal government has committed and has spent millions of dollars on expanding the rail service for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> freight cargo, and this now runs to the port, enabling industry to have an easy, fast and inexpensive way of moving cargo while freeing the arterial roads of heavy transport, and we all want that. The Brisbane airport is immediately opposite on the other side of the river. The gateway strategic plan was designed to allow industry to establish the areas along the river adjacent to the port and the railway line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP has taken advantage of this strategic plan and has worked closely with the city council and the state government in preparation for the plant. In between is a planned second multimillion dollar stage, which is to duplicate the first. The future success of this entire plan to contain industry in this narrow band on the southern side of the Brisbane River leading to the port rests on the smooth process of consultation and adoption of the laws covering environmental matters such as pollution and noise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt in my mind that both local and state governments can ensure that BHP rigidly adheres to the pollution measures. If it does not, then the residents of the suburb of Murarrie will have my support in leading a charge to see that these regulations are not only enforced but are seen to be enforced on an ongoing basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What can be done is to give the residents of Murarrie&mdash;who are nervous about this plant&mdash;an assurance that the third stage, that of the smelter, is not approved, certainly in its present form and certainly not at this stage. If BHP is prepared to go ahead and build the plant with the full knowledge that the third stage, the electric arc furnace, is most certainly not on the cards, then I believe we have taken the first step in an acceptable solution for both BHP and the residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an example of total commitment by local and federal governments to ensure that all&mdash;and I mean all&mdash;environmental controls are established early on, and there have to be more than just promises that the river and air will not be polluted and that noise levels will be kept to an acceptable rate. Proof must be shown to the community before the industrial plant is constructed, and this proof must be able to be inspected by the community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1165">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the BHP plant could function efficiently and would be an advantage to the area if the residents can be assured they will not be faced with an electric arc furnace as a fait accompli in years to come. They must know, and I believe they will know, that that is not going to happen, certainly not until it can be proven beyond all doubt to be not only silent but inoffensive to the environment.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, in recent weeks we have watched those opposite adopt, almost as mantra, the $8 billion deficit as a justification for a range of activities which have nothing to do with a budget or a deficit. Firstly, it is obvious that when the Senate forces the government to table the Department of Finance's costings, the $4 billion shortfall in the election promises will be seen to be the major cause of their problem. The second cause of any deficit variation will be to do with the downturn in the economy. For every percentage point of growth we talk about, there is up to $2 billion difference in bottom line budget figuring.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The fact is that the $8 billion that is talked about is not about the budget at all; it is about putting in place an ideology which has a range of implications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I saw the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) rise tonight I thought, `Aha, here is someone who is going to help. Here is a colleague on the other side who has a problem like mine.' The government is about to close the immigration office in Townsville, so people from his electorate will have to go to Brisbane to talk to an immigration officer. Similarly, the million or so people north of the Central Coast of New South Wales, who see the Newcastle immigration office as a resource, will now have to cross the Harbour Bridge to get to the office in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at Townsville and Newcastle there are a lot of similarities. Mind you, since Brisbane is closer to Canberra than Townsville is to Brisbane, I suspect that in a few years they will close the Brisbane office as well. If people from Townsville can go to Brisbane, why can't people from Brisbane go to Canberra. That is a logical extension.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought that tonight we might see some spunk and effort from those on the backbench representing Townsville and the Hunter and hear them say that these closures are not on; that the government's function is to provide services. I received a letter today from the State Director of the New South Wales state headquarters of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs which is worth reading. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The offices designated for closure are either very small with a relatively low volume of business transacted . . . or . . . with functions which can be relatively easily moved without impact on clients and where transport routes make access to neighbouring DIMA offices convenient.</PARA>
<PARA>Tell that to Townsville. The writer also refers to `alternative service provision arrangements'. Perhaps he means that the Red Cross or the Salvation Army will provide immigration functions now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen some extremely disturbing things in recent days. Tonight on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> we saw those businessmen going broke over the cancellation of DIFF. Anyone with a university anywhere near their electorate&mdash;like Newcastle and Townsville&mdash;would be concerned over the cuts to funding and what it is doing to the confidence in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To talk to my community, as I have over the last week and again today, you would think that the economy in Newcastle is coming to a dead stop. I will just go through the areas of concern: universities, cuts of $15 million, $30 million, $40 million; Working Nation, cuts of $20 million, $30 million; transfer to the states of the home and community care program, child care and health; the battle with the unions, which is about ideology, not productivity; and the cancellation of DIFF. It all means that most Australians will now wait until the budget until they make a decision about buying a house or a car or make a range of other business or investment decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone in business who makes an investment decision now is extremely unwise. That is what is coming through.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Loan Bill proposes to authorise borrowings to be undertaken and payments to be made from the loan fund to supplement the consolidated revenue fund, if necessary, to use the borrowings to pay for defence related expenditure and to pay the costs of undertaking the borrowings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the issue of defence related expenditure to which I turn initially in my remarks. I noted yesterday that the government is proposing to spend at least $360 million in relocating the Holsworthy army base near my electorate and, in its place, constructing Sydney's second international airport. I would expect that the estimate, which is some 10 years old, of $360 million worth of expenditure is, in fact, a gross underestimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members, including my colleague the member for Fowler (Mr Grace), would appreciate that in recent times the military has spent a considerable amount of funds at Holsworthy constructing a modern school of military engineering, and new warehousing and logistics facilities. My estimate, rough as it is, on that type of expenditure would be that it would cost at least a billion dollars to relocate the Holsworthy army base from south&hyphen;west Sydney. It is quite likely that loan bills would be used at some future time to raise the borrowings to meet that substantial expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I express my disappointment that these matters were not raised during the election campaign. In the substantial debate in Sydney about aircraft noise and about the future of airports there was no mention of any plan for Holsworthy and no mention of any need to relocate the army base to build Sydney's second international airport. There was a large amount of debate in Sydney about these matters. The coalition produced a substantial policy, but there was not a word, not a whisper, about their plan for Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electorate of Hughes was keenly contested. The former member, Robert Tickner, lost his seat. To my understanding, the new member for Hughes (Ms Vale) made no mention in her campaign manifesto and material of any need to allocate defence expenditure to move the Holsworthy army camp and to replace it with an international airport. I express my disappointment that just two months after the election there is a plan to this effect, and this Loan Bill will have to cover a substantial amount of defence related expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just two months after the election we find that the government has a plan to construct two 5,000 metre north&hyphen;south runways and also an east&hyphen;west runway. The plan is well summarised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of this morning. It outlines the effects, particularly with regard to noise pollution. I note with great concern on behalf of my constituents that the suburb of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1169"> Ingleburn, with some 10,000 residents, and large parts of Minto, Minto Heights and Macquarie Fields are within the 25 ANEF contour. That is, they will be severely noise affected by the construction of the east&hyphen;west runway. In fact, according to the map that has been produced in the newspaper, the east&hyphen;west runway points exactly at the suburb of Ingleburn. It is well and truly in the firing line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of great concern that none of these issues or impacts was raised during the election campaign. My opponent in the seat of Werriwa, Mr Thorn, made absolutely no mention of the Liberal Party's intention to build an east&hyphen;west runway which would point directly at the 10,000 residents of the suburb of Ingleburn. He made no mention of the fact that that runway would be without a curfew, and that there would be a 24&hyphen;hour operation of flights in and out of south&hyphen;west Sydney, with a severe impact on lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I express my disappointment because I believe in transparency. I believe in parties doing what they promise to do if they win the election. You can understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, how local members in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney are severely disappointed with the announcement yesterday. They are disappointed that an airport is to be located next&hyphen;door to the south&hyphen;west Sydney population corridor. That corridor encompasses some 500,000 residents throughout the south&hyphen;west in the arc from Bankstown to Liverpool and Campbelltown local government areas. It is looming as a lifestyle nightmare for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish it was true that on this bill the government would not require extra defence expenditure funded off loans, that in fact they could maintain the Holsworthy army camp as it has been planned, as it has been envisaged by a number of reports, as the main logistic facility for military purposes in Sydney. It should stay as a defence facility, not an airport. That, of course, would be to the lasting benefit of those 500,000 residents, particularly the families that have just moved into the suburbs of Holsworthy and Wattle Grove. They have moved in in good faith&mdash;as part of the defence housing scheme, in fact&mdash;to purchase at the lower end of the housing market in Sydney, to settle their families to enjoy a pleasant lifestyle, and now they find this extraordinary prospect of being purchased out. Their properties would need to be acquired for the construction of this airport. Again, in the metropolitan media this morning there are reports of residents saying that their reaction is to sell and move out, their lifestyle and ambitions shattered by this ill&hyphen;conceived plan announced yesterday by the Minister for Transport (Mr Sharp).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be interested to hear what Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) has got to say about this plan. It overturns the Dibb report, it overturns all the planning that his department has undertaken for many years for the future of Holsworthy and indeed the future of the national grid of defence facilities in this country. I would also be interested to hear what he has got to say about the prospect of the unexploded bombs. The Minister for Transport told the House yesterday that it is possible to defuse the bombs, but I raise the prospect that it is probably not possible to find them. They do not bounce across the artillery range like golf balls on a golf practice range; they implode into the ground. They are grown over, covered with vegetation. There are literally thousands, if not tens of thousands, of unexploded bombs on that army range, and to find them is hard enough, let alone to defuse them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that, we know that the terrain is treacherous. It is covered with ravines and gorges that lead into the Georges River. While it is true that the Badgerys Creek airport site is not like a billiard table, is not completely flat, it is relatively flat, supremely flat, compared with the Holsworthy site which is now under active consideration.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1170">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would plead with the government on this Loan Bill to reconsider this unnecessary defence related expenditure of at least a billion dollars to relocate the army out of Holsworthy. I plead on behalf of constituents of mine in the suburbs of Glenfield, Macquarie Fields, Ingleburn, right throughout the Campbelltown corridor; on behalf of all those people who have moved into the suburbs of Casula and Churchill Gardens and related areas; and of those in the new release suburb of Prestons, which is in my electorate. They will all be affected by this east&hyphen;west runway which points directly at them and by the sweep of aircraft which will affect their families and their lifestyle. I would ask the government on this matter to reconsider the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no need to proceed with an environmental study. It will merely confirm the findings of the report 10 years ago. In fact, I would expect things have got worse in terms of population growth around Holsworthy. We have seen the new suburb of Wattle Grove. We have seen the redevelopment and population explosion of Holsworthy itself. We have seen the development of housing estates in Casula and throughout Campbelltown. I suspect there has been some medium density infill development to the north of the airport throughout the Bankstown local government area. So, if the reports 10 years ago said that too many people lived too close to the Holsworthy site, that has probably been multiplied now with 30,000 extra residents moving in over the last 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these things are well known to the locals and I wish there had been some consultation where the Minister for Transport could have spoken to the local communities, councils, environmentalists and community activists to get their feeling before he announced this plan, a plan that has already upset so many people. It really is a tragedy to see families in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney who have established themselves in good faith now leading a stampede to get out because they weren't told about these things prior to the election and they weren't consulted after the election. It is a very sad day for people in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to that 1985 report about aircraft needs in Sydney. There was an assessment made of Holsworthy. It pointed to the large and growing cost of relocating the military facilities and it ranked Holsworthy ninth out of 10 options. It classified it as a site with severe liabilities. One of those was the problem of the unexploded bombs. Another was the issue of the ravines and gorges, which would lead to huge landfill costs for the projects. The site preparation and the army relocation at that time were estimated at a combined cost of $800 million. That would since have blown sky&hyphen;high because of the additional cost of residential acquisition and the additional facilities that the army has built at Holsworthy in the last 10 years that would now have to be relocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So not only would there be the waste of public money in building the facilities and having them moved, but there would be substantial public cost in acquiring sites in other parts of Australia to which they could be moved. This is not good planning; it is not good transport planning; it is not good urban planning, and it is not good lifestyle planning. I think that the advice the Minister for Defence will be getting from his officials is that it is not good defence planning. It is not good for the defence needs and logistical requirements of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I ask the government to reconsider these things and to note that so many residents&mdash;I would estimate at least 10,000 residents just in my electorate&mdash;would be within the 25 ANEF corridor. They are going to find a lifestyle similar to that which has been experienced in the suburb of Marrickville just north of the new third runway at Sydney airport. Those sorts of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1171"> things should not occur without substantial planning and consultation. That has been the lesson at Mascot. Let us not revisit those mistakes in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney. There has been substantial population growth and those residents face a whole series of problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just quote the 1985 airport assessment on Holsworthy. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Holsworthy has severe weaknesses in terms of airport operations and cost, and its ranking on environmental factors is mixed when compared with the sites in the closer group . . . The use of Holsworthy would create irreconcilable airspace conflict with aircraft movements at Bankstown Airport.</PARA>
<PARA>So out of this there are not only the costs of moving the army and building an airport, but of having to close Bankstown airport. Where is it to go in the Sydney basin when the area is already at capacity? The major general aviation and light aircraft movement airport in Sydney is to be closed and relocated; a new site purchased, and a new airport built. It is snowballing into a fiscal nightmare for this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assessment report in 1985 went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this extent, selection of the Holsworthy site as a second Sydney airport could be seen to be in conflict with the basic objective of the Second Sydney Airport Site Selection Programme&mdash;to increase runway capacity in the Sydney region.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no need to proceed with Holsworthy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The report mentioned that this site had severe liabilities. Let me quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the analysis of the characteristics of the 10 sites, three sites displayed one or more severe disadvantages in comparison to the other sites. These three sites were Darkes Forest, Goulburn and Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA>This was not treated 10 years ago as a serious proposition. Why would it be resurrected by the government now when the circumstances have grown much worse in terms of public impact and public cost? There would be public impact on nearly 500,000 residents throughout the south&hyphen;west Sydney corridor, and the public cost of the extra army expenditure at Holsworthy in the last decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the ranking of potential sites, Holsworthy came second last. Badgerys Creek was ahead of it, as were Wilton, Bringelly, Londonderry, Scheyville, Warnervale, Somersby and Darkes Forest. The only one that Holsworthy could beat home was Goulburn, and no&hyphen;one treats Goulburn as a serious proposition, given its huge distance from the Sydney basin. So you have Holsworthy among the Sydney basin options ranking last, and only getting ahead of Goulburn by virtue of that centre's supreme disadvantage on distance. This is not a proposition which any sensible, caring and fiscally responsible government would entertain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat my call on behalf of those 500,000 residents. I know that I am joined by the member for Fowler, the Labor candidate for the seat of Blaxland, naturally enough, and the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). I hope that I am joined by the Liberal Party member for Hughes in saying that this is an ill&hyphen;conceived, ill thought out announcement by the government and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope and in fact I ask the honourable member for Hughes through this debate to join us in saying that it should not go ahead. The interests in south&hyphen;west Sydney are more important, on such a basic lifestyle question, than are party politics. She has been elected without a mandate for this project. She would know that every single resident in east Liverpool, from Moorebank, Chipping Norton, Hammondville, Holsworthy and Wattle Grove, would be dead&hyphen;set opposed to this idea of an international airport on their doorstep. She should join with us in saying that it is a bad idea, and use her lobbying capacity within the federal government to change the mind of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1172">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that issue, on this legislation, I note that the bill seeks to finance the 1996&hyphen;97 budget and, as such, it is directly relevant to the fiscal position of the Commonwealth in speculation about the underlying fiscal deficit for 1996&hyphen;97. In this regard, talk of a budget black hole is simply an attempt by the coalition to construct an alibi, to manufacture a crisis for party political reasons. They are seeking to construct an alibi to manufacture a crisis on this issue for two basic reasons. First, they wish to break the promises that they had no intention of keeping. The coalition made promises at the last campaign that were made only to be broken and now they seek a reason, an alibi, to manufacture a crisis by which the breach of those promises might be judged acceptable to the Australian public. It reflects on a basic contradiction in the philosophy and political intent of the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that the things that the conservative side of politics in Australia believes in are called Fightback. That was clear at the 1993 election. Dr Hewson thought he could not lose it so he put forward the things that his side of politics strongly believed in and they were called Fightback. But of course Fightback was not acceptable to the Australian people. So, for the 1996 election, for a narrow cynical electoral reason, the coalition put forward different policies&mdash;policies that they do not really believe in, and policies that they wish to junk now that they have won the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often said that, and I think it is true, the coalition won the last election on the basis of Labor strategies. They adopted all the Labor policies. It was quite remarkable that even on Medicare they were advertising&mdash;as if it was their own initiative&mdash;that Medicare was going to be maintained and that bulk&hyphen;billing would be maintained. The coalition needed to find an alibi. They needed to manufacture a crisis and that is the political use to which they are putting this bogus argument about a black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also reflects, of course, that the coalition have no answers of their own. Smaller government has been tried in various parts of the world and it has failed. The only answer is better government. Winding back the welfare state is not a legitimate response to questions of economic and social insecurity arising out of globalisation. In other parts of the world they have tried the competitive advantage paradigm. All the micro&hyphen;reform and competition policy under the sun will not produce full employment in Australia. There are structural imbalances in the labour market and in the regions of the nation that necessitate an active role for government on both the supply and demand side of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw in Australia, in the late 1980s, the use of the twin deficits theory; the belief that a lower federal deficit produces a reduction in the current account deficit. It did not hold true. It did not hold true in the late 1980s and it is unlikely to hold true in the mid&hyphen;1990s now that it is being tried by Treasurer Costello. We have seen in other parts of the world, indeed some of the state governments in Australia, a supply side fetish&mdash;that is, blind to one side of the economy, the demand side, and focussing only on the supply side. Again, that is a basic imbalance in the way in which good reformers, good policy makers would run an internationalised economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So with all these areas&mdash;smaller government, winding back the welfare state, the twin deficits theory, the competitive advantage paradigm and the supply side fetish&mdash;the policies are not only wrong but they have been tried elsewhere and have been shown to have failed. The policy is not only wrong in theory but in practice. Other parts of the world, and some parts of Australia, have tried these remedies and they have failed, failed fundamentally. I would urge the coalition not to carry on with talk of a budget black hole but to construct <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1173"> answers to relevant issues, to questions of globalisation, economic insecurity and social insecurity, and not to fall back on things that have been tried in the United Kingdom, the United States and Western Europe over the last 10 years and have basically failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The allegation of a black hole is a weak alibi. In fact, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) gave himself away when he put his hands up and confessed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 12 May. Laurie Oakes asked him this basic question: `If Treasury revises growth forecasts again, will you change your $8 billion target in the budget?' This is what the Treasurer had to say: `Yes, I just wanted to make that point, the black hole was the non&hyphen;disclosure.' A non&hyphen;disclosure, that was the point. What can we tell from this stunning confession? We can tell two things. If Treasury changes its forecast, the allegation dissolves. If they revise their growth forecast upwards, the Treasurer no longer has an $8 billion target. He was asked that and he said yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they change their figures, if the economy is forecast to grow stronger and there is a flow&hyphen;on positive impact on the budget, his $8 billion target dissolves. He said he would change the target. If he changes the target, the allegation dissolves. It just makes the point that this is a forecasting exercise. The coalition is not talking about things that are happening in May 1996. None of these budget issues are happening now. They are forecasts about what may or may not happen in the fiscal framework, the fiscal outcomes between July 1996 and June 1997. It is a forecasting exercise. They are not talking about present circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only need to read the detail of the Treasurer's press release on 12 March to appreciate that. This is what it said in the detail and the truth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . nevertheless, the database for 1996&hyphen;97 estimates is entirely forecast and hence subject to substantial revision.</PARA>
<PARA>So he not only gave himself away on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS>  program, but in the detail of his own press release he is saying that the estimates are entirely projected and hence subject to substantial revision. The best summary of this was made by BZW, the merchant bankers, in their bulletin on 22 March. This is what they had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everything to do with budget numbers is slightly suspect so beware of some tricks. Most of the deterioration in the budget outlook reflects changed economic assumptions. The headline budget balance for 1996&hyphen;97 was revised from a $3.4 billion surplus to a $4.9 billion deficit but only $446 million of this was accounted for by policy decisions. In other words, most of the problem could disappear as quickly as it appeared if the economic forecasts are revised.</PARA>
<PARA>Don't just take my word on that question of the accuracy of forecasts. Take no less an authority than the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). This is what he had to say in the April 1984 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS>  magazine:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem with long&hyphen;term projections is that very often they turn out to be incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA>How true! The long&hyphen;term projections about what might happen in the fiscal outcomes up to July 1997 could turn out to be incorrect. So there he is&mdash;damned, exposed. He has blown his alibi with his own words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that if the economy grows, or if it is forecast to grow, by just half a per cent of GDP, there is an impact&mdash;a fiscal bonus&mdash;of nearly a billion dollars from that change in forecasting. And, indeed, the policy changes of the former government account for less than half a billion dollars of this alleged $8 billion black hole. Less than one&hyphen;sixteenth of the allegation actually relates to policy changes. The entire remainder of the allegation relates to parameter changes in the forecast&mdash;and we know how quickly economic circumstances change <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1174"> in an open economy. From day to day, week to week, month to month, these circumstances change and the Treasury takes account of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer wants us to believe that after he was elected on 2 March within 48 hours he had a new set of forecasts and that on 4 March the world had changed. That is when he found out about the new budget figures and the new growth forecasts that were producing 90 per cent of the fiscal parameter changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an instance just recently of how the government's own policy is changing the parameters. The mere act of contracting the budget knocks half a per cent off GDP. Knocking half a per cent of growth off the economy has the impact of blowing out government outlays and tightening revenue. It is like a dog chasing its own tail: they are contracting the economy, which reduces the forecasts for growth in 1996&hyphen;97, and they need to respond to that by tightening their fiscal policy even further. This is the Keynesian framework of a dog chasing its own tail. It just underlines the point that this is a forecasting exercise, unrelated to what is happening now and in the past. Less than one&hyphen;sixteenth of this allegation relates to actual policy changes and spending decisions of the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing we can tell from that confession by the Treasurer on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program is that, in his opinion, `it is an issue of non&hyphen;disclosure', that is, it is not an issue of fiscal legacy, it is about the disclosure. It is a problem of not what he found when he became Treasurer but when he found it. It is not a fiscal issue related to the actual dimension of the budget but it is a non&hyphen;disclosure issue: it is not the substance of what he found on 4 March but the fact that he found it after the election. That seems to be what he regards as the essence of the so&hyphen;called black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this reveals the Treasurer of Australia as the Gomer Pyle of Australian politics. He has walked into the Treasurer's office and it is surprise, surprise, surprise: the economy has slowed and the fiscal position has weakened. Why should he be saying surprise, surprise, surprise when for 18 months every public and private forecaster in the nation has been saying that growth was slowing and that would have a weakening effect on the Commonwealth budget?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we all remember the member for Bennelong, then the Leader of the Opposition, during the election campaign talking about the prospect of a negative growth quarter for December 1995. When the figures were announced, he was saying, `This could be a negative growth quarter'. The Prime Minister, who was then the Leader of the Opposition, was acknowledging that the economy was slowing. In fact, the Treasurer said it himself in November when Access Economics&mdash;his shadow Treasury&mdash;had given him advice that the economy was slowing to a point where the budget would be substantially weakened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, we had Two Neurone Tim, the Deputy Prime Minister, saying that the fiscal position had weakened. We had Jeff Kennett, the Premier of Victoria, blowing the whistle&mdash;at a very inopportune time in the federal campaign&mdash;on what was likely to be the budgetary position. That, of course, exposes the reality that there has been no black hole. There has been no fiscal irresponsibility. There has been simply a change in forecasting and a change in parameters. There has been nothing unusual or improper about the way in which the former government disclosed material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, as I have noted previously, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, was doing the disclosing at one stage at the end of last year. The Prime Minister was doing the disclosing then, but&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;when he walked into the Treasurer's office on 4 March he knew none of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1175"> this. He knew nothing about the economy slowing and having a weakening impact on the Commonwealth budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government was in fact a successful model in disclosure and in transparent budgeting. Before Labor, in the Treasurer Howard era, there were no out&hyphen;year forward estimates. The parliamentary secretary knows that. There were no estimates projecting forward. We introduced them as an act of transparency and fiscal disclosure. Before the election of the Labor government, there was no mid&hyphen;year review. Before the election of the Labor government and back in the Howard era, part one, there was no fiscal framework. All you got under Treasurer Howard was a budget that told you in August about things that would happen in the economy&mdash;outlays and revenue&mdash;up to 30 June of the following year. You got no forward estimates, no mid&hyphen;year review, no update on what then happened, and no fiscal framework by which the public can understand the basis of budget making in the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what really gives the government's alibi away is this, and we have seen it all before. It is so old hat. The public would be very surprised if a new government were elected and did not say the cupboards were bare. We first saw it in New South Wales, with the election of the Greiner government in 1988. What Greiner's senior adviser, his chief of staff, Gary Sturgess, had to say about that particular period of allegations and budget forecasting for the New South Wales parliament was that it was a `marketing exercise'. He said, `In March 1988 there was no great feeling that New South Wales finances were in drastic shape. So why would you need a government shake&hyphen;up? It was a marketing exercise.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those words apply, chapter and verse, to the Commonwealth in 1996. The public knows that there has been no great feeling of the Commonwealth finances being in drastic shape, and there is no need for a government shake&hyphen;up. So the new government has tried to manufacture an alibi and a sense of crisis, and they are using a script written by Nick Greiner in 1988 and repeated by Jeff Kennett when he was elected. It was a script that was repeated&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no need for a government shake&hyphen;up. It is purely an attempt by the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government to manufacture a crisis to establish for themselves an alibi which, effectively, they have blown already.

They talk about disclosure and transparency, but they will not tell the people or the parliament of Australia what Finance has told them about their rubbery figures from the election campaign: the $1.2 billion hole that Finance found before the election, or the $3 billion promises and cuts that were too vague to be costed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that the government has a $4 billion hole of its own making: a $4 billion hole of its own fiscal irresponsibility leading up to the election. It has blown its alibi; the Treasurer is not up to the job.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He talked about `unexploded bombs' which is pretty relevant to the rest of his speech. He said that we, the government, have no intention of keeping our promises. I was elected in 1993, prior to the member for Werriwa coming to the parliament, and, frankly, for the Labor Party to talk about not keeping promises is an absolute joke. He talked about Medicare and said that we are going to break some promises on Medicare. Wrong! I do not know of any marginal seat member on our side of politics who is going to change Medicare. The member for Werriwa fails to talk about the former health minister, who said she would not increase the Medicare levy but, 12 months later, did that. He says our policies are wrong and in theory, he says, they are not working elsewhere. I have to tell him that the policies of his party did not successfully work for his party either because now it is in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said, `Beware of the tricks'. I do not know what tricks he talks about. Perhaps he should be talking about tricks of the Labor Party in the 1993 election when it promised not to raise tax and then did so. He talks about 1982; 1982 is 14 years ago. The member must have still been at university in 1982. A lot of things have happened in the world since 1982: the Berlin wall has collapsed; communism has collapsed; a lot of things have changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa talked about the transparency of his policies. That is true. They were transparent because you could see straight through them and you came up against this great big wall of debt that the Labor Party has left. It has no responsibility at all in how to spend money and the public knows this. He said the public knows all about the coalition parties and that people will see through them. The public does know: on March 2 they voted comprehensively all over Australia to change governments and they are going to give the coalition government maybe three years.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1177">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we did find was a forecasted deficit&mdash;forecasted deficit, let me repeat it so it goes through your head&mdash;of $8 billion. The then Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) would have liked us to believe that the budget was in a surplus of about $718 million. I guess that is one of the tricks. It is no wonder that the Australian people so decisively turned their backs on the Labor Party and said they were sick of Labor economic mismanagement. That is what happened on 2 March. It happened not only on 2 March; it also happened in Western Australia, it happened in South Australia, it happened in Victoria, and it happened in Queensland. All the states with financial problems were led back into some sort of financial wellbeing by Liberal Party governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the privatisation programs which some of the states are pursuing are using the proceeds to retire debt. The states do not use the proceeds for recurrent expenditure as the former Labor government did, as was just confirmed by the member for Werriwa. What he would like to do is to spend the assets without paying off the debt. Retiring debt lowers the cost of servicing the debt. The Labor Party just does not understand. If debt is retired, the cost of servicing debt is reduced, and that in turn contributes to the attainment of an even better fiscal outcome.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If he wants to talk about Western Australia, I will talk about Western Australia. My state of Western Australia expects to have a balanced budget. I know that is hard for some of my Labor colleagues to understand, but it has actually been achieved. The coalition government in Western Australia has achieved a reduction in public sector net debt which is expected to fall by $927 million in 1995&hyphen;96 to $6.6 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the lowest level of net debt since 1989 in Western Australia. No wonder we are forging ahead in Western Australia. Recognising these achievements, Standard and Poor's rating agency has placed Western Australia on a positive credit rating watch for an upgrade to AAA. Western Australia's ratio of net debt to gross product will be similar to that of New South Wales by 30 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the position in the state of Western Australia in comparison to that under the former Labor federal government. In its 13 years in office, the former federal Labor government achieved a massive spending increase of 44 per cent, a forecast budget deficit of $8 billion, a huge foreign debt of more than $100 billion, and a public debt interest outlay estimated to be over $10 billion in 1996&hyphen;97&mdash;$10 billion in debt interest in one year. What a report card that is!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party went to the people of Australia on 2 March and what was the score? It was zero on economics&mdash;that was the vote. Members of the Labor Party still have not quite come to terms with those issues. I am glad of that, because if they keep thinking they are in government then we are going to be in government for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is normal in good economic times for businesses and households to retire debt, but Labor did the opposite. It kept racking up debt in the good times. Even when growth was strong and employment was expanding, the former government kept spending and kept increasing Australia's debt. Under Labor, the quick fix solution&mdash;one of those tricky little things&mdash;was to raise taxes to finance the deficit. In 1993 they went to the election saying, `We're not going to raise taxes.' And did they? Of course they did. They did it for the wholesale sales tax system. They said they would not increase those taxes and then they did. They promised at <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1178"> election time that they would not raise taxes, and as soon as the election was over, up they went.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, who has been forgotten by many within this parliament, promised not to raise taxes to win government in the 1993 election. He thought he could achieve this objective and then snatch them all back again. Those broken promises revealed the Labor government's contempt for the Australian people. However, the former Prime Minister was fairly judged at the recent election, and the current opposition should know that the Australian people will not be fooled again by deceit and untruths. They will not wear untruths anymore from the Labor Party. Never again will they wear untruths.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Programs are missing out because of Labor's economic mismanagement over the last 13 years. What it comes down to is that the previous Labor government, like all Labor governments, cannot manage money. They have no idea how to raise money&mdash;except for taxes. They have no idea how to create wealth; they like spending it, but they have no idea where it comes from. There are limits to what you can raise initially from taxation because you keep taxing people out of existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of debt management is a high priority in the electorate. Take, for example, a household budget. There would be a lot of people&mdash;and I am sure there would be in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1179"> member for Werriwa's electorate&mdash;who are struggling at the moment, probably earning about $500 a week. Anyone would know that if you spent $480 of that $500 a week you would have $20 left over and you could probably save it. But if you spend $540, you are $40 overspent. Therefore you either have to reduce your spending by $40 or increase your income to cover it. You do not go and borrow the money to pay for the groceries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is basically what the Labor Party does in government, whether it is in state or federal government. They do not want to look at their expenditure. They do not even know how to increase their income. All they want to do is borrow to cover the extra spending. If we use the former Labor government as an example of balancing the books, we see that Labor has failed dismally when it comes to limiting its spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the biggest issues in the electorate which relates to this particular loan bill is how the government plans to handle its spending. The Labor Party has no idea how to handle financial accounts, especially our savings and our current account. Labor's solution was to abandon higher growth and the unemployed, and to try to get imports down simply by slowing growth in demand. For the edification of the members opposite, low growth means low employment opportunities, so we are on the roller&hyphen;coaster yet again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the Labor government had to put the brakes on was that they did not have the courage to make some hard decisions about cutting spending and lifting savings. That can be done in Australia. One simply has to look no further than the Liberal state governments to see the positive results of those governments. We must get our debt under control, otherwise we will leave to our children a very terrible legacy.</PARA>

The tricky party would rather tell you that Australian unemployment is getting better when, over the 13 years Labor was in office, it got considerably worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people told the Labor Party on 2 March something that that party has not quite come to terms with yet. They told the Labor Party what it did not want to hear&mdash;the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1180"> truth: it is time to finish the policies that you have been giving us for the last 13 years and it is time to try something different.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have already heard criticism, Mr Deputy Speaker, from the opposition on how bad the government is in reducing its spending. It is criticism of some of the tough decisions we are about to make that they did not have the courage to tackle.

There could be more child centres, more health facilities and more help for our indigenous people. The Labor Party just does not come to terms with these things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many programs that $10 billion a year can be put towards. It was obvious to me that the Labor Party during its time in government did not share this attitude, and they continued to rack up the debt. Remember that we have been left with what has been commonly called Beazley's $8 billion forecasted budget deficit black hole. Despite the obstructionist actions of Labor and the Democrats, we will deal with the deficit responsibly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the distortions that the opposition has put before us recently with regard to economic management. On our spending cuts, the opposition claims that the coalition is slashing many Public Service jobs. Only last week we saw in front of this House many public servants protesting against the government job cuts. But let us look at some of the facts. The Department of Finance calculations say that something like 13,000 Commonwealth public servants would have been made redundant in the 24 months to June of this year. The great bulk of those redundancies would have been a consequence of the actions of the former Labor government. Did we see the Community and Public Sector Union taking major industrial action because of Labor's decision to make 13,000 people redundant in the past two years? Did the honourable member for Werriwa stand up and say, `No; we should not be doing this, Paul. Come on; we cannot be cutting the Public Service.'  The answer is no; we did not hear them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where are the unions' priorities to their members in trying to reduce debt so that we can all be better off by not paying our huge interest bill? I agree with the Prime Minister's comments last week when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">If you are going to have a situation where redundancies carried out by a government with which you are politically affiliated are accepted, yet those which occur under a government with which you are not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1181"> politically affiliated are subjected to industrial action, you can expect the rest of the community to have a lot of interest in your credibility.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In other words, we have to ask the public sector union just exactly where their priorities lie.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government does not show leadership on the issues of financial management, how can we expect the private sector to do the same? Let us look at some of the options that the government is taking to reduce this particular debt. The benefits of the sale of Telstra will be enormous. Not only will the environment get a fair go with the most comprehensive environmental package ever produced but also the sale will be used to retire debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is expected that the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra will raise approximately $8 billion: $1 billion of this will be used to fund the National Heritage Trust; the remaining $7 billion will be used to retire Commonwealth debt, which stands at over $100 billion. This will reduce the burden of interest payments on Commonwealth debt, opening up funding for the provision of services while taking pressure off interest rates. This means that small business will be able to get back into business, thus creating jobs for our future&mdash;for our children&mdash;and no&hyphen;one in this place would disagree with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, these benefits can only be delivered if the legislation to allow the partial sale of Telstra is allowed to pass through the Senate. The ALP and the Democrats have stated their opposition to the partial sale and have signalled that they intend to obstruct the government's legislation in the Senate despite the overwhelming support of the Australian public at the recent election. This obstructionism would deny Australians all the benefits they were promised during the election. One of those benefits was to reduce debt and give the people of Australia sound economic management. The Democrats ought to keep this in mind when they come to vote on that particular legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Loan Bill will facilitate the borrowings to top up the consolidated revenue fund. After 13 years of Labor's economic management&mdash;some people say mismanagement&mdash;the task ahead for the coalition is enormous. But we have the courage and the honesty to treat the Australian people with respect and to let them know the true financial status of this country. We will be judged on our record. In three years, the Australian people will let us know whether the coalition parties have been good economic managers&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank all honourable members for their contributions to this debate. The Loan Bill 1996 is basically a machinery financing measure which makes provision for the financing of the prospective deficit from the consolidated revenue fund. This bill facilitates the balancing of the CRF by authorising certain defence expenditures to be met from the loan fund rather than the CRF, and the supplementation by the loan fund of the moneys available to the CRF. The bill also provides the authority to raise loans to cover these payments from the loan fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reflecting the routine nature of the bill, there has, on this occasion, been only a limited number of speakers. Nevertheless, it has been an opportunity for honourable members to put forward their views about the state of the economy, with particular emphasis on the level of public sector indebtedness and the aggregate level of Australia's overseas indebtedness, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1182"> there has been a focus upon the particular interests of individual members. Honourable members participating in the debate have availed themselves of that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank honourable members for the manner in which they have conducted themselves in this debate. Nevertheless, I should reiterate that, except for a small amount of loan raising expenses, the bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already approved by, or before, the parliament. As such, the bill does not in any way impinge upon the prerogative of the parliament to appropriate moneys. It simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the parliament. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill is identical to that which was presented by the former government and passed by the House on 24 October 1995. That bill lapsed in the Senate due to the election. The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was established over 30 years ago to overcome a structural deficiency in the highly regulated financial system. Its main purpose was to assist low income earners with small deposits to obtain housing finance. It did this by insuring lenders against the cost of mortgage defaults. Since then, other insurers have entered the mortgage insurance market, thereby reducing the necessity to maintain the corporation in public ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, the former government decided to transfer the corporation to the private sector. The transfer process itself has been difficult due to the lack of competitive neutrality of the regulations under which the corporation has operated. The corporation's liabilities are guaranteed by the Commonwealth, giving it an advantage over the other participants in the market. In addition, the corporation was exempt from supervision by the industry regulator, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Consequently, it did not have to comply with the capital adequacy arrangements applying to its competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To overcome these problems, the former government decided to abandon the privatisation option but to restructure the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation along the following lines. Firstly, the corporation will be re&hyphen;established as a company incorporated under the companies law and subject to the regulations of the ISC, as well as those of the states and territories. The new company will be fully capitalised in line with the requirements of the ISC, drawing on part of the present capital and reserves. The Commonwealth guarantee on borrowings for the new company will be removed. However, traditional arrangements will be implemented to allay uncertainty arising from the restructuring and to ensure that the new company attains the appropriate credit rating required by state legislation without the need for further capital injections. The corporation will cease writing business on the day before the new company comes into existence. The then existing insurance policies, the so&hyphen;called old book, will be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1183"> directly taken over by the Commonwealth and the balance of the corporation's capital and reserves in excess of $100 million will be paid to consolidated revenue. Finally, the Commonwealth will then contract with the new company to administer the old book insurance obligations, with the Commonwealth making any payments arising from this old business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These arrangements will considerably improve the competitive neutrality of the mortgage insurance market, continuing the strong record of the former government in achievements in the competition policy area. To achieve this restructuring, the bill proposes to allow the Treasurer to transfer the assets and liabilities of the corporation and to enter into any agreement with the new company to make provision for the payment of claims that may arise. The transfer of staff from the corporation to the new company will be achieved with the maintenance of the existing conditions and entitlements such as leave entitlements, superannuation and workers compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the bill proposes the winding&hyphen;up of the corporation and the repeal of now redundant legislation associated with the corporation. The bill, by my assessment, represents good policy which simultaneously improves the competitive neutrality in the mortgage insurance market, in itself an important reform, and improves Commonwealth finances by around $100 million. It maintains the conditions and entitlements of staff, thereby guaranteeing industrial harmony during the industry restructuring process, and lessens the contingent liabilities of the Commonwealth into the future&mdash;another good, shining example of the sound financial management of the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill represents good economic management. Labor is proud of what it achieved in government across the board. We introduced this legislation and, naturally enough, we find no reason to oppose it at this point of the parliamentary cycle.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) pointed out in his remarks on the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1996, this was a piece of legislation which was introduced by the previous government in the previous parliament and was not opposed when the bill passed through the House of Representatives on that occasion by the then opposition, now government. Accordingly, the bill has been reintroduced, and one would expect that the opposition would not oppose it on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was established in 1965 to insure lenders against losses arising out of the making of loans for housing. The original bill authorised the corporation to put into effect the then government's promised housing loans insurance scheme and empowered the corporation to insure loans made for the erection of homes, the purchase of existing homes, additions to homes, the repair and improvement of homes and the discharge and refinancing of existing mortgages on homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main purpose of that scheme, which is now 30 years in duration, was to assist people to obtain as a single loan and at a reasonable rate of interest the money they needed and could afford to borrow to buy or build a home. As the amount borrowed may at times have been a high proportion of the value of a house and land, there was a risk that the lender might lose some of the capital and might not receive all the interest due. The offer by the corporation to insure against the risk of loss due to failure to recover the amount outstanding on the loan, together with accrued interest, enabled lenders to protect themselves against such losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the then Minister for Housing, Mr Bury, said when introducing the legislation and the scheme: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1184">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme aims to assist people to borrow, by means of a single loan secured by a first mortgage, the difference between available personal savings and the cost of a home suited to their requirements. The amount of the loan would, of course, be related to the ability of the borrower to repay it over a reasonable period. It is our hope and intention that this scheme will progressively remove the present need for many creditworthy borrowers to obtain a second mortgage loan, frequently on oppressive terms and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that this scheme, which was introduced by the Menzies government in 1965, was one which was aimed, at the time, at improving the opportunity for home ownership of ordinary Australians. Many working&hyphen;class and middle&hyphen;class Australians who would have had difficulty in raising finance in those years without having to obtain a second mortgage, were able to afford homes as a consequence of this scheme, which has worked successfully since its introduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the issue of the affordability of homes that I want to address briefly today. It is also clear that the corporation has been successful. In fact, it became a clear leader in the mortgage insurance market and it is responsible for close to half the estimated $130 million in premiums written each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading speech when this bill was introduced by the former government last year, the then Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, said that prevailing conditions in the mortgage, insurance and finance industries now differed considerably from those when the corporation was set up in the mid&hyphen;1960s. In the home market, the number of people falling behind in their payments over the last few months of 1995 has leapt by some 37 per cent. Over the period of most of 1995 the number of home repossessions in Australia actually increased by 20 per cent&mdash;a situation which is very relevant to the terms of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look back on the original bills and the debates that occurred in 1965 when this bill was introduced. It may be of interest to the current member for Werriwa that one of his predecessors, Mr Gough Whitlam&mdash;later to become Prime Minister&mdash;made reference to housing affordability when this bill was introduced. In his speech he said that if a person wished to buy a house for &pound;5,000, which he indicated was the average price for a house and land then, it would have required a weekly income in those days of &pound;31 to be able to afford that house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one then compares housing affordability between 1975 and 1995 and looks at the report of the Urban Development Council, a report which was endorsed last year by the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, then there are figures in there that relate to the affordability of housing in this country. For example, that document says that in 1975 the median price for a first home in Australia was $25,500. In order to be able to meet a loan on the median house priced at $25,500 in 1975, an annual income of $9,955 was required. That was calculated taking an interest rate of 10 per cent over a 25&hyphen;year loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one goes forward 20 years to 1995, then the median price for a first home was $137,900: an increase from $25,500 in 1975 to $137,900 in 1995. In 1975, to meet the repayments on such a loan required an annual income of $9,955. By 1995, in order to meet the repayments on a median home in Australia&mdash;we are not talking about something at the top end of housing affordability in this country&mdash;according to the council an annual income of $60,184 was required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one considers the average level of income in this country, then it is far below $60,184. In addition, there are all the other living expenses that are involved in maintaining a house and family.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1185">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have seen over the 20&hyphen;year period from 1975 to 1995 is this huge increase in the amount which a person or family requires in order to be able to make the repayments on a median priced house in this country&mdash;namely, from an amount of $9,955 in 1975, to $60,184 in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The huge increase in those figures is borne out in a number of factors which I will come to, and which, I believe, ought to be of concern to all honourable members and senators in this parliament. Indeed, it ought to be of concern to all the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, we are told by the Housing Industry Association that it expects a continuation of a slowdown in housing over the remainder of this decade. The association predicts, for example, that spending on new dwellings will fall from an annual average of $13.6 billion in 1990&hyphen;1995, to $11.1 billion between 1995 and the year 2000. And if one then looks in terms of what is happening with household incomes, one can see that there are huge changes occurring in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the business commentator, Phil Ruthven, has pointed out recently that the proportion of households with incomes of more than $72,000 had risen from 15 per cent in 1976 to 30 per cent in 1992. There has been a doubling of the proportion of those households with incomes in excess of $72,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, the proportion of households with an annual income below $22,000 had also increased from 20 per cent in 1976 to 30 per cent in 1992. So we have an increase in the number of households in Australia at the top end, with an annual income of over $72,000&mdash;in fact a doubling of the proportion. We also have an increase at the bottom end, where the household annual income is less than $22,000, an increase from 20 to 30 per cent of households. And of course, as commonsense and the ordinary experience of Australians indicate, for those in the middle there has been a continuing squeeze over the last 20 years. Whereas previously, there were 65 per cent of households in this middle&hyphen;income range, between $22,000 and $72,000, we find today that that has now been reduced to 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when ordinary Australians talk about the squeeze on middle Australia, the so&hyphen;called middle class, if one looks at these figures one can see that borne out in terms of the household income. That is a concern, and of course it relates to housing affordability which is significantly related to the subject matter of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other statistics which bear out a similar story. If we take the research undertaken by Professor Bob Gregory and Mr Boyd Hunter at the Australian National University's Centre for Economic Policy Research, we find that there has been a significant increase in the geographic polarisation of household incomes across Australia. Their research, which was released last year, found that in the top five per cent of areas ranked according to their socioeconomic status, household income increased by $12,555&mdash;that is an increase of 23 per cent between 1976 and 1991&mdash;when measured in constant 1995 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet in the lowest five per cent of areas, household income fell by $7,589. That is also 23 per cent but in this case it is a decline over the same period. So for the top five per cent of households according to this study there has been an increase in income of 23 per cent over that period of time, yet for the bottom five per cent of households in this country there has been a decrease in income by 23 per cent. Again, these figures support what Mr Ruthven had shown in his studies&mdash;that there is a widening gap between the rich and the poor in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1976, the weekly income gap between the average household income in the bottom one per cent of census collector districts and the average household income in the median census <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1186"> collector districts was not very large. A census collector district is a small area of 200 or 300 houses. So we are talking about an area of a few blocks, less than the size of a suburb. We can actually define small areas of suburbs right throughout Australia by reference to census collector districts. In 1976, an additional part&hyphen;time job, for nine hours a week at $12 an hour, could have closed the gap. Yet, by 1991, it required not nine hours a week of additional income&mdash;for example, a part&hyphen;time job&mdash;but, in fact, 19 hours a week to close that gap. That is evidence from yet another study showing that the gap between those who are well off and those who are less well off in this country has been increasing over the last 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks at the other end of the scale&mdash;that is, the gap between the median census collector districts and the top one per cent&mdash;one sees a widening of that gap as well. In 1976, it required an additional weekly income of $442 to close the gap, which is a considerable amount of money. Yet, by 1991, the amount needed to close that gap had risen to $885. So again one can see the stretching out of the gap between the those on the middle level and those on the highest levels of income. In fact, in 1991 it required, in annual terms, $44,489 to bridge the gap between the middle and the top one per cent. So we see an increase in the gap between the middle and the top levels and we see an increase in the gap at the other end, between the middle and the bottom levels. Again, that study points to the fact that housing affordability for many Australians is something that has become increasingly precarious in this country over the last couple of decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the social commentator and researcher Jeanne Strachan pointed out last year&mdash;and I think this is a matter which all honourable members should be aware of and something which ought to concern us in terms of the future of this country&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young couples today are the first generation since the war to face the reality that they often can't obtain, even with two full&hyphen;time workers in the house, what their own parents saw as fair and reasonable reward for their hard work.</PARA>
<PARA>What she is hearing from hundreds and possibly thousands of focus groups which she and her associates have conducted across the country is young people saying that today, to be able achieve what their parents regarded as fair and reasonable&mdash;that is, essentially, to be able to buy a house and to pay it off&mdash;even with two full&hyphen;time incomes, is becoming increasingly difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, it is my belief that it is the intention of all members of parliament ideally to be able, through their efforts, to, in some way, contribute to making this country a better place. I think that these sorts of trends which are occurring ought to concern us all. It, therefore, gets back to questions about the essential and fundamental problems with the Australian economy which have developed over the last 20 years and our need to be able to address them. We need to be able to address them if we are going to hand on to the next generation of Australians a country in a state at least equal to, if not better than, that in which it has been handed on to us. But all the trends are increasingly suggesting that, in fact, the state of the country, as it has been developing over the last two decades, is going in the opposite direction, and that is a major challenge for government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not wish to add any more to that. This bill has given me an opportunity to say something about those trends and to place them on the record of this committee. If they continue, it is not just the question of housing affordability and the economic problems that arise from that&mdash;and they are manifold&mdash;it is also the social and personal trauma that flows from these sorts of trends in this country. Therefore, if we are looking ahead to the next century and asking what sort of country we are going to hand on to the next generation of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1187"> Australians, then it is incumbent upon us to try to address the fundamental problems of this economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill can make the corporation more competitive, if in some small way it is able to return some amount of money to the government&mdash;which it will&mdash;from the reserves that are there and therefore deal with some of the deficit and the debt that this country has, then that is one small step towards actually dealing with the problem that we have at the present time. I, with other members, commend the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister)(11.26 a.m.)&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to thank the members who have participated in the debate. It has been a very bipartisan debate because the bill was introduced by the previous government and is now being picked up by the Howard government. The details of that bill have been adequately covered by the previous two speakers here this morning. I would like to pick up on the opportunity, which the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) took, to expand a little on the importance of housing and families in Australia. The affordability of owning a home is a very important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this was first introduced under the Menzies government, Menzies had a concern for families and home ownership. As a government today, we are concerned about the same things. The debate here today has been a bipartisan one, one in which there is a sense of people working together for the benefit of Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another bill that the previous government had prepared for introduction, so it is of no surprise that we have consensus across the parliament for the process of this legislation. It seems to be this little hiatus of pleasurable relations that come not long after the changeover.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to reiterate some of the points that we had in mind, and then make a couple of observations, particularly for my good friend the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), who will pick up on this now that he sits on that side of the House, I am sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One is a basic proposal. This is an omnibus bill and it has a proposal to ensure that, when there are changes in either the research data or the physical structure&mdash;through erosion, or whatever&mdash;of the marine boundaries around Australia, the exploration licences that have been granted to the mining and resources industry may lose their validity because of those structural <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1188"> changes in the geography. Or, as in the case of the waters off Western Australia, we have areas where the data is so old&mdash;it is 19th century marine data&mdash;that now, with modern technology, we are actually changing the boundaries and the maps, so some of these licences may no longer be valid. This legislation ensures that those licences remain in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a bill to change the arrangements in the poultry industry, which Michael Lee, our shadow spokesman in the health area, is going to speak about as well. The changes represent an advance in the arrangements for the industry, particularly in making provision for an extra contribution to research and development, which is something all of us would encourage for product development and better marketing of the product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very interesting step forward&mdash;I guess we would call it that&mdash;in relation to Wool International, in that the bill provides for the wool tax to be modified from 5.5 per cent down through 4.5 per cent to zero. That reflects the fact that the industry has come through the crisis of the mid&hyphen;1980s, with the stockpile, the collapse of prices that occurred at that time, the oversupply in the industry and all the things which we all worked our way through. I note that such problems are around again. That is just the cycle of the market for this product, but the industry is now better equipped to deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with some passing interest that the government has seen fit not to change the provision we made that would prevent cashed&hyphen;up wool growers from buying up greater equity in the stockpile by making additional contributions. The purpose of the provision was to ensure that well&hyphen;off producers would not be able to increase, at the expense of other eligible wool taxpayers, either their equity in a privatised Wool International or their share of the distribution of grower funds derived from wool stockpile sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taken down to its bare bones, you would say that that is the social equity objective. I am not in the least surprised that those on the other side who represent primary producers&mdash;who have always, we have felt, subscribed to a policy of agrarian socialism&mdash;have seen fit to leave intact that provision. But it does represent, I guess, the final steps in a massive transition for the wool industry, which has been around for almost 200 years and which has developed a heavy reliance on government management and support. It is now in that final stage of weaning itself and being like any other private sector industry: responding to market changes, to the need for product development and, very fortunately, to opportunities which now exist in Australia for downstream processing and value adding. A lot of that investment has taken place in the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Five, six or seven years ago, farmers told us that they would not consider selling their wool to local manufacturers under any circumstances. Instead they railed about the need for reform on the waterfront in order to get their products exported offshore. At the same time, they railed against Australians who were not buying Australian made products, such as other primary products. Those farmers and primary producers now have opportunities to supply a domestic market. It is not a big domestic market yet, but life has been breathed back into value adding in Australia. Therefore, there is the opportunity to supply a domestic market which can turn it into a product and sell it both as import replacement and export development. This is something that was not there before and I am sure it is well regarded by all as a factor in easing our reliance on, and in weaning ourselves off being completely dependent on, the performance of overseas buyers and their commercial ethics. At various times overseas buyers have, if not held to ransom these industries, at least placed our producers at a severe disadvantage by a whole range of buying techniques.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1189">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The change of government gives an opportunity for many of us on this side of the House to reflect on the efforts of the past, on the task of the new government in this field, and on our task in opposition as we watch these developments. I reflect on the many days and nights we traipsed around Australia on the Prime Minister's country task force. I reflect on all those meetings with primary producers who thought the world was coming to an end as they were forced to face changed international market conditions as a Labor government went about internationalising the Australian economy. It did not matter whether they were sugar growers, wool growers, wheat growers, beef producers, meat producers or cut flower producers. They were being weaned off a situation where a central body bought whatever was supplied at a price that was sufficient to sustain the industry domestically. In many cases, this product was sold offshore with taxpayer assistance&mdash;often at a loss. It did not make a lot of sense but it was comfortable for primary producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember coming into parliament one night around 1985 and the minister at the time, John Kerin, said that we would be there until 4 o'clock in the morning. This was very common then; there were about 300 primary industry bills. There was this levy and that levy, this management fee and whatever else. There were all these arrangements throughout the industry as the government tried to prop up what at that time was Australia's major export industry in all its various facets. That is what we inherited. That was the way the conservatives in those days managed primary industry and especially the export task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As these things were refined and culled and as people became aware of alternative ways of doing business, Australia has modernised. I have said publicly on many occasions that I think primary producers in Australia have been among the fastest to learn and to respond to these changed conditions whether in my own electorate or in other parts of Australia. We have seen people, when exposed fully to the operations of international markets, change their ways of doing business, change the nature of their investment in their assets and, through the whole process, become very responsive to changed opportunities, not the least being the new opportunities which Labor opened up, particularly with our near neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Holding) will enjoy this story. I remember going to a meeting with dairy producers in the early 1980s. They told me that there were no prospects in Asian markets because the people did not like milk; it was against their religion to drink milk that came from sacred cows. It is okay to laugh, Mr Deputy Speaker. Only 10 years ago, this was serious debate, put to us until midnight at countless meetings in countless areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the CSIRO had come to the conclusion that the real problem was lactose in the milk and that if you changed the product a bit and removed the lactose you would, perhaps, have a new market. In fact, the CSIRO took out a patent for a machine to do that, and it was produced, but no&hyphen;one in Australia was interested in investing in it. The patent was taken up offshore and an offshore manufacturer began producing these machines that Australian dairy producers began buying, and now they have markets all over Asia with lactose&hyphen;free milk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, piece by piece, it has been an education process. It has been one very much of opening up opportunities. It has been one of tough times, from our point of view, having to make changes that people did not understand and did not like, and taking them through. But the whole point of what I am saying here, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that what the new government inherits in primary industries and energy is a vastly different scene from that of 10 years ago. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1190"> It is now an industry that is responsive to the problems that ministers confront relating to them; it is an industry that is now prepared to accept, without dissent, changes such as this. The task now is very much one of managing well a completely new internationalised structure that has been put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody's turn comes around the circle, and our turn will come around the circle again&mdash;sooner rather than later, I hope. All I ask is that you manage well what we have presented to you, after the dramas we have gone through over these 13 years. Do it well, manage it well, and do not let us have to revisit this whole task when we come to it again. I am happy to support the legislation, Mr Deputy Speaker. We do not have any problems with that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to some of the comments from the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe). I must say that it was very interesting when he started to talk about the fact that he had had time to reflect. I think he will need a little bit more time&mdash;in fact, quite a lot of time&mdash;to reflect on some of the very serious failures of the Labor government. But we are debating here today the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, and I would like to concentrate my comments particularly on the wool industry. In so doing, I will first declare an interest. I am a wool grower and I am also very proud to represent one of the premier wool&hyphen;growing areas of Australia. I have to say that the last five years, probably with the exception of one year, have been the worst years the wool industry has faced this century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to come back to that because the member for Burke was talking about the fact that, under the Labor Party, wool growers over recent years have had a heavy reliance on government management and support. I am not sure that there was a lot of support there; I think it was mainly growers being taxed to support themselves. I think the fact that he talked about reliance on government management really does leave the Labor opposition wide open to someone's memory going back a little bit more than just five years to some of the things that the previous government has done. If we look at the origins of the crisis that the wool industry has faced over the last five years we find that the previous government has much to answer for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This crisis, I might add, is not just impacting on wool growers; we are seeing a very serious impact on their families and on the country towns. It really is quite sad to go into many country towns these days and see what has happened because of the decline in the fortunes of wool growers and the associated industries, which are very significant in country areas and all of which have suffered greatly. The problems that are being faced today obviously go much further than just what is being seen. There has been a very serious lack of reinvestment in many parts of the industry and in local communities. One of the saddest parts about it is that many young people have left the towns and the communities, probably never to return. I think Labor really does have to answer many very serious questions about what has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to go back to 1987&mdash;a bit further than the member for Burke would care to&mdash;and the wool marketing legislation that was brought in by the then minister for primary industries and member for Werriwa, Mr John Kerin. I think that represents the turning point for the whole floor price scheme; it represents the time when, through a very serious mistake in legislation, the government&mdash;maybe not wittingly, but nonetheless&mdash;made changes which have turned out to set in place events that subsequently have caused such enormous heartache and financial difficulties and have seen an industry literally brought to its knees.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1191">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am talking about the government changes to the wool marketing legislation that allowed the floor price to be pushed up to 870c. The former minister has to accept responsibility for that decision&mdash;he had the opportunity to stop that increase at the time and he did not; he chose not to. We subsequently saw the massive growth of the stockpile and the cash reserves of the then Australian Wool Corporation fall from $1.8 billion to a debt that ultimately exceeded $2&half; billion&mdash;a massive loss of capital and increase in debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we saw the minister step in and say, `Well, obviously the 870c is unsustainable. I will cut it to 700c.' When he did this, he gave an ironclad guarantee that that was as low as the price would go and the next time the price was changed it would go up. He travelled around the world and used the words, `This is an ironclad guarantee. We will not reduce it again.' It only took seven months for that ironclad guarantee to be broken. Not only did that lead to a massive loss of confidence in the wool industry but it also led to buyers of wool who had already bought some stocks losing tens of millions of dollars. In fact, one major consumer of Australian wool claims to have lost more than $50 million as a result of that one decision by the then minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it little wonder that the confidence of the consumers of wool was shattered, that the confidence of the growers of wool was likewise shattered, and that those who have continued to grow wool, either because they believed in wool or, in many cases, because they had little alternative, have suffered mightily because of what the government has done? So when the member for Burke talks about more recent events and a heavy reliance on government management and support, I do not think that management was too good in the past. One could argue about whether or not the more recent management was anything more than a face&hyphen;saving exercise for what would have to be one of the worst decisions of this century in agricultural marketing terms&mdash;a decision that was taken by a member of his government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could go on about the performance of the former government but a couple of other things stand out. One is that when legislation on wool was being debated, more often than not it was being debated under a guillotine, which I think showed the level of importance that the Labor party placed on wool. The final insult, in terms of taking cheap political points from the whole thing, was when this decision to remove the wool tax&mdash;the 4&half; per cent from 1 July this coming year&mdash;was announced, it was announced right in the middle of the election campaign because the government of the day thought it could gain some political kudos. Well, as events have subsequently shown, that did not work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The task is now very much ahead of the new government and I would like to look at a couple of points in this legislation. In his second reading speech, the minister made a very sensible statement when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes that the industry's long term future lies in it continuing to move towards a market driven approach, closely attuned to the needs of customers and end users and free from unnecessary government involvement.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I think those words are indeed very appropriate and they show very much what the approach of the new government will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned the question of the removal of the wool tax. As the second reading speech points out, this will be done in such a way that the 4&half; per cent tax will enable a setting of the wool tax payable to Wool International by regulation; by doing this, in turn, it can then be set to zero.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1192">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next I would like to touch on the marketing activities of Wool International. This is a very interesting approach, which is somewhat different from the approach that had been proposed by the previous government. The then minister, it would appear, was willing to give Wool International the opportunity to take up to $24 million of what effectively was wool growers' funds to operate in a futures market, or in setting up a system to allow wool growers to try and look at ways and means of hedging against future price variations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that the changes to what was proposed by the previous government are, firstly, that Wool International will require the prior approval of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy before it can commence trading in this program through Wool International Holdings. Furthermore, it is important to note that this approval will be tabled and its making advised in the government <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, so either house of parliament will be able, during a period of three sitting days, to disallow this approval. Furthermore, the provision will be subject to a sunset clause so that if approval has not been given by the minister by 1 July 1997 the provision will no longer have effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is very important to note. The parliament has a responsibility to ensure that a statutory body such as Wool International, even through one of its subsidiaries, is not able to go off willy&hyphen;nilly and start speculating in the market on the whole question of futures and options and anything else it may see that could be of some assistance to wool growers. As we all know, this speculation is high risk and I believe that there is a duty to ensure that wool growers' funds are properly and responsibly accounted for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to get back to a couple of things about the wool industry itself. It has been quite encouraging to see that at long last, after some very serious falls in the price of wool over the last few months, there has been a gain in all categories in the last week, particularly at the fine wool end. I believe that if we are going to see a recovery in wool prices it will be led by the fine wool end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I do not think these gains to date are really anything to get too carried away with. For 23 micron wools and stronger we are really only seeing their prices make up for the losses in prices since Easter. To put it in perspective, 21 and 22 micron wools are back to January levels and finer wools are back to the levels of September last year, well below what the market was a year ago and well below the long&hyphen;term average&mdash;I might add, for the vast majority of growers, also well below the cost of production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I conclude I would like to say something about where I see some of the future directions for the wool industry heading and the areas that have to be looked at. I believe the new government does have a very big task ahead of it in assisting wool growers to rebuild their industry, and it may well be that there is an opportunity for some outside work to be done. The whole question of how the wool chain operates and how some of the statutory bodies themselves operate needs to be looked at. In particular, the whole question of the way the promotion of wool has been carried out&mdash;notwithstanding that there are many changes&mdash;could be looked at. The way the International Wool Secretariat operates could very well be assisted by some views from those outside the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the second area that the wool industry has to look at very seriously is the level of skills amongst the growers themselves. While there are some very notable achievements being made, overall there is still a lot of work to be done to assist growers to upgrade their skills both in production and in marketing. Clearly, as we go into the second half of the 1990s, those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1193"> skills are going to be absolutely essential for growers who are going to stay in the industry and succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's comments about reducing the role of government are timely. It is obviously very important that the more government can get out of the wool industry the better. I recognise that if you are going to have statutory levies to work where there is a market failure for research or, indeed, promotion then government probably will have some role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area that does need addressing by the industry is the question of the quality of the product. I think the wool industry has in the past developed a very high quality product, which really makes it something very special. I have some concerns that in recent years there has been a tendency, in some sectors of the industry at least, to blend down the quality of the better parts of the clip instead of promoting the better parts as a specialty product and not something that can be just blended into the lesser qualities to make more of an average type product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In supporting the moves by the government, I put those qualifications particularly on the operations of Wool International Holdings and I believe that is something we have to watch very closely. I believe that the industry will turn itself around. I believe that demand will improve as this year progresses and, indeed, as the subsequent year comes along. I find it somewhat curious that there is talk of increasing the level of promotion and at the same time concerns are being raised that there could be a shortage of wool within two to three years. I would just mention this in passing because I do think that the industry still has a long way to go to get itself back on its feet and in a strong healthy position where it can withstand the ups and downs of the market as it always has in the past. I again emphasise the point that many of the problems the wool industry faces today can be traced back to the fateful decision in 1987. I think that while the member for Burke might be doing some of his reflection he might reflect on that too.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to participate in this discussion on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. I will be confining my remarks to those elements of the bill that deal with the health of the poultry industry in Australia and, in particular, the amendments that deal with the changes to the way levies are placed on the industry to allow commitments to the Australian Animal Health Council, and the change in recognising the new industry representative organisation for the egg industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments that I want to make today are in the area of cooked chicken. It is an area that is of great concern to the future of the poultry industry. I acknowledge that the measures that are included in this bill are ones which some elements of the industry would recommend, but the issues that I want to speak about today I am sure are of direct concern to large numbers of people who are involved in the poultry industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern was triggered by an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 16 May, headed `Howard in trouble if chicken ban lifted'. It read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government is likely to accept a recommendation that the import ban on cooked chicken meat be lifted in a move that looks set to enrage both chicken farmers and its own backbench.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ban on chicken exports was a key issue in some marginal seats during the election in March, such as the seat of Paterson, where chicken farmers lobbied heavily for the ban to be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to mention that the industry employs 16,000 people in Australia, with retail sales of around $1.7 billion. It said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1194">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Party, of which Mr Anderson, the minister, is a member, has in the past vigorously defended the export ban in parliament&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the ban on the importation of cooked chicken meat&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on the basis of production subsidies from potential competitors such as the US and the EC and cheap labour and tax incentives in Thailand, which is now a major exporter.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I am concerned, is that there is a large number of people who live on the central coast of New South Wales whose direct livelihood depends on the future of the Australian poultry industry. The central coast branch of the Chicken Growers Association, which represents 90 poultry farmers on the central coast in the Gosford&hyphen;Wyong area, supports a continuation of the ban. They have recently put out a statement saying that it will be a big threat, not just to the future of the poultry industry, but to Australia's native wildlife, if cooking protocols are not followed overseas and we increase the risk of newcastle disease making its way to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr George Sidiropoulos, the president of the central coast branch of the Chicken Growers Association, has made the point quite strongly in my own local area about the importance of making sure that the risk of newcastle disease coming to Australia is not increased by measures which the government is currently contemplating, if it has not already implemented them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I think we all acknowledge the economic importance of this industry. I would like today to touch on just a few of the concerns I have about the government's proposals in this area. This consideration has been triggered by applications from the United States, Denmark and Thailand for permission to import chicken meat to Australia. I acknowledge that Australia, as a country that depends on exports for a significant proportion of our gross domestic product, has to be a country that plays fair in the international trading game. But I think we have to be very careful about opening up Australia's markets in a way that exposes our domestic industries to the risk of imported disease. One of the countries seeking to export chicken meat to Australia is the United States. The US is a great believer in talking about free trade, but if you ask people involved in the meat export industry of Australia they will tell you that they do not exactly have free trade with the United States in exporting meat to that country. There are any number of products that we in Australia cannot export to the United States because they do not exactly believe in a level playing field as far as trade is concerned in many products that affect their rural industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With Thailand, we know that there are significant import duties and restrictions placed on many Australian manufactured goods so that they cannot be exported to Thailand today. I am not saying that means that we should not allow any imports from those countries. Far be it from me to argue against such a restrictive trade policy. But I think that Australia does have the right to say that, if countries are demanding that we open up our markets for cooked chicken imports, we should be allowed to look at the performance of countries such as the United States, Thailand, and Denmark, for that matter, as to how open their markets are for other Australian products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why I have concerns, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that AQIS, the Quarantine Inspection Service, quite freely admits that there is a concern about avian influenza and newcastle disease in Thailand. The United States also has difficulties with avian influenza. Also, the US has not yet completed its eradication program for salmonellosis, a particularly virulent version of the salmonella virus. These concerns also extend to some elements of diseases that affect the poultry industry in Denmark. So, for all of these reasons, I think it is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1195"> fair for us to ask AQIS to ask the government what risk we are exposing our domestic poultry industry to by importing cooked chicken meat into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to an AQIS pamphlet on newcastle disease that says the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Newcastle disease, the most feared avian disease in the world, has penetrated into most countries. Australia so far is free from the pathogenic forms of this disease. When the disease first enters a country it can cause havoc in the bird industry. Commercial flocks, fancy birds, pet birds and native wild birds are all susceptible. Thousands of birds may die. Those that appear to recover can pass the disease on to healthy birds and may themselves remain chronically ill for the rest of their lives. There is no known cure for Newcastle disease. The disease is caused by a virus, so drugs do not help. Birds continue dying even if heavily medicated.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what AQIS says about newcastle disease. While AQIS might think that there is an acceptable risk in allowing cooked chicken imports from these countries, my concern is that AQIS always acknowledges that there is no such thing as zero risk when you are importing products from these countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like the government to explain to us how they have tried to weigh up the balance between the risk of damage they are exposing the Australian poultry industry to as a result of these diseases and the benefits they believe will flow to the Australian economy by allowing these imports. I can certainly remind the House that members of the coalition have in the past raised a number of concerns about the import of cooked chicken meat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a speech to the House in 1995 the current Chief Government Whip, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), made the following remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the chicken meat industry, the economic gain to consumers is said to be about $3 million a year. The cost to the industry if there were an outbreak of newcastle disease is estimated, on average, at about $30 million a year. So if we get one outbreak in a 10&hyphen;year period, any economic advantage is lost immediately.</PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Cadman certainly had concerns back in 1995. The member for Maranoa and current Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Bruce Scott, made the following remarks in 1994 when speaking on behalf of the then opposition in a debate on primary industries:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The possible relaxation of Australian quarantine regulations relating to imported chicken meat is of great concern to the domestic industry.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naturally, there is concern for the impact on local producers, but just as important is the concern for the possible introduction of the world's most feared disease in the poultry industry, the newcastle virus.</PARA>
<PARA>I might also add a local flavour by bringing to the attention of the Main Committee the views of the state Liberal member for Gosford, Mr Chris Hartcher. He was reported in the local paper this week, under the headline `MP warns against meat trade', as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gosford MP Chris Hartcher claims the Federal Government proposal to allow cooked chicken meat to be imported into Australia would jeopardise the Central Coast's multi&hyphen;million dollar poultry industry and threaten Australia's native bird populations.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there would be certificates saying the product complied with health regulations there is no doubt that there would be abuses and forgeries.</PARA>
<PARA>This is in places such as Thailand. Those are comments by Chris Hartcher, the Liberal state member for Gosford, attacking the federal government over this decision. Mr Hartcher also claims the introduction of cooked chicken meat would provide a perfect opportunity for newcastle disease to find its way into Australia to infect native bird species.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1196">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those concerns expressed by Liberal and National party members of parliament in the past demonstrate that the Labor Party is not the only party concerned about the risk that newcastle disease poses to the Australian poultry industry. The former member for Paterson, Bob Horne, the current member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and even you, Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Adams), when you are wearing another hat as the member for Lyons, have expressed concern about this issue and the impact it might have on Australia's native birds and the Australian poultry industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can understand why the former member for Paterson has been so concerned about the impact on the poultry industry because 2,000 people are employed in that industry in the electorate of Hunter. It is an industry that is very important to the central coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that my colleague the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) has joined us in the Main Committee. I understand that at this stage he might not be able to speak, given that he is to make his maiden speech within the next day or two. If he is not able to speak today, he might make some remarks at a future time of his choosing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point to make about this is that it is an issue of vital importance to the central coast and the poultry industry and one that I hope might have continuing bipartisan support, given the comments that have been made by Mr Hartcher and by Liberal members when they were in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn very briefly to the last point I would like to make, and that is about some remarks that were made this week by Senator Parer, the representative of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in the Senate. After mentioning a quarantine risk assessment into the potential impact of imports of chicken meat from the USA, Thailand and Denmark, he said that this could be looked after by having the AQIS staff carry out prior inspection of the Thai processing plants. He made the following remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importation from Thailand would be subject to prior inspection by AQIS of the Thai processing plants. AQIS will publish a statement within a few days setting out the detailed arrangements under which the importation of cooked chicken meat from these countries will be allowed.</PARA>
<PARA>But my colleague Senator Bryant Burns asked Senator Parer whether there would be a continuing presence of the AQIS officers to ensure that the quality of the process was maintained after the production process started and that there was a continuing inspection process. Senator Burns asked on 20 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that there are reports in the press from time to time about the lack of integrity of some people in Thailand, will there be a presence of AQIS to ensure the quality of that particular process?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Parer says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand your concerns on this matter. I think that you probably missed what I said in the response. What I did say was, in regard to Thailand, that anything to do with that area in regard to chicken meat would be subject to prior inspection by AQIS of their processing plants. As I also indicated to you&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and then Senator Burns interjects:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continual.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Parer responds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. There will be a statement in a few days setting out the detailed arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>That is contradictory. On the one hand, Senator Parer says that there will only be prior inspection by AQIS. Yet, in response to Senator Burns's interjection asking whether there would be continuing inspection by AQIS, Senator Parer says that there will be continuing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1197"> inspection by the AQIS officers. At the very least we are entitled to have that matter clarified. If the AQIS staff are only going to carry out these inspections once at the very beginning, there is no guarantee whatsoever that tough standards will be maintained and that we are minimising the risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My preference&mdash;and this is the strong view of people involved in the poultry industry on the central coast&mdash;is that we do not take any risk with the importation of cooked chicken meat, whether or not we have AQIS inspectors in Thailand. But I certainly would like to know what the government's plans are in deciding to allow chicken meat to be imported into Australia. This is an issue that I, and I hope many other members of both sides of the House, will be raising on many occasions in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before us, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, is a composite bill that covers a number of issues, and the previous speaker has taken the opportunity to raise matters relevant to the chicken industry. It is of grave concern, of course, to his constituents and those of other members in the government that those matters be properly addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a representative of an area that produces a substantial amount of wool, I wish to address the issues relevant to Wool International and Wool International Holdings that are also covered in this legislation. The legislation, as the minister points out in his second reading speech, is designed to have an amendment which widens the opportunity of Wool International in terms of its activities. Wool International today is a body set up primarily to dispose of the wool stockpile, and I would like to come back to some aspects of that if time permits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Early in its development there was a considerable debate because the original enabling legislation made it possible for Wool International to become a privatised public company. There was an intention, I think, on behalf of its bureaucracy or executive and its board of directors to turn itself into some major wool trading organisation using as its capital base any surplus associated with the disposal of the stockpile and other items referred to in this legislation as non&hyphen;wool assets, such as wool stores, that have become part of the original wool corporation activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem that we have with all of this is that, notwithstanding the desires of the board and bureaucracy of Wool International, most wool growers have indicated that they would not want a company created with those funds and the consequent issue of shares to them to cover the contribution they made to this particular establishment through the wool tax, which is also referred to in this legislation. They made it clear that, when this particular arrangement is completed, wool growers want their money back. They want the surplus distributed in cash. They do not want another body active in wool marketing which they have to fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consequently, of course, the directors and others had a short opportunity for employment. There is a point in time when the last bale of wool will be sold under the compulsory fixed disposal arrangements. They, of course, are now having another try to prove to the wool industry that they would serve a longer term purpose. I object to this attempt and think that this particular legislation as proposed is totally unnecessary. Nevertheless, it is still before us and it is to be considered by this House today. I would argue very strongly that it is not needed and, in fact, that it represents very grave risks to the funds of wool growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that the proposal as listed in the legislation is quite generic. I will read from the explanatory memorandum in this regard. It says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1198">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. Wool International is to be given power to undertake, through a subsidiary such as Wool International Holdings, wool marketing activities, including forward trading and the use of futures and currency contracts for hedging purposes. The amendments would facilitate Wool International undertaking a limited program of forward trading to assist in the development of a broader range of risk management options for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. This program would be subject to strict conditions contained in the approval required from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to ensure, amongst other things, the trading activities are kept separate from those of Wool International proper, whose main concern will remain the management of the stockpile.</PARA>
<PARA>I feel that those final words are in fact a contradiction in themselves. The first problem that we have with this arrangement is the suggestion that a subsidiary of the proprietor of over two million bales of wool would be seen in the forward marketing and futures marketing area as somehow being totally at arm's length from a trading organisation of that size. It is just a foolish suggestion. It is an established fact that people trying to deal in that market would see the ability of Wool International to affect the market by its disposal policies. There is no way that it could convince those people otherwise. I find there is a contradiction in any suggestion that Wool International Holdings, this proposed company, could go to the point of being an arms length operative in the futures market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to ask ourselves why the wool industry's future would be better effected by this particular proposed activity. The legislation, which is totally blue sky, just enables the minister to approve various schemes that Wool International might put to the minister from time to time. So we are here today giving that power to the minister but we do not know exactly how it might apply. The minister, in his second reading speech, did put forward some conditions as to how the matter might be controlled, and some conditions on himself. Because of debates within our party forums he has proposed a sunset clause. He has also proposed that the proposals be a disallowable instrument with three days notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, it does not change the fundamental question: why would substantial amounts of wool growers' money be required to be used for this purpose? The purpose must be a benefit to wool growers. When we look at the potential benefit, someone might argue that there is a need for futures or forward trading. That need is adequately met at present. There is a body known as the Sydney Futures Exchange which will trade you a contract on wool futures at any time you like to contact them. The Macquarie banking people have just announced an insurance policy whereby wool growers for a fee can insure the price of their wool at some time in the future. Clearly, the fee would reflect the amount of money they hope to get at the time. The only certainty of futures selling is that there is always a winner and a loser. History, I think, would prove that wool growers have been more the loser than the winner in these transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, there are the major wool brokers. Any wool producer can get them on the phone and say, `Look, I'm going to shear in October. I've got this particular wool style and here are the details associated with it in terms of micron measurement et cetera. How much will you give me for it?' Those companies will quote you a price. The price might not be one that you would like to get, but the company will do it. So there is a plethora of forward selling and forward risk management opportunities available to wool growers. So the question might be asked: what is the involvement of Wool International through Wool International Holdings going to do to improve that situation?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1199">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of my wool growers tell me that they have tried forward marketing from time to time and not found it to have improved their lot. Any suggestion that it would address what is currently a tragic decline in wool prices, particularly with a reputed investment of $24 million, is patently ridiculous. There is no way that anybody could intervene in the wool market at the futures or forward marketing level and try to shift the price, other than with billions of dollars and that would also be a grave risk. When you enter into the futures markets there always has to be a second person. There are some very, very big investors around the world who literally speculate in futures. If they saw an opportunity to corrupt one market with just pure money they would do it. You would need a lot of money to take them on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the reality is that, although the legislation does not tell us, we have a situation where up to $24 million of wool growers' money is to be taken out of Wool International, and made available for this particular body, Wool International Holdings, to be used to play on the futures market. As members of this House, that is as much as we know about what might happen. Admittedly, the minister tells us when it ceases to be blue sky. I do not know why we have to legislate for blue sky. I have seen examples of that in Western Australia. They used to call it WA Inc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we are going to have a look at that. When we do, the minister may or may not approve of it, depending on the comments. Considering his determination to have this piece of legislation, I am convinced that he will want to go on with it. But I do not see benefit for my wool growers. I see grave risk with the money. An official of Wool International actually gave me a very good promise. He said that, if they lost the $24 million, he could promise me that they would not spend any more. But there is a serious opportunity of additional funds being called on if there is some argument that the thing is working positively. I do not know for whom because, unless it affects the price of wool, there is little benefit for wool growers. I am totally opposed to the argument that these sorts of bodies can actually make profits for wool growers through their own investment strategies. At the moment, we can see this in the wheat industry fund where money is being taken forcibly from the wheat growers and they are being told that wonderful profits are being made for them at about 17 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of Wool International and Wool International Holdings, you have the huge stockpile made available through the pooling system of the Australian Wheat Board and you can sell wheat to the subsidiary that does the private domestic trading. Of course, you can make any amount of profit you like simply by discounting the pool wheat to yourself. That is being done and, in my view, it is the reason for these substantial profits. But, of course, the person who has delivered wheat to the pools is the loser. Of course, if Wool International Holdings eventually starts declaring profits, it is because it has been buying wool from the stockpile for a lower price than it might otherwise sell. They tell us that it is all commercial and above board; they tell us that they never talk to each other in private. That is rubbish; we all know better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my last few minutes, having expressed my total opposition to this component of the legislation&mdash;it is all in a single bill&mdash;I want to say that there are some good parts in it. We are very pleased that the minister has decided to change the wool tax collection arrangements and to put them under regulation. In fact, the wool tax, compared to the research levies, will come down to zero. I approve of that wholeheartedly. It leaves the legislation as a package and, consequently, I am not planning to vote against it. But, on behalf of my constituents, I want the opportunity to express my opposition to this proposal and to give them a guarantee <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1200"> that, when the fine detail is made available to us, I will be looking at it extremely closely. I  hope other members in this place will take note of the fact that it will be a disallowable instrument. If they think it is not in the interest of the wool growers they represent, I hope they choose to take some action in that regard. I can assure them that, if that is my view, they will have my support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to comment on the very serious circumstances confronting the wool industry which we should be debating today. We should be debating initiatives to get the price of wool up. There are a few factors that need to be known including the fact that stockpile disposal and wool production&mdash;if we include that stockpile disposal as part of wool production&mdash;is not high in Australia. We have certainly seen a period in international markets where demand has been low. But production is also low in Australia and it is very unusual for wool prices to continue to decline in that situation, if we were relying purely on the auction system. We are not. Wool International has decided that, to meet its fixed disposal obligations, it will sell by forward trading. It has consequently destroyed all confidence in the auction system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will never forget the remarks made by a wool broker during the debates on the collapse of the reserve price scheme. He said, `As a wool broker, I do not care how high the price of wool goes; but I have one very serious concern, and that is the price that my competitor will pay for wool tomorrow.' That is what drives the market&mdash;what your competitor might buy wool for tomorrow. Of course, once they cannot control that through the auction system, they can only insure themselves by constantly bidding less. The reason why they are being obliged to bid less is that you get a big price on Tuesday at auction and you know very well that Wool International is on the phone while you are bidding, selling wool at a lower price to some other buyer. There is very little confidence. Nobody is carrying stockpiles. Everybody has run down their stocks. They are not prepared to take a long&hyphen;term risk in wool. It was not that many years ago that speculators made money by buying wool at auction&mdash;actually physically taking control of it, storing it and reselling it at a later time. It was part of the system, and it worked, and it should be happening now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a big debate in Western Australia about what should happen. I have constituents who argue that the stockpile should be frozen again; I have constituents who argue that all of the fixed release should go on the auction system at no reserve and let the market fix it up; and there are a few ideas in the middle. I have to tell you that, as a free marketeer, I tend to lean towards the auction system. I do not support the freezing of the stockpile. I would be happy to look at alternatives in between if I could be convinced that they will work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we are not talking about that; we are talking about pie in the sky. We are not confronting an issue that could return billions to people in the wool industry who need it, billions to the nation in terms of additional export income, and, of course, hundreds of millions to the revenue of the government, which is sorely needed in these difficult times to fill that $8 billion black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that this is what the debate should be about. I hope that there are members in this place who will demand of the government that we get onto that issue, because there does not seem to be any practical or proper reason why wool prices continue to decline. I believe that the major reason is lack of confidence generated by the current selling policies of Wool International, which I think is the worst possible option. One of the other options that I have mentioned would be better.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1201">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really need to address that, and we need to address it with alacrity, because it is a tragedy for everyone for which there seems to be no good reason, other than this lack of confidence. So I would ask the House to consider that. I ask the House to look very closely at the detail of this proposal for Wool International Holdings when it is brought to the House and to deal with it accordingly. I cannot see that it is going to do any good for wool growers. I cannot see how it is going to work. I fear greatly that, even through administrative costs, if not through speculative costs, $24 million of wool growers' money could be lost. It is their money, and they are entitled to have it returned to them at the end of this scheme and not wasted by some people who are trying to guarantee their future, not the wool growers' future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) contains some very important stuff. I think one of the problems we have with the committee system is that it can very easily get buried. I did not realise just how important this was until this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch on aspects of the bill. The first part of the bill seeks to deal with the Offshore Minerals Act 1994. What it tends to do is to guarantee the integrity of leases when they are affected by changes to the boundary between Commonwealth and state lands. I entirely support that. The bill does not make it quite clear whether this is retrospective. I believe that it should be retrospective to the enactment of this bill. I know of a couple of places where new surveying has changed the state&hyphen;Commonwealth boundary, with significant detrimental effect on people, and I would hope that they would be protected by this very essential amendment here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) spoke at some length on AQIS and quarantine matters. I cannot find it in the bill&mdash;and, of course, it is not in the bill&mdash;but it does deal with the chicken industry. I entirely support the member for Dobell. I believe that AQIS and the government should take a very hard line with respect to entry of disease into Australia and I believe that we are lessening resolve in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not mind if we are taken by competitors to the world authorities on GATT because I have always believed that GATT is, in fact, a very corrupt document and it is not the way for Australia to go. Every time there has been a significant amendment to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade principal traders have gone out and simply found a way around the new agreement. The French have been notable in this regard and I take my hat off to the French. I think that the French have always acted in the interests of their citizens and that is what governments are for. I believe that this is something the government of this country should certainly consider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to talk about wool. It must be remembered that basically this bill comes from the previous government. I find it passing strange that the new government has so enthusiastically embraced it because I think it is a very flawed document indeed. It is true that this government has made amendments to the part relating to Wool International Holdings, which is what I wanted to talk about. I think that this has made the act better but in my view it is still not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a proposal that arose from minister Collins who, I can say now, never understood the wool industry and never really cared about it. It was a very dangerous move indeed. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has spoken at length about this and I agree with a lot of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1202"> what he has said. I want to foreshadow that I will be dissenting from this bill and I will be seeking a division on the matter in the chamber. I do so for very good reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see no reason at all why anyone would be giving Wool International Holdings $24 million of growers' money. I see that it has done nothing to justify it and, if it wants to justify it, I believe that it should be putting out a prospectus. There are many companies floated on the stock market with a capitalisation of less than this. If Wool International Holdings thinks that it has a saleable commodity, it should be putting out a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Australian Securities Commission and seeing what support it gets from the market. I am sure that it would not get support from growers; it may get it from elsewhere. To say that it is going to initiate changes in marketing is a very dubious proposition. All the things that it talks about are in place already and growers can use them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that futures selling was probably something which originated with the wool industry. It has been used very successfully by the gold industry. I think the reason is that the gold industry has used it as an insurance scheme, not as a gambling scheme. I believe that farmers and wool growers use it as an insurance policy, not as a casino. It is a very useful tool. If they use it as a casino they are inevitably going to get burnt because the house always wins in that scenario.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) was talking about the history of the wool industry. I thought that he was rather harsh on John Kerin. The truth is that had John Kerin opposed raising the wool price under the madman, David Asimus, he would have been hounded and condemned. Fortunately, Asimus was not allowed to put it to 1,000c as he wanted to but it went to 870c, which was fine. That was the floor; it went above that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was one of the people who fought for the establishment of a floor price back in the very early 1970s. While it was a price set just below the cost of production, it probably did not do a lot of damage, although, faced with the same decision, I certainly would not support it again. When these people, led by Asimus, decided to make a price leader they were doomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that John Kerin dropped the price to 700c. It is also true that anyone who knew anything about the industry knew that it was unsustainable. I used to go into committees and argue with John Kerin, who would dump on me, then he would say to me in the corridor, `Of course, you are absolutely right, but I have to hold the line for the government.' He knew, because he was a competent economist, that the 700c was untenable. I believe he should have spoken out about it and said so at the time, but he was under enormous pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He certainly was not helped by the people who run the industry&mdash;the clowns that have encompassed the Wool Corporation and the various people who have been elected to the Wool Council. I think the former member for Wannon and his relation, Hugh Beggs, should come in for a fair amount of criticism with respect to the debacle that was wool marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth about wool is that there is nothing that Wool International Holdings will do that is new or an initiative. If there is, it certainly has not been spelt out. If it believes it has something new, then it is its duty to tell us what it is. There is certainly nothing in the published material. I believe there are other people in the market who can do it as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the member for O'Connor said is absolutely true. Even if you could trust Wool International Holdings to keep an arm's length agreement with Wool International and that stockpile, even if it was trustworthy in that regard&mdash;and believe me, it is not and it will not be able to isolate it&mdash;nobody out in the industry believes that it will. That confidence will not be there.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1203">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the member for O'Connor did touch on a very important point. There has been an enormous loss of confidence in wool marketing and it has been brought about by Wool  International. It has been selling wool at discounted prices. It says, `Nobody complained when we were selling forward at high prices.' The truth was that any mug can sell forward in a rising market at a higher price. I do not believe it maximised the price on those occasions, but anyone can do that. But then to say that the corollary is to sell down in a falling market is absolutely absurd. It is my view that if the government is going to maintain sales for the stockpile, that wool should be dispersed through the auction system, with no reserve price at all. I am not convinced, as the member for O'Connor seems to be, that we need to do that. But certainly, if it going to be disposed of, it should be through the auction system, with no reserve price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that we do have to be very careful about the future of wool because it is in our capacity to destroy the wool market. The truth is that nobody in the world needs wool anymore. It is simply replaceable. But we do have a marketable commodity in Australian wool. I would argue that Australian wool is one of the few things&mdash;and perhaps the only thing&mdash;in Australia that is unique.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CRA said in the paper today that if we mine coal, the Americans will mine it cheaper. If we grow wheat, the Americans will dump theirs on the market. Australian merino wool is the unique product that we have, yet what have we seen? We have seen Australian wool growers' money used to promote wool generically. In a shop, any garment can wear the wool label if it comes off a sheep. It does not really matter that the sheep has more in common with a wire&hyphen;haired fox terrier than a merino, it is still wool and it comes under this generic promotion which is paid for by the Australian wool growers. We should be selling Australian merino wool. It is a unique quality product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in China some time ago on a committee. We asked to go to a store where the Chinese people shopped. We did not want to go into a Friendship store. We got into this place and up on the fifth floor they had a lot of the stuff that was commercially available. I was amazed at the high prices that people were paying. They had a bespoke tailor in there with a big sign which said, `Only the best British cloth used.' I was actually looking for cashmere, but I said to the sales assistant, `Do you have any Australian wool?' `Oh no', she said, `we stock only the very best British wool.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw some jumpers on the counter and asked if could I have a look at one. It was a Pringle garment from one of those great mills along the English&hyphen;Scottish border that produce quality woollen knitwear. It did not have the woolmark on it at all, but it did have a label saying, `Guaranteed pure botany wool. Made in England.' So I said to the girl, `Look, this is Australian wool,' and she grabbed it from me, quite irate, and said `No, no sir, made in England.' That was to her British wool; a triumph of marketing of our product. I think we have been duped enormously by wool marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I finished wool classing&mdash;I think in 1956&mdash;the instructor said to us, `Every one of you will now go out and overclass the clip,' and of course every one of us did. He also said, `If you want a job in 50 years time, you have got to do something about the American market which is the highest fibre user in the world and the lowest consumer of wool.' Those statistics are very much the same today as they were then, despite $2 billion worth of Australian wool <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1204"> growers' money put into a failed attempt to increase promotion there. If you look at Zegna, they have been extraordinarily successful and North America is now one of their big markets. Their marketing approach was to send Jonathan Todhunter in there with a month's wages and  say, `After that you are on your own,' and he was extremely successful. We spent $2 billion basically for nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quality is going to be the name of the game, yet we have seen in recent times the quality of our wool threatened by blending. I asked a question in the House about the blending of Russian wool with Australian wool. I was told firstly that it was not happening, then I was told it had already happened and we really could not do anything about it. There is no doubt the Russians decided to put their 20 micron wool on the market, looking for cash. The Russians do have some 20 micron wool and it is usually very badly faulted. I actually had documents showing where Australian buyers had been asked to get sound 24 micron Australian wool to blend with faulty 20 micron wool to make it 22 micron filament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know of one case of a very large spinner in Europe who recently went through this blending exercise. It produced a lot of thread using the Russian wool blended with the very good quality Australian wool, only to find the whole lot was radioactive. Imagine what that would have done, had it become general knowledge, to confidence in the wool market&mdash;to confidence in what we are promoting as a pure product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time has long passed when we should have been right out of generic wool. We should be selling not Australian wool but wool from various areas of Australia. I think we should be selling specialised lambs' wool from Albany, for instance, and quality wool from other areas. It should be a promotion of Australian wool&mdash;a unique fibre which is very free from impurities and a fibre which the world can have faith in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we actually believe there is going to be a future in wool, we have to take steps to protect our investment now. This means that we must put a ban on the export of our genetic material. It is crazy to do otherwise. I went to a lot of effort to get the agreement through the Labor Party caucus&mdash;by every appropriate means&mdash;that it ban the export of Australian genetic material. It took me 12 months. In that time I went to New Zealand and I consulted with New Zealand stud farmers who said they would be very happy to see a ban applied. They did it only because if they had not someone else would have done so. I got unanimity amongst the major wool studs and enormous support from growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition came from a few greedy, grubby, second&hyphen;rate studs associated with the Australian Merino Breeders' Association. Those are the people who got to Collins. Collins, massively ignorant of the industry, marched into caucus and with very little effort got the caucus to roll the decision it had made and we did not get what was in Australia's interests. Some people say it is too late: not so. The great users of genetic material in the past have been the Soviet bloc, China and Russia. Through incompetence they wasted it. They put a ram out here and a ram out there, instead of putting them into breeding stations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the threat now comes from South America. The Italians are moving in there in a big way. Benetton is buying up large properties in South America. The Italians are not fools and they will not make the same mistake. I believe that we should act `yesterday' to ban the export of this genetic material. The Labor Party had the opportunity and through what I see as the perfidy and stupidity of Senator Collins it was lost. I certainly hope that, if this government seriously considers the future of the industry, it will move quickly to bring in that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1205"> ban on genetic material. If it is not done I believe that the present system of allowing 900 rams a year will be our demise because, with new technologies, it might as well be nine million as 900. I sound that warning and urge the government to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the brief minutes left to me I want to talk about wool marketing. I believe we have to return more money to growers. Commodities throughout the world have been under pressure and the only way I can see out of this for growers is to move further down the production chain and retain ownership of their wool, perhaps down to the single white thread stage, maybe even beyond that. That is going to need some organisation. There is not just one way; there are many ways it can be done. I believe that we should look at doing the very fine wool in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the 20, 22 and 24 micron fibres I suggest that India is the place to look. I believe that India has an industry more competent than that of the Chinese. It has labour costs that are comparable and it has a structure which I think is much easier to deal with than the Chinese. If this is pursued I think we could see a greater return to wool growers. It is quite clear that if there is not a greater return, what we are going to see in a very short time is growers in the great Australian wool industry&mdash;what was the largest small business in this nation and is an industry that is absolutely vital to the wellbeing of the hinterland of Australia&mdash;reduced to the status of peasant shepherds. That is not a future for the wool industry that I want to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe there is a future for the wool industry. I have great faith in it, but Wool International is not part of that future&mdash;Wool International is part of the problem. Garnaut's north&hyphen;east Asian ascendancy and the fools on both sides have led us down this mad chase into Asia&mdash;the Garnaut report in respect of the wool industry was another very flawed document&mdash;and I think it is about time we got a lot more commonsense and commitment into making sure that the wool industry survives as the viable industry that it should be. It should be remembered that if we can increase the value adding process to wool it will very quickly become Australia's biggest single export, exceeding coal. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is little doubt that in a debate like this there is a good deal of common ground. Indeed, on the first two packages concerning the extension of the baselines&mdash;that part of the legislation which really deals more with offshore minerals than it does with any other commodity&mdash;I think there is unanimity. The move is essential. I note the comments by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) about the timing of commencement. I do not know that it would be practical to backdate the legislation. There would be an advantage, if it were possible, but I am always very hesitant about retrogressive legislation. Therefore, I suggest that it should be at least proclaimed from the date when the legislation was first introduced. I do not know whether that part of it was introduced by the previous government. If it were, then it might be back to that date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always had problems about applying legislation retrospectively and, for that reason, I would have hesitation accepting that part of his proposal. Quite demonstrably, there is a need to have more precision in the way in which the offshore baselines are defined and this legislation would in fact achieve that. So, in that part of the legislation, I am glad to see there is little opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the poultry industry amendments in the bill&mdash;before I come to the particular problem of poultry imports&mdash;I think every primary industry today has a major worry in trying to ensure that adequate research and promotion is undertaken. In relation to both the poultry industry <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1206"> and the wool industry, to which I want to make reference in a moment, I am quite concerned at the degree to which the emphasis within CSIRO has changed and the degree to which there is going to be a capacity within CSIRO for it to maintain the enormous input it has made in the past to ensure our products are competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether the CSIRO even undertakes much poultry research. It did in days gone by, but I am unsure whether it still does. In terms of maintaining poultry health and making sure the competitiveness of our poultry stock is such that, domestically and internationally, we can look at being able to produce birds that are fully internationally competitive in meat and egg production, I do not think there would be any denying that we need to maintain a level of commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My worry in relation to the poultry industry has been the extent to which&mdash;as in so many other primary industries&mdash;the family operation is now prejudiced. The economics of survival are becoming more and more acute. We have had a succession of economic disasters in recent years. At present, one of the real problems in the poultry industry is the price of feed. While we are all conscious that, as a result of price surging largely due to a downturn of production in the American agricultural belt, grain prices are likely to be up this year, the real problem for people in intensive livestock industries&mdash;and I classify the poultry industry as one of those&mdash;is that they have to buy in so much of their feedstock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As prices go up, their capacity to produce competitively is affected. It is a major concern and, as a result of it, many of the smaller growers are going out. The bigger growers are of a size that enables them to overwhelm, by their marketing and production techniques, the individual grower. I know in my own state, and in my own electorate which is the second largest poultry producing area in New South Wales, there are enormous problems in trying to remain competitive. I feel very sad for the sake of many of those who were very efficient poultry people in the days gone by. But once the state protection scheme was removed, I am afraid many of them have found it very hard to compete against the bigger operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a worry. And it is not just a matter of looking at imports; it is a matter of ensuring that research and marketing are expanded. It is of interest to note that in the primary sector, almost uniquely, over the years there has been an enormous contribution from producers. Certainly through the levy scheme there has been a big contribution to ensure that they are maintaining collectively some capacity to research and develop their product. This legislation is introducing regulations for that very purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter raised first by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), I&mdash;like all of those who represent the poultry industry and, indeed, all agricultural industries&mdash;am worried about the import of disease into this country. One only has to see what has happened with the mad cow disease in the United Kingdom. It is true that our big advantage in the past has been our tremendous reputation for the purity of our stock. The fact that we are an island continent, that the oceans ensure there is distance and a quarantine barrier, has been a tremendous advantage to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Kalgoorlie was talking about South America a while ago and future competition in the wool industry. One of our big advantages is that we have not had the disease problems that they have had in their cattle herds and their other livestock. We have to maintain that reputation and I, therefore, am one of those who believes that exactly the same protocols must apply to the production of poultry in any country that seeks to have their product imported into Australia, and that the country and the region have to be sufficiently <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1207"> isolated from any disease, such as newcastle disease, which could be introduced into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never been happy about pork imports from Canada and I am no more happy about the prospect of poultry imports from Thailand or anywhere else. At the same time, unlike the  honourable member for Kalgoorlie, I believe the Uruguay Round of the GATT was tremendously to our advantage. If we can have free and open trade, particularly in agricultural commodities, it is to Australia's advantage, and certainly to the advantage of our primary exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason I certainly believe that we have to comply within the overall intention of the world trade obligations that are now imposed on us. Yet I would hope that any protocols applied by AQIS&mdash;as to whose integrity in maintaining our quarantine borders I have always been rather sceptical&mdash;for the imported product are absolutely certain. Having been minister for primary industries when we first thought blue tongue had come into Australia, only to find that it was a non&hyphen;virulent strain of blue tongue, I do not want to see a circumstance where in any of our livestock industries we have any threat to local production. Of course, there is also the problem of a further competitive threat to those small and family owned operations of which I spoke a few moments ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main part of this legislation on which I want to say a few words is the wool industry. First, the Australian wool industry is not one industry. There are more than 1,000 types of Australian wool. When people talk about the wool industry, they need to comprehend its diversity, from the superfines down to the strong wools. Those thousand types each have a different market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been very concerned about the research side of the industry. I am appalled at any suggestion, for example, that in my own region the CSIRO research stations at Chiswick, Longford and Arding should be closed. I am most concerned at the impact on the animal production division of any prospective closure because of inadequate funding for research. In this bill there is talk of providing $24 million to Wool International, and I will come to that in a moment. I would far prefer that that $24 million be allocated to research and promotion. I am not happy at the way promotion has been handled in the recent years. I believe that the general drift in the market has been partly because the people responsible, first the Australian Wool Corporation and more recently Wool International, have not known what they have been promoting. They have moved from promoting superfine wool and wool as a quality product to wool in blends&mdash;they are really all over the shop. Part of the problem is that they have got to work out what they are going to promote and promote it, but I think it is important we maintain good promotions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there are those who are cynical about what we have done, and I heard what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said. If you promote a product effectively, it is amazing what you can do. The honourable member was talking about China. All you have to do is to think that the New Zealanders are selling the Chinese gooseberry as kiwi fruit in China to understand how effective marketing can be. It is ridiculous. Here is New Zealand, a small country, which has always been a hell of a lot better than we are in promoting its agricultural produce, actually selling in China, under its brand name, a product that comes from China! As the honourable member suggested, we have tended to be pretty appalling in the way we have marketed wool. We have got to do something about it. So, if we have got $24 million to spend, I would not mind spending it on research and promotion and get a bit of value for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1208"> money rather than hand it to Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I would point out that the intention of this legislation is not specifically to put Wool International into the business of marketing wool. It is rather to set up a framework to see what it has to offer. The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), when  he opened the debate, intimated that it was really a product of legislation of the previous government. I think we have to try to see what Wool International is going to come up with, but my own assessment is that Macquarie Bank and others are introducing any amount of techniques for forward cover of wool. The futures market, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said, was in fact begun by Sid Hall in wool as a commodity before the Sydney Futures Exchange. It was Sid Hall's innovation in futures wool selling that began futures trading in Australia. So there have been ways by which you can cover wool in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are never going to sell wool in futures at a time when the market is declining. It demonstrably is going to make it very difficult for those techniques to succeed while the market is still floundering. Fortunately, it is now starting to recover. On a rising market there is an opportunity for the buyers to hedge, and I suspect that, if the market does remain about where it is at the moment, some vendors may even think of using the cover that Macquarie Bank is now offering. I think that there are any number of other ways through the Sydney Futures Exchange that wool can be already covered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not too sure that Wool International has a role in hedging. I am one of those who are pretty sceptical about Wool International and its forward selling. I would have far preferred that some flexibility be introduced. I do not like the idea of its continuing to bear down on the market by offering wool forward at a rate which discounts the auction system. I believe that in some instances, by withdrawing wool from auction and then discounting it for forward sale, as Wool International asserts its scheduled selling, as a result of the Garnaut report, obligates it to do, it has forced the market down unnecessarily, and I think that it is very regrettable that that should be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who is still in the chamber, that I was not here when my colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) talked about the problems during the era that John Kerin was minister for primary industry. As far as I am concerned, the real guilt during John's term as minister for primary industry was his change of the Wool Marketing Act. Because the act that I had introduced so long before was changed, the industry was no longer required to retain price relativity to other fibres and this led to the 870c minimum reserve price.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You never take the advice of industry unless you know it is the right advice. Regrettably, the wool industry is still so divided that it does not know where it is going, and that is part of its problem today. I am very critical of the Wool Council; it has more opinions than there are wool growers. Frankly, until they make up their minds about what they are going to do, we are going to have strife.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I introduced that old minimum reserve price scheme, it was essential that the price maintain relativity to the price of other fibres. Had that been retained, wool would not have risen to 870c and the fall to 700c would have been a slower fall because, as other price relativity was maintained, this would have ensured that wool came down. Of course there were other factors and, as far as I am concerned, there is no use turning back the clock. I want to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1209"> look at tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wool is a fibre for the future. As I have said, there are thousands of different wool types. The superfine wool that is in the best fabrics is a wool that can blend. It can be used for all sorts of new products. One of the reasons I am interested in the $24 million going into building up the money for research and promotion is that, as wool incomes are down, the producers are less able, through levies, to maintain the funding. I want the efforts of CSIRO and others to be maintained to develop markets and so on. In fact, at the moment, there is a new fabric that uses wool to line synthetic fibre. This is a tremendous athletic fibre because it allows the body to breathe but still gives the external attributes of a synthetic fibre. There are all sorts of things that can be done to ensure that wool has different markets in the future. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am in favour of the legislation because I do not believe that it will give Wool International the final authority to go into trading. At least it will enable us to see the new techniques that Wool International believes can be used in the future.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, Wool International does not have a future. I would be quite happy to see it wound up. I would like to see that $24 million go into research and promotion. I think it would probably be better used. I am happy to develop what they have apparently spent some time in developing. I do not want the money to be spent until the parliament has had a look at the legislation. I am delighted to see that, as it is to be by regulations which can be revoked within three sitting days, there is going to be an opportunity to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key items of the program were laid down by the minister in his second reading speech. If they come up with each of his requirements, I will be very surprised. He has set down very tight requirements; I will be looking forward to seeing what is submitted. I urge Wool International to make sure that every member of parliament sees that proposal and has an opportunity to discuss it before any regulations are drafted to implement the spending of the money. As several members have said, it is a field of some controversy and the views on what should be done with the stockpile and the ways in which wool should be marketed in the future are really extraordinarily diverse. It is very important, before this program is implemented, that everybody has a chance to see it and consider it. It is important that we do not just leave it in the hands of the industry. As the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said, some of their advice in the past has perhaps been the genesis of some of the problems of today.</PARA>
