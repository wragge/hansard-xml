<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's second report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Treaties tabled on 10 and 11 September 1996</EMPHASIS> , together with the minutes of proceedings and the evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OJ4">Mr TAYLOR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This second report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties deals with the group of six treaties which were tabled on 10 and 11 September in both houses. The committee supports the proposed treaty action in each instance. This reflects the non&hyphen;controversial nature of the treaty obligations under review; however, there are four points that I think should be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, we have proposed some simple procedures for tabling future amendments to the international convention on whaling. Unless a contracting state lodges an objection, amendments to this convention automatically come into force 90 days following the date of notification from the secretariat of the International Whaling Commission. If this situation arises, the amendments do not come into effect for any of the contracting governments for an additional 90 days. The practical effect of such a default procedure in this instance is to preclude compliance with the government's new procedures for parliamentary scrutiny of treaties, which prescribe that treaty actions should be tabled in parliament for at least 15 sitting days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion, the proposed amendments were lodged with the President of the Senate on 19 August and tabled in the House of Representatives on 10 September 1996. While the committee appreciates the intention of the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to bring these amendments before the parliament, the following procedures are considered appropriate, should this situation recur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister should write to the committee providing details of the proposed amendments, together with a copy of the national interest analysis, within 10 working days from the date of notification by the secretariat of the IWC. This material should then be tabled at the first opportunity in both houses when parliament sits, along with a brief explanatory note or reference in the NIA outlining the unusual arrangements. The committee considers that adoption of these procedures would allow timely consideration of future amendments to the convention or schedule, as well as ensuring&mdash;this is an important point&mdash;the primacy of the proceedings of both houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, NIAs tabled so far have included general reference to the provisions for denunciation of or withdrawal from treaties. While it has not made a formal recommendation on either matter, the committee believes that it would be assisted in its work if NIAs also included reference to provisions for attaching reservations to treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, in this and its first report, tabled on 9 September, the committee has met its remit from the parliament of 15 sitting days to consider all 31 treaties tabled to date. This has been possible only as the result of the unexceptional nature of most of these treaties and the commitment of committee members to meet a heavy workload in a new and, I might add, very important area of parliamentary scrutiny which satisfies public need and community involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I pointed out in tabling our first report, this is the newest and second largest committee in the parliament. While our first two reports have dealt with treaties which have not generated large public responses, the same cannot be said about the other two ongoing public inquiries we are holding. For example, while the subsidiary agreement with Japan on long line tuna fishing is a relatively minor bilateral player in the overall treaty making processes, public interest and response has nonetheless been significant and has generated a heavy round of committee hearings in Canberra, Hobart, Perth, Adelaide and Port <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Lincoln. This has been a very useful tool in testing the committee's methodology and responsibilities to the parliament, as well as reinforcing the desire of the general public to become involved in national decision&hyphen;making. The committee hopes to table the results of this inquiry next month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the inquiry into the UN  Convention to Combat Desertification, our preliminary public hearing recently has revealed that there are a number of complex issues on the horizon, especially where areas of public policy fall into the states' and territories' legal jurisdiction, in this case land use. The High Court's 1995 Teoh decision is relevant and I have sought advice from both the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) before the committee proceeds further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to my fourth and final point. Tomorrow, another large group of treaties will be tabled, with a number of substantial matters for us to examine. This again raises the issue of the 15 sitting day period available for parliamentary scrutiny. While the committee is not unhappy about the limitations imposed by this period, it would want me to point out that there will be times when the 15 sitting day limit cannot be observed. For example, given the amended sitting pattern for the rest of 1996, it may not be possible for us to report on all of tomorrow's group by 21 November, when the 15 sitting days elapse. I have informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs of this possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While not wishing to pre&hyphen;empt committee deliberations, some of these treaties may become the subject of longer inquiries, requiring government and non&hyphen;government input. I understand that there may be further tablings on 29 October, which tightens the process further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this early stage of the committee's life, it is becoming increasingly clear that our work is the subject of considerable public interest.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a new and lively committee which has its genesis in public concerns about the treaty making process. The committee therefore takes its responsibilities very seriously. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to my colleagues on both sides of this place and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5274"> the other for their hard work and counsel. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Reid)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.37 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not reiterate the points made by the chair, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). Essentially the difficulty was fulfilling the commitment of scrutiny within the 15 sitting day period. The need for national interest analysis to include details of reservations, et cetera, is well taken. I want to briefly talk about aspects of two of these treaties in particular because I think they indicate to the Australian public the reality that whilst we sometimes question Australia's involvement in these conventions and treaties, et cetera, on a wide international scale they are important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a localised parochial front, I commend the finalisation of the air traffic agreement with Malta. Obviously in the electorates of Prospect, Parramatta and Reid, there is a significant Maltese diaspora. They will be pleased with the finalisation of that particular agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, the recent negotiations in whaling highlight some of the difficulties. Firstly, I turn to those relating to aboriginal peoples. Certainly in the Arctic area, the Inuits of Canada, Alaska, the Russian Federation, et cetera, have had traditional rights in regard to customary practices in whaling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the difficulties we find in the need to police this were indicated by the attempt at the last negotiations by the Makah people of Washington state who, after banning the practice for 70 years, attempted to go back into whaling. That was despite the fact that there was evidence that no-one in their community was capable of cutting up the carcasses. As I say, that was based on an 1855 treaty. They had had no involvement in it for 70 years. In the end, America had to abandon its rather hypocritical support for this enlargement, given the fact that America has played a commendable role internationally in regard to whaling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, questions must be raised in regard to the Russian Inuits. They killed 85 whales out of their entitlement of 120 last <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> year with automatic weapons and anti&hyphen;tank weapons. One has to question, although it is a very minor part of international whaling, whether they are always fulfilling traditional practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to indicate the opposition's commendation of the current Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and the line that Australia took at recent negotiations. They include the attempt by Australia to support the United Kingdom and New Zealand in regard to the ban on electric lances; to oppose, as I said earlier, the aboriginal take of whales where it was not based on proof of subsistence need; to call for Norwegian whaling to cease; to oppose strongly the scientific take of Japan, which is just a way of circumventing the international ban on commercial whaling; to promote non&hyphen;lethal research into whaling, in other words, trying to make sure that if we are going to have purported research into whales then it should be of a non&hyphen;lethal type; and to reaffirm the Southern Ocean sanctuary. That was a continuation of policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth briefly touching upon the urgent aspects of the load lines convention. It is worth noting in the 1995 follow up report to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> in regard to international shipping that between 1990 and 1994 there was not a decline of crew lost at sea; there was an increase from 807 people to 1,478. We find that in the period to 1994, 25 per cent of ships coming to our ports had inadequate lifesaving equipment and 21.63 per cent had inadequate firefighting equipment. We find that in 1994, 1,240 ships internationally were withdrawn from their classification and were not reported as scrapped, leading to a continuing international concern that many of these ships are simply changing classification to avoid the requirements of international monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both of these treaties in regard to the requirements of shipping, standards of safety and international whaling demonstrate the need for Australia to remain committed to, involved in and a leading party in negotiations and conventions such as this.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stand to support the comments of the chairman, the honourable member for Groom <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5275"> (Mr Taylor), in tabling the second report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. To date this has been a very active committee and has taken very seriously its obligations and responsibilities to inquire into matters arising from the treaty making process and their national interest analyses and the impact of those upon Australia. It has been very active already in taking submissions and conducting public hearings on a number of treaties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report tabled today contains a summary of the features of a number of treaties tabled on 10 and 11 September and the committee's recommendations regarding these treaties. These include the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, largely routine amendments regarding dates for coming years on catch limits but supporting strongly the international moratorium on commercial whaling. It includes protocols regarding the International Convention on Load Lines and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, refining the process of survey and certification of these conventions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report includes the International Convention on Salvage. This involves updating conventions to achieve international uniformity and providing substantial improvements aimed at environmental protection in the salvage process. It includes the agreement with Canada concerning defence related information. This involves replacing an existing informal agreement and formalising the special arrangement that existed between Australia and Canada in relation to defence information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, the report includes the air services agreement with Malta. This is similar to agreements that Australia has with some 50 other countries and provides for direct passenger and freight services between Australia and Malta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In addition to those treaties included in this report tabled today, the Treaties Committee is actively considering a number of other treaties. Firstly, there is the subsidiary bilateral treaty with Japan, concerning tuna long line fishing. This has been a very active process. Already we have taken a total of 44 submissions, with another 10 supplementary submis sions, and have so far held eight public hearings, with a number of representations from a range of interested groups and departments on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we have begun hearings on the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. A number of submissions have already been taken, and we have had a preliminary public hearing with representatives from a number of interested parties. The interest in both of these issues is indicative of the interest in the whole treaty making process and the importance of this Treaties Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see a very significant role ahead for the Treaties Committee. The resolution to consider public interest and allow broad community consultation with those likely to be affected makes the role of this committee a very responsible one. Also, there is the need to consider the constitutional and legal implications arising from international treaties and our accession to them, which was highlighted as a result of the 1995 Teoh case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of a number of international developments, this committee has a continuing and increasingly significant role. Increased globalisation of the world economy, Australia's increasing role in Asia, the international telecommunications and information technology revolution, the increasing acceptance of the need for multilateral action to address world environmental problems, and greater worldwide pressure on a range of natural resources&mdash;all of these trends and changes will increase the responsibility of those involved in the treaty making process and increase the role of the Treaties Committee. I commend the second report of the Treaties Committee to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak on the second report of the Treaties Committee. It is an excellent committee of which to be a part. It gives you an opening into many facets of our country's activities, where, throughout the world, we are entering treaties with other countries, either together or individually.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5276"> Six treaties are dealt with in this report. The whaling regulations treaty basically deals with the zero catch that we undertake when our industries have gone. It recognises the abo riginal catches throughout the world. We have also highlighted the difficulties, which were put on record by my colleague the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have found interesting in this set of treaties the International Convention on Load Lines, the 1988 protocol. This really deals with the structural strength and stability of ships. There is also the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. Of course, that convention began in about 1914, after the sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> in April 1912.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These treaties go to some of the work that I was involved with in the follow-up report to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>, which was one of the other inquiries in the standing committee on transport in the previous parliaments. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, we dealt with the changing facets of ship making. The evidence that was gathered by that committee in relation to steel was that high tensile is of a thinner nature in relation to construction, especially of bulk carriers. Of course, that steel continued to corrode at about the same rate as other steel, therefore setting up the difficulty of how long ships actually lasted and how long ships stayed at sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other evidence was given in relation to that matter, but it basically went to the need to make sure that throughout the world there were regulations or conventions put in place which allowed people to build ships with similar standards, so that the standards of some of those ships at sea were lifted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The load line convention goes to the position of loading ships. The difficulties arising from that came out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report. Ships were coming into Australian ports and captains could not even submit a loading plan so that the ship could be loaded properly. It is important that the load is spread evenly over a bulk carrier and not put in one particular area, therefore stressing out that ship. Of course, it would have come together later when the ship got to sea and was under bigger pressure. Also, there was the float situation. So this treaty goes to trying to harmonise some of this. It tries to get ship making around the world to have the one view.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another is the International Convention on Salvage. It helps bring together some of the issues that have been found wanting, and where people needed to look at environmental problems during salvage. That will help pull some of those matters together. The other was the treaty of exchange of defence related material, which is an ongoing agreement between us and Canada. Of course, there is the agreement with Malta. It allows them to upgrade their air services via India and Singapore. Overall, I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting these six conventions and the tabling of the report today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure also to rise, following my parliamentary colleagues, in relation to the second report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. It is well to recall the resolution of appointment. The committee is allowed to inquire and report upon:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> matters arising from treaties and related National Interest Analyses and proposed treaty actions presented or deemed to be presented to the Parliament;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> such other matters as may be referred to the committee by the Minister for Affairs and on such conditions as the Minister may prescribe.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Bearing that in mind, it is interesting to reflect on the work of the committee so far. The chairman of the committee, the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), has been a real driving force on this committee. It is an absolute pleasure as a new member to serve with him and to see the way in which he runs this committee. We have certainly been driven hard, but I have enjoyed it immensely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nature of the inquiries that we have conducted so far has been broad. The current inquiries involving the tuna fishing agreement that has been referred to by my colleague the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett) and the more recent and current inquiry in relation to desertification, which is in its embryonic inquiry stages, have been dealt with in a very serious and thoughtful fashion. That is the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5277"> nature of this committee. We are looking at it carefully, we are taking the evidence carefully and we are briefed by a fantastic staff who has supplied the committee with a great briefing background on all of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the current report that has just been tabled by my colleague, the areas that interested me to some degree, probably more than others given my marine background, were the protocols, the load lines convention and the SOLAS convention. It has already been referred to by the member who just resumed his seat, the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), following on from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame </EMPHASIS>inquiry, that both the load lines convention and the related SOLAS convention already provide for certificates in seaworthiness to be carried on board with the ships' documentation. These certificates are subject to scrutiny by Australian officials during port state control inspections. To date, certificates have been issued independently for these conventions. The load lines protocol aims to streamline the process by allowing compliance certificates for both conventions to be issued together. Harmonisation of the certification requirements will simplify inspections and enable consistency of approach with other flag states. Ship owners will benefit because of considerable savings through coordination of the survey requirements for their ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence indicated that the survey procedures would be far better coordinated. Australia has had a very good record. Its surveyors are highly qualified marine engineers and naval architects. Australia can take pride of place in relation to its history of marine survey. It has been a very strict regime. In my view, this convention will aid not only an already good process but in terms of internationalising the sort of expertise that Australia has produced here, this will flow through a little bit further than just Australian shores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend this report. I look forward to continuing with the work of this committee in the great spirit which it has engendered amongst members.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 42nd Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 14&hyphen;25 August 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is a longstanding organisation of parliaments throughout the Commonwealth. It meets on an annual basis in different parts of the world. I had the honour to lead the Australian delegation from the federal parliament in August in Kuala Lumpur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the main conference, there was a meeting of the executive committee. I acted as the alternate delegate at that executive committee meeting. There was also a small countries conference. There are a lot of small countries within the Commonwealth of less than 400,000 people. They hold their own conference in addition to the main conference, dealing with matters that are particularly relevant to many of our smaller Commonwealth neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the small countries conference, the main conference, at which I was joined by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and other delegates from this parliament who will speak after me, we had the general assembly. Apart from the routine business of the general assembly, where things like accounts, publications and all the routine business are dealt with, the most exciting and interesting part was the election of the chairman of the executive committee. Ms Billie Miller from the Caribbean was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5278"> elected as the new chairman of the executive committee for the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a number of plenary sessions. There were women's session and also panel sessions. My colleague who is going to speak after me, the member for Chifley, was one of the panellists. All members of the Australian delegation were able to take part in those various sessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were also pleased to have a speech from the Commonwealth Secretary&hyphen;General. He is a most impressive individual and makes a point of coming to every CPA conference and meeting with the delegates. Up until now, our standing delegate of the executive committee has been Senator Jones. He is no longer in the parliament and I acted in his place on this occasion. The Speaker will become the ongoing delegate for the balance of Senator Jones's three&hyphen;year term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also pleased at the conference, on behalf of the Australian parliament, to offer Australia to act as host at the 2001 conference, which was approved at the general assembly. This country will be hosting the CPA conference in the year 2001. One cannot go to these things without being conscious of the huge effort put in by host countries to CPA conferences, and Malaysia was no different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Malaysian parliament, the Malaysian Speaker was the President of the CPA this year. The Malaysian hosts went to incredible lengths to make all the delegates welcome. They looked after us well: we not only increased our waistlines considerably at all the various formal lunches and dinners but also went out on trips, around the conference period, to learn more about the country&mdash;a very enjoyable and worthwhile exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is important to place on record two sets of thanks: Ms Anne Hazelton, a member of staff in this parliament, came with me to the executive meeting, stayed on through the balance of the conference and provided me with invaluable support in that secretarial role; and Mr Jim Pender, the formal secretary of the delegation, was there throughout the conference and gave his usual incredible support. I would like to thank both of them. Mr Pender went on with me and other mem bers of the delegation on bilateral visits to India and Pakistan, which will be the subject of separate reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next CPA conference will be held in September 1997 in Mauritius. I would just like to very briefly mention that the South African delegation went out of their way to seek contact with the Australian delegation and to urge us to make sure that we developed good bilateral relationships, which I would commend to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, as my time has almost concluded, it seems that formal motions of business at CPA conferences may not be the things that you get the best value from. Where you really get value is from the contacts that you can make around the world in other parliamentary democracies. It was an honour and a privilege for all of us who attended that conference. We look forward to attending many more in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to speak to the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 42nd Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. Prior to the commencement of the conference I was able to make a private visit&mdash;a very hurried visit&mdash;to the Philippines to the city of Cebu. I thought our traffic was pretty bad but it was nothing compared with the traffic when trying to get from Manila airport to the hotel. It was quite an experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that, in going around Cebu, I was able to meet with Mayor Garcia. At the request of our Mayor, Councillor Charlie Lowes of Blacktown city, I proposed to him that there should be a sister city relationship with Cebu. That actually followed up an initiative between our respective chambers of commerce. I am hopeful that that will come to pass early next year. I then travelled on to Malaysia for the formal part of the conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank the previous speaker, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), for his role as leader of the delegation. I would also like to commend Jim Pender, the secretary of the delegation, and Anne Hazelton, who was there as well, for their typical efficiency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, indeed. I regret to report to you specifically that I got into a bit of trouble when I was suggesting the difficulty in trying to define terrorism. People who we would know today for having made an outstanding contribution towards peace have, at various times during their careers, been referred to as terrorists: for example, Yasser Arafat&mdash;who would doubt his commitment to the peace process in the Middle East; almost a beacon these days&mdash;and Nelson Mandela, the President of the South African republic. Some of my fellow delegates from South Africa took umbrage at it. It gives me an opportunity to repeat that I have the highest regard for Nelson Mandela. His career is an inspiration to us all. We all hope that he has a very long and fruitful life. But it does remain that, for periods, he was labelled a terrorist.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House wishes the visiting Members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council the very best in their endeavours to continue the democratic process in Hong Kong after their unification with China next year.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, although it is not pertinent to this motion, I extend my own&mdash;and, I am sure, that of all members of the parliament&mdash;deepest sympathy to the relatives of Theodore Miriung of the Bougainville province of Papua New Guinea. I knew him, had met him, and feel that it is a very sad indictment of the peace process. I wish everybody in Papua New Guinea well as they try to recover from what has been a disastrous impact on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I now return to the subject of this motion, notice of which was given by the honourable member for O'Connor, Mr Wilson Tuckey, who asked that I take it in his stead. I understand Wilson is Chair of the Parliamentary Friendship Association with Hong Kong. Unfortunately, he cannot be here today. In opening, I want to express his apologies for not being able to take the motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subject of the motion is a matter of great concern, not peculiarly to Australia but to people in this region. We have all been conscious of the economic growth and changes right throughout Asia, not uniquely in Hong Kong, although Hong Kong has certainly been one of the tigers of this part of the world. As the people of Hong Kong have achieved economic advancement, they have slowly moved from what was for so many years&mdash;99 years this year&mdash;a very dominating colonial regime to one where the views of the people of Hong Kong have been allowed expression, through the introduction of a form of democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there are many aspects to democracy, for us all democracy really means the rights of individuals to express their own concerns, their own attitudes to public issues, their own ability to express concern about the way of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5280"> life, and for them to be registered as having that right. It does not mean that people need to agree with them. In the same way that I do not agree with the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) but will defend to the death the fact that she has the right to express those points of view&mdash;so, too, in Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I trust that, after 1 July 1997, when the democracy that is in Hong Kong appears to be threatened by the incoming Chinese administration, there will be recognition that the people of China have a great deal to benefit by allowing the views of individual citizens of Hong Kong to be expressed. They should not be suppressed; they should be promoted. There are several aspects to that. I want to come to them in relation to what I see as an important benchmark of progress that will be seen by the world as to where Asia goes from here after 1 July next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the world will join with the people of China in what is, without doubt, a remarkable step in transition from a colonial regime to the re&hyphen;incorporation of Hong Kong into China itself. Those of you who have been to Beijing recently will know that on the side of Tiananmen Square there is a clock which ticks away and shows the moments passing towards 30 June next year and the incorporation of Hong Kong into China. It is natural that the people of China feel an enormous exultation at the prospect of change. We all commend them for that and recognise the significance of that transition. This motion is really directed to some of the processes that we hope will continue in spite of our recognition of their exultation. We hope that, after 1 July next year, there will be a recognition of what has made Hong Kong so special.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I started by referring to economic development. Hong Kong has been not a Western city but very much a Chinese city over the 99 years of colonial administration. The population is predominantly Chinese, the attitudes and aspirations are essentially Chinese and, of course, commerce is essentially Chinese. If you look at one of the criteria for determining the Chinese character of the city and the state, it is no more apparent than in the fact that so much of the economy is now at the service end of the spectrum, with manufacturing and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> much of the actual operations being done on mainland China. Of course, Hong Kong has always been a port for southern China&mdash;for Guangdong and the provinces of the south&mdash;and it will continue to be so. It is certainly going to be a very important entrepot port. As I understand, something like 86 per cent of its economy revolves around service industries, much of which relate to China itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, what is important is looking at these benchmarks&mdash;as one might call them&mdash;about where Hong Kong goes after 1 July next year. In doing so, a few appear to me to be particularly important. One of my concerns, as I explained to a number of representatives of the Chinese government in Hong Kong about 10 days ago, is that I believe that it would be unfortunate if they set up a provisional legislature which pre&hyphen;empts the right of those elected as members of the Legislative Council to continue to have their say. I would hope that, if the Chinese government wants to change the legislature, they do so by protecting those geographic electorates which are the basis of the present legislature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing wrong in democracy, and the Chinese need to remember that they will still be in the position of controlling government. At the moment, the legislature does not operate as this legislature does. The members of government are apart from the legislature itself. Martin Lee and his colleagues won a significant majority, something over 60 per cent in the seat, but Martin Lee and his colleagues do not form government. The British colonial administration, through Governor Chris Patten, still administers the state of Hong Kong. After 1 July next year, it is recognised, the people of Hong Kong will be subjected to the government of China. But through the basic law, with the exception of foreign affairs and defence policy, which will revert to China, other policies should and must remain within Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern that we have lies in a number of criteria which I call the benchmarks. One is the freedom of the press. The Fourth Estate is absolutely vital to society. There has to be a capacity for the media to comment without fear or favour. That does not mean that we all agree with the media. Goodness only knows, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5281"> in this place I think we have more vociferous critics of the media than anywhere else in Australia. The media plays a vital role in a free society, and the people of China should not feel apprehensive about having a free press in Hong Kong. It is going to be very important that the freedom of the press is preserved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second criterion, which is equally important, is the impartiality of the processes of law. The rule of law is tremendously important in all our societies. I know people in Asia are apprehensive that, when we talk about human rights and about the rights of the individual, in some way we are saying to them, `You can't proceed under your system of government administration of law.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we do have differences with many countries of Asia about the way in which law is administered, it is critical that people in China understand that the system in Hong Kong works and is effective. It is not just in its administration; it is also in the Hong Kong constabulary. The Hong Kong police force has an enviable reputation. I trust that it is not going to be fiddled with in any way. It is not just the law and the impartiality of law that are the benchmarks; the Hong Kong constabulary is going to be one of these benchmarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would hope that, in the nature of the administration of law, with one of the present members of the judiciary and a former chief judge being spoken of as future chief executives, in no way will their suggested appointment as chief executive impinge on their continued ability to act impartially. One does not want to see the offer of favours in any way transgressing the continued undoubted high impartiality the courts of Hong Kong have traditionally exercised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other benchmark, and probably the most important, is the maintenance of some form of elected legislature. That is what this motion refers to&mdash;an elected legislature. The government will be appointed by China. But the success and the efficacy of the government itself is going to be judged by its ability to preserve that criterion of selection through a process of electing people. Democracy is not a process the people of China or the government of China should fear. It is very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important that that elected legislature, which is functioning so effectively in Hong Kong at the moment, be protected and preserved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I very much commend this motion to the House. I say to the Chinese government that the continuation of the democratic process in Hong Kong after 1 July next year is one of the barometers of their future perceived success. We all wish them well in that transition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak in support of the motion moved by the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) on behalf of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). As I know all members of this House are aware, our ties with Hong Kong are a very important part of our nation's engagement in the Asia-Pacific region. Hong Kong is, after all, our 10th largest trading partner, our eighth largest export market and our 18th largest source of imports&mdash;two-way trade in 1995 was $A3.9 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hong Kong is a major base for Australians doing business in the wider China market, with more than 350 companies based in Hong Kong and more than 1,000 companies having representative offices there. Thousands of Hong Kong people have chosen to make Australia their home. Over 30,000 Australians live and work there. A quarter of a million Australians visit Hong Kong each year and Hong Kong is Australia's ninth largest source of tourists, with more than 132,000 visiting Australia in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is against this background and with our considerable commercial and consular links in Hong Kong that I state today that Australia has a very significant stake in a smooth and successful transfer to Chinese sovereignty from 1 July 1997. Central to this is the maintenance of a high degree of autonomy and the freedoms guaranteed to Hong Kong under the joint declaration and the basic law&mdash;that is, the continuation of the rule of law, an independent judiciary, the maintenance of democratically elected institutions, a free media and the continuation of Hong Kong's free and open economic system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that China's commitment under the joint declaration and the basic law <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5282"> should provide a solid foundation for a continuation of Hong Kong's prosperity and, indeed, its way of life. China's commitment to a one-country, two-system formula for Hong Kong is certainly an undertaking of tremendous significance. The formula promises that Hong Kong's way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years. It should allow Hong Kong and, indeed, the international business community to plan for the future with real confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The international community will be looking very closely at the process of transition, both before and after July 1997. The stakes for China, for Hong Kong and, indeed, for the whole of the Asia-Pacific region are very high. The challenge for the international community and for Australia in particular will be to do all that we can to support a smooth and successful transition. In this regard we must recognise that it is China that faces the great challenge and that it is in everyone's interest to see that China succeeds in meeting that challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's response to developments will need to be balanced, constructive and not driven by newspaper headlines but instead by mature consideration of the underlying political dynamics&mdash;the dynamics both in Hong Kong and China itself. That said, there should be absolutely no weakening of Australia's support for both democratic processes and human rights in Hong Kong. Australia should be prepared to use all appropriate means, public and private, to leave China and the international community in no doubt about our strong support for the continuation of democratic processes in respect of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard, I must again express my continued concern about the Howard government's laissez faire approach to the protection and promotion of human rights. The latest evidence of that was provided in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> last Friday when it reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) believes that Australia must be less outspoken on human rights abuses in the Asia-Pacific region and that public criticism will be reserved for what the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government deems to be major abuses, such as the shooting of peaceful protesters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, I must say, a 180-degree reversal from the position taken by Mr Downer when, as shadow minister, he accused the then Labor government of going soft on regional human rights abuses. The minister would do well, I think, to recall his own words on 4 April last year. In his first speech as shadow minister for foreign affairs, he declared:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important feature of any human rights policy is consistency . . . We cannot simply speak with a loud voice when injustice occurs on the other side of the world, whilst whispering softly or remaining silent when similar events take place within our own region.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister is reported as desiring a community debate on Australia's human rights stance. I can assure him that he will encounter considerable public debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meanwhile, he would do well to consider the implications of his approach for Australia's support for democratic institutions and processes in Hong Kong. Will the government remain silent if those institutions and processes come under fire? All members of this House would be most interested, as indeed would be the people of Australia and Hong Kong, to learn how the minister proposes to put his softly, softly approach to human rights into practice. I cannot believe that such an approach would serve either the cause of justice or Australia's long-term interests.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend this motion to the House, and I would like to give a quick summation of where Hong Kong has come from, where it is at and where it is going because, obviously, one chapter in this colony is closing as another is opening. Just like when the Union Jack was taken down from Australia's shores at the beginning of this century, so too will it happen in Hong Kong on 30 June 1997. Indeed, the five&hyphen;star flag of China will reign over that colony.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look back at the 155 years of history of what was a British colony&mdash;a very small island until the acquisition of Kowloon and the new territories in 1897. It is a small colony of only 420 square kilometres yet, with a population now of 6.3 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5283"> million people, it is the eighth largest trading nation on this planet. It is the busiest container port of any seaport on the earth and, also, it will have the No. 1 airport after the construction of the new airport in Hong Kong. Ironically, it now has a higher per capita income than Australia, the UK or the United States&mdash;$24,000. It has over $60 billion in foreign reserves, with an unemployment rate of 3.2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in many ways it is the envy of other newly industrialised countries, NICs, and it is certainly the envy of those in our area. We should take note from it, because Australia does have an interest not just in the transition period until it will be incorporated into mainland China, but also in the significant investment that exists in Hong Kong&mdash;Australia's investment in Hong Kong&mdash;and in Hong Kong's investment in our country. Indeed, investment by Hong Kong nationals in Australia totals $14 billion, which makes it the fourth largest investor in Australia after the United States, the UK and Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look the other way, Australia is a major investor and has major capital assets in Hong Kong. After the United States, the UK, New Zealand, Japan and the Russian federation, we have over $3.2 billion worth of hard assets in Hong Kong. So it is very important for Australia's interests, as well as the interests of regional security, that we maintain that asset base. Certainly Hong Kong is also a major contributor to our economy. Over 3.5 per cent of our total tourist visitations to Australia are from Hong Kong. Over 131,000 visit Australia. Many of them visit the Gold Coast and places near my electorate, the electorate of Richmond. Indeed, we have a very broad education system in which we are educating many of the future leaders of that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To China it is also critically important that this transition period work correctly. Over 65 per cent of all foreign investment that goes to mainland China goes through the gateway of Hong Kong. Indeed, mainland China has over $45 billion worth of investments in Hong Kong. So, aside from the political and national sovereignty issue, there is an economic issue here both for Hong Kong and for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> world. Hong Kong really is the envy of many countries. As the internationally recognised Heritage Foundation said, `It is the one truly regulated, transparent economy in the world.' It has low taxes, a highly educated work force and highly motivated people. It is highly industrious. So we certainly do not want these gains squandered in any transition period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously the foundation for this transition period was laid in 1984, with the Sino&hyphen;British joint declaration. Of course, the Special Administrative Region which was established will come into place on 30 June 1997, lasting for 50 years. It is those first critical years, no doubt, which will be very important to the current legislators of Hong Kong and to the people of Hong Kong to ensure that there is an adequate flow of democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst we recognise that foreign affairs and defence certainly will be controlled from Beijing, there does have to be that autonomy so the one country, two-system state operates effectively. Obviously that is ruled through the basic law. I believe it is very important that there is this high degree of autonomy: that there is a separate executive, legislature and judiciary and, as the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said, a preservation of the Fourth Estate, where media have freedom of expression. I hope we do not see a situation where there is censorship happening in that country, because it is one of the three true bastions&mdash;capitalism, free trade and free thought. I commend that China does go through a recognition phase where those legislative areas and those boundaries in Hong Kong are recognised, because this will be a signal to the rest of the world. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

If my memory serves me correctly, Theodore came to us late last year to discuss progress of the transitional government and the peace arrangements. It has been a great tragedy for the people of Bougainville and, I think, for lasting peace there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are speaking to the motion moved by Mr Tuckey, which states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5284">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House wishes the visiting Members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council the very best in their endeavours to continue the democratic process in Hong Kong after their unification with China next year.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I guess all too often the Australian people do not take note of the times when members on both sides of the House, including the Independents, agree about a particular proposition. So I can say quite frankly that there is nothing in the contribution of the honourable member for New England and the contribution of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) that I would disagree with at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Paramount Leader of China in the 1980s, Deng Xiaoping, pledged that China and Hong Kong would be one country and two systems. I guess that the theme and the sentiments of most speakers today is going to be that respecting and encouraging rights and the democratic process in Hong Kong will not constitute a threat to China but in fact strengthen the relationship between Hong Kong and China and that, although the colony has existed for 155 years and only recently has there been an election, the continuation of a democratically elected council will serve the interests of both Hong Kong and China very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is regrettable, when we talk about things like human rights or the democratic processes in our region, that too often the argument is made that countries cannot afford these things because of the need for economic growth. I have never understood how democracy is a hindrance to the growth of a country. I have never understood how the rule of law can somehow slow down the economic growth of a country. In fact, the reverse is quite the case. Inappropriate law or underdeveloped law often hinders economic development, and I could name a number of countries and examples where that is the case. The rule of law, democratic elections and a free press are all fundamental ingredients for a country to be well based and founded on human rights but will not hinder the spectacular growth of Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a real irony, I suppose, that 155 years ago Lord Palmerston said that Hong Kong was merely a barren rock with hardly a house <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> upon it. Now it is a thriving country of some six million people. Some people do not like visiting Hong Kong. I have always liked going to Hong Kong. There is a certain dynamism and industry about Hong Kong that you either like or do not like. I happen to be one of those that like it very much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the previous speakers have mentioned, much of Hong Kong's industry is now service based where previously it was manufacturing based. Indeed, mainland China now has much of the manufacturing. Already they are entwined economically and operating cooperatively in the interests of both countries. I sincerely hope that, on 1 July next year, that will continue, with Hong Kong's democratic institutions thriving, developing and growing. I think all Australians would support that proposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I thank the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) for moving this motion on behalf of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). The right honourable member for New England, of course, is the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which is at present conducting an inquiry into Hong Kong's transfer to Chinese sovereignty. During the recent visit of the Hong Kong Legislative Council members to Australia&mdash;the first visit made by members of the council to Australia&mdash;an interest was registered by council members in making a submission to the committee, on behalf of the Legislative Council, in relation to that inquiry. I am looking forward to the opportunity that that will present for Australians to hear first&hyphen;hand and in a detailed way the concerns and some of the views of Legislative Council members on the transitional period. In private conversation and at the function that I was able to attend with them, it was interesting to learn first&hyphen;hand&mdash;I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, yourself were there&mdash;of some of the interests and concerns which were registered in discussion about the transition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former resident of Hong Kong, back in 1967 when I lived there&mdash;although I was a child at the time&mdash;the prospect of the resumption seemed such a long way away that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5285"> it was almost way over the horizon. At that stage it was 30 years away, and we are now within months of that event taking place. As other speakers have pointed out, Hong Kong is now an extremely important region within the Asia&hyphen;Pacific area in economic and social terms. Hong Kong will not cease to retain this importance after reunification. I know that this is recognised by many nations throughout the world including, of course, the PRC. This fact is also well understood within Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1984 Britain and China came to an agreement for the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China. There was a joint declaration providing for Hong Kong to become a special administrative region of China and providing the basic law for Hong Kong over the next 50 years. There is some satisfaction that there has been able to be agreement between Britain and China. That has continued to a certain extent since this joint declaration, although in more recent times&mdash;particularly since the Tiananmen Square massacre and other events&mdash;substantial concerns have been raised within and without Hong Kong as to how this transaction will work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This translation will obviously not be without its problems. In fact, it is widely accepted that this will be a unique historical event. The Chinese social and political system will absorb a quite different common law system based on the British form of legislature, judiciary and colonial constitution. The key to this process will be the degree to which China's leaders understand and acknowledge the real contribution that this system has made to the prosperity of Hong Kong. A point was raised by my colleague the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) when he said that this is prosperity which no doubt China wants to benefit from and, of course, in time emulate&mdash;although in certain regions of China there is already some emulation of this rapid growth and high degree of capitalist endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hong Kong is a well developed dynamic economy which is in strong growth, and it has a deepening economic relationship with China. It has a growing and prosperous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> middle class and a well&hyphen;educated work force. We have seen major structural change away from manufacturing to service industries, which has seen the government put a premium on the development of human resources through training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, may I point out that some of the concerns revolve around the way in which the law will work within the context of the transition to reunification: in particular, the change in one small area, the administration of the civil law, from the Hong Kong police to, effectively, the army.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> notes that arrangements under which pensioners and other concession cards holders can use public transport concession cards outside their home State vary considerably from State to State;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> acknowledges that this causes considerable confusion and embarrassment, particularly when card holders innocently seek concessions to which they are not entitled; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> calls on the Australian Government and all State and Territory Governments to develop a uniform reciprocal rights arrangement which ensures that transport concession rules are the same for pensioners and other concession card holders across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion relates to an issue of considerable importance to Australian pensioners in particular. The broad thrust of this motion is, firstly, to note that under existing arrangements pensioners and other concession cardholders can use their public transport concession cards outside their own states only in very limited circumstances, and these circumstances vary considerably from state to state. Secondly, it acknowledges that sometimes this causes substantial confusion and embarrassment on the part of concession cardholders. Thirdly, it calls on the Australian government and the state and territory govern <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5286"> ments to work together to develop some sort of uniform framework within which reciprocal rights can be recognised for transport concession cardholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this is an issue of considerable importance, particularly to pensioners. All pensioners are entitled to intrastate transport concessions within their own states, and they vary to some extent, but when they are interstate&mdash;when they are outside their home state&mdash;their entitlement to concession treatment on public transport varies considerably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To begin with, there are different concessions in different states. For example, the pensioner concessions in New South Wales are significantly more generous than they are in Victoria. There is only one example of reciprocal recognition of concession cards and that is between Victoria and New South Wales. Those people with Victorian cards are entitled to concessions on the New South Wales network and vice versa but, other than that, there is no example of reciprocal recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the interaction between our interstate transport networks, the lack of uniform concession entitlements and the lack of reciprocal recognition, we end up with some rather peculiar anomalies. For example, it is possible for an Adelaide resident to take a trip from Adelaide all the way to Albury on a concession card, if they are entitled to that card, but, if they are going to Bendigo, they are unable to do so. Once they get off the main interstate line at Melbourne, the remainder of the trip from Melbourne to Bendigo has to be taken on a full fare. Generally speaking, it is permissible for concession cardholders to extract concessions on the main interstate lines, but it is what happens within the individual states they are visiting, other than their own home state, where problems arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some other examples which illustrate the anomalies. A concession cardholder who hails from Melbourne can get a concession fare travelling from Bathurst to Sydney, but cannot get a concession fare travelling from Bunbury to Perth. A South Australian pensioner travelling from Adelaide to Bendigo, as I indicated, can only get the concession for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> part of the way whereas, if they are going to Wangaratta, they can get it for the whole way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although most pensioners and cardholders are not well off by definition and appreciate every extra concession, the money is not the key issue. This is not just a concern about an extra few dollars for people or making transport interstate more accessible; there are also some practical concerns that are of significance to people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One concern is the embarrassment and confusion. It is a common experience and is one that has been reported to me and one that is often reported to the pensioner and superannuant organisations. People do not know the rules, do not know precisely what they are not entitled to when they are interstate, and present their concession cards only to be told they are not eligible for the concessions. In some instances, they are almost treated as being fare evaders. People can be without the correct money because they have made an incorrect assumption that they will be entitled to a concession. People can find it difficult to plan trips as a result of the complexity of the circumstances that face them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue which has emerged largely as a result of growing mobility in the Australian population. Some years ago, most pensioners would have travelled interstate fairly rarely. It is much more common these days for people to travel interstate. What is particularly important in this issue is the fact that many older people in our community have children who have moved interstate and they wish to be able to visit them. They often have more time on their hands to be able to visit and stay with their children who are still in the work force and who find it difficult to come to them. Yet, in order to do so, they have to travel into another state where, in the transport system in that state, they are unable to get concession entitlements for their fares&mdash;the same concession entitlements that they can get within their home state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, this has become a substantial issue largely because of changes in the structure of our society and our population and the greater mobility that all of us benefit from within our community. Governments of all persuasions have not addressed the issue. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5287"> should emphasise that in raising this issue&mdash;and I hope the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) treats the discussion in the same way&mdash;I am seeking to criticise neither the current federal government nor any state government, nor indeed my own former government. It is an issue that has grown gradually. It is now appropriate for the federal government to take a lead on this, but it has to take a lead very much with the view of the state governments being a primary source of a solution to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is yet another example of how our federal structures are rapidly becoming obsolete and need radical reform because of the changes in our society and the much greater mobility and greater communication across the state boundaries. It is complicated to deal with as an issue because it is not a situation where there is equality between the states. Obviously, there are different concession entitlements and different concession levels in different states. There are different levels of population in different states, and there are different movement patterns. Obviously, a much higher proportion of pension concession holders are likely to go to Queensland from their home state than, for example, to South Australia because Queensland is a much more tourism dominated economy and is much more likely to have those sorts of movement patterns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the future, the ability to solve this problem may emerge from smart cards because every single transaction on a public transport network will be fed into a computer. It will be fairly easy to distil out particular transactions that ultimately may be paid for by one state to another, to total them all up, to do a reconciliation and to work out which state needs to pay which state so much money over a financial year. But, for the time being, we must rely on manual systems. That makes it difficult and it does add to the potential cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, the administrative cost would be significant because each state would bear an additional cost due to the spread of the concession. I doubt whether it would be enormous, though. It is certainly something that needs to be explored. It is certainly well within the ambit of existing arrangements <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> within the state public transport systems to record claims for concession cardholders from interstate and to do a reconciliation across the states at the end of the financial year so one state pays or receives the difference in order to balance across all the states.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a matter of great public importance to the Australian community: the fact that the tardy and belated resignation of the former Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, has no doubt exacerbated the problems of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), of his own making, in that he has failed to apply his own ministerial standards. I say that because the resignation should have occurred last Wednesday or last Thursday at the latest. The Prime Minister should have demanded it but he failed to act. The Prime Minister is fast gaining a reputation for becoming a follower and not a leader.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the particular instance, and in other instances of like matter, the Prime Minister has dithered and, I am sure, will continue to dither on instances that relate both to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and to Senator Gibson, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. The Prime Minister has failed to apply his own parliamentary standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short's retention of thousands of ANZ Bank shares demanded his resignation on two counts. Firstly, his breach of the standards was plain and, secondly, the Prime Minister's requirement that Senate Short divest himself of thousands of shares upon becoming a minister was also equally plain, and he failed to do it. The former Assistant Treasurer conceded the breach last week yet failed to tender his resignation. More importantly, had the Prime Minister failed to seek his resignation it would have been an act <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5288"> verging on the absurd.

How on earth can someone who is in the same political party as the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) have the audacity to say that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has, in fact, fallen short of the standards that one would expect of the leader of this country?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is that Senator Short has acted with absolute propriety. He failed to resign last week for the reasons that were outlined at the time. He resigned over the weekend when he discovered additional information. The comparison with the proper and ethical conduct of the former Assistant Treasurer is very stark when one looks at this headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper which outlines that the honourable member for Fremantle lied to the Western Australian parliament and the Western Australian people. We have still, on the front bench opposite, someone who was found by a royal commission to have lied to the public. She clung to her ministerial seat; she refused to go.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The clear message being sent to the people of western Sydney, particularly in the electorate of Lindsay, is, `Don't be underprivileged and need dental health care'. That is what is coming out very clearly following the scrapping in the budget of the Commonwealth dental health program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe one of the marks of a civilised society is that we should be looking after our underprivileged, especially when they are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sick. When we cut out this program in the budget, what we are saying to those people is that we are going back to the bad old days where, prior to 1993, if you did not have the money to go to the dentist, you waited for anything up to five years. The message is coming over very clearly now in western Sydney, particularly from the pensioners, particularly from people on single incomes, that they are going to voice that concern come the by&hyphen;election on Saturday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my area alone some 1,700 pensioners are waiting for dentures. In Fairfield, they have to wait something like 18 months before they are going to be seen. Continually, my office is inundated by people saying, `Where do we go from here? Who is going to assist me? Who is going to help me?' I did some estimates of an average trip to a dentist: just for an examination&mdash;a clean and filling&mdash;it will cost roughly $168. It is all very well for people to say `So what?' but, if you are a pensioner or if you are on very limited income, where are you going to get that money? You cannot just go out and find $168.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are going to see, Mr Deputy Speaker, particularly in western Sydney, and particularly in areas like Penrith in the Lindsay electorate, is that come the day when the people do not have the money to go to the dentist, when they finally get the treatment they will have their teeth removed rather than have their teeth cared for. I believe that this government in their small&hyphen;minded cutting back of the budget should rethink these things. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an unusual matter this afternoon. Earlier this year, the Anton Breinl Centre at James Cook University, Townsville, presented me with details of a study into how teenagers view their bodies with respect to their weight. The study found, with little surprise, that 12&hyphen; to 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old North Queensland students are obsessed with their weight. Of about 800 students surveyed, about half of the girls and one&hyphen;fifth of the boys had tried to lose weight during the previous year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the study's head dietitian, Madeleine Nowak, only 41 per cent of girls <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5289"> and 45 per cent of boys surveyed were satisfied with their weight, with about half the girls and a quarter of the boys wanting to lose weight. On the other side of the coin, only one&hyphen;fifth of the boys and only one&hyphen;tenth of the girls wanted to gain weight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from this study that the diet habit already exists at the beginning of the high school years. For growing children aged around 12 to 14 years, dieting is not a healthy option. As head of the Anton Breinl Centre, Professor Ian Wronski, told me at the time of the study's release, the sensible solution to weight control is eating properly and regular exercise&mdash;not dieting. The last thing our younger children need to be developing is some sort of culture of weight loss. This problem should be of serious concern to the community and to both the state and federal governments.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Presently, farmers in the Geelong region are facing an agricultural epidemic in the form of serrated tussock, a problem with potential comparable to the rabbit plague in Australia. The tussock is a weed which livestock cannot eat and digest. It has the capacity to destroy entire farms and cause considerable damage to neighbouring land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two weeks ago I inspected the Inverleigh&hyphen;Barabool area, with a number of concerned local landowners, to see first-hand the problem of serrated tussock and discuss strategies to combat the spread of this potential agricultural disaster. Serrated tussock spreads and regenerates through its millions of tiny seeds with alarming success. Seeds can travel in the wind for up to 20 kilometres at a time infesting previously unaffected pasture. It can also travel when hay or livestock are transported. Methods of control include spraying with Frenic, which is prohibitively expensive, or digging out the weed and planting perennials. It is particularly difficult to control by virtue of some of the rocky, inaccessible areas where the seed can settle. It is also a problem which requires a cooperative effort by landowners: it is no good one farmer spraying or hoeing out the weed if those nearby are allowing the seed to spread with impunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an issue which will challenge farmers, local communities and state and federal governments in the quest for real and lasting solutions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question. I know that he has a deep and abiding interest in many of these issues. The government was shocked and saddened at the assassination of Theodore Miriung on 12 October. He was assassinated, we understand, in the southern part of Bougainville. We send our deepest condolences to his family and, of course, to the people of Papua New Guinea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government condemns in the strongest possible terms this latest unconscionable act of violence on Bougainville. Mr Miriung was a man of compassion and of humanity, as many in this House would know, who was committed to the pursuit of a peaceful resolution of the eight-year&hyphen;old conflict on Bougainville. With the loss of this courageous and influential figure, peace on Bougainville will regrettably become all the more difficult to achieve. Indeed, we hope that this death will not lead to further violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Miriung was last in Australia for the two rounds of Bougainville peace talks which were held in Cairns at the end of last year. He played an important role in the progress that was made in those meetings. The most fitting memorial to Theodore Miriung would be an early end to the Bougainville conflict and a lasting peace on that unfortunate island. The Australian government stands ready to play its part in helping Papua New Guinea to bring this about, including through an increased focus on Bougainville in our aid programs. As I said, we deeply regret the death of Theodore Miriung. We will continue to do all we can to assist with the peace process in Bougainville.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I wonder whether the Treasurer of the day injuncted all members of the cabinet to look to the interests of themselves and any members of their family in relation to ownership of bank shares. The former finance minister might know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as your former Prime Minister believed that it was okay for a parliamentary secretary not having specific responsibility for the administration of banking legislation to retain ownership of those shares, so it is that I do not believe Senator Gibson was in breach of the guidelines because he was not assigned specific responsibility for banking legislation. For more abundant caution he has sold those shares. But I do not concede that in relation to the allegation you have made he was in breach of the guidelines.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Beyond the matters that were raised last night, the fact of the matter is that we have had a number of other similar concerns raised in the public debate in recent times. For example, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia is currently investigating allegations of ballot tampering in the TWU New South Wales branch, purportedly involving something like 2,500 votes. Investigations are also being carried out into a May 1996 AWU ballot regarding the accuracy of the roll of the voters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the CPU matter raised on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>, I did raise this matter, when I was the shadow spokesman, with the then Minister for Justice. I sought a reopening of the investigation that the Australian Federal Police had actually closed. I was then advised that the minister had been informed that to reopen the investigation would be contrary to the prosecutions policy of the Commonwealth. In a personal explanation to the House, the minister explained that he did not himself make a decision that the investigation should not be pursued. Instead, he had conveyed to me the Federal Police's advice to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I told the House earlier this year, in my view it was appropriate that further action could have been taken at that time. In the intervening time, the government has shown the sort of action we believe should have been taken earlier. I have written to my colleagues who have relevant portfolio responsibilities seeking their views on what remedial action might be taken in relation to this particular case and to prevent, as far as possible, its possible repetition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Administrative Services had in August raised the issue of union elections and has now referred this specific <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concern to the parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The minister's terms of reference for that committee require it to examine the role of the Electoral Commission in conducting industrial elections, including mechanisms for the review of the conduct and integrity of industrial elections. This will allow the committee to probe the circumstances of the election on which the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> case was last night reported. The commissioner of the AFP has also advised the government that, in view of the court's judgment, the AFP is currently reviewing the matter and its role in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, I must say that I am not satisfied that the existing penalty regime applying to ballot rigging is effective. The government does intend to review these with a view to financial sanctions being strengthened against those who commit these offences. The reality is that anybody who saw the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program last night can only conclude that the previous government basically turned a blind eye to these matters. This government believes that that is not satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Union members are entitled to a fair go. If they are voting in a ballot, they are entitled to know that the thing has not been rigged by some within the trade union movement. We intend to have fair elections in the trade union movement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. All honourable members would be aware that the government has moved to sell long-term leases in respect of the operation of airports in Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne. Expressions of interest were called for. The time for expressions of interest closed at 4.00 p.m. last Thursday. I am pleased to tell the House that at that time 26 expressions of interest had been received in respect of the three airports. Those expressions of interest will be evaluated against the government's objectives for the sale of those airports and, ultimately, certain numbers of bidders will progress to stage two. That list will be drawn up shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To specifically address the honourable member's question, last Friday I saw a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> entitled `Airport bidding going sky high'. That report indicated that the formula of price, price, price might be used by the government to determine the successful bidder in order to meet the deficit reduction promises of the government. We have an absolute commitment to returning the budget to balance and ending an era of dependency on deficit and debt under Labor and to ignore the proceeds of asset sales in order to meet this commitment&mdash;in other words, to always report the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> budget deficit or surplus in terms of the underlying figure, not the headline. We have taken asset sales out of the bottom line. It was the policy of the former government to disguise the fact that it was continually running up the deficit by running down the asset base and it was the former government which was entirely captivated by price, price, price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the former Minister for Finance talked up the many benefits of privatisation&mdash;I note that he made a speech to the National Press Club in 1994 about the benefits of privatisation&mdash;he did not talk about the principal attraction of privatisation for the Labor Party. It allowed them to hide the extent of their dependency on debt because they focused on the headline budgeted outcome, not the underlying figure. I repeat: we are divesting ourselves of assets which would be better run by the private sector, but the proceeds of those sales will not be used to try to mask our financial position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have continually emphasised that price will be only one of the factors to be taken into consideration in the bids lodged for the long-term leases of the airports. The government will have to be satisfied that the successful bidders have the capacity to manage the airports and the commitment to the communities that these airports currently serve and to do so in accordance with Commonwealth law and following full consultation with the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me assure the House that the government is committed to ensuring that future operators of the airports will have as their sole focus the successful operation of the airports. Price will be one of the most important factors to be taken into consideration, but bidders will also have to prove their depth of experience and their commitment to the region that they are serving.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get the question asked if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not have the courage to come up here and ask it! On Saturday, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  published an article by Diane Stott, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5299"> with a picture of my wife underneath, which said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Treasurer's entry in the parliamentary register, tabled on Wednesday, reveals that she holds shares in the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, you would be aware that the parliamentary register, far from being tabled in this parliament on Wednesday of last week, was tabled on 25 June, some 3&half; to four months ago. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Sun</EMPHASIS> &mdash;I didn't check the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> &mdash;published the next day, on 26 June, from that declaration and in the course of that it disclosed, as I had disclosed, that my wife owned shares in Woolworths and the Commonwealth Bank. It also disclosed that I owned a property in Blairgowrie and that I had been a guest of Hudson Conway at an Olympic dinner. I would like to table that article, Mr Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was not the first disclosure of that shareholding. It was disclosed back in March 1994 after my wife purchased shares in the Commonwealth Bank and in Woolworths. She purchased $2,000 worth of shares in the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;I think it is 200 shares&mdash;and she purchased $2,000 worth of shares in Woolworths&mdash;I think at the time it was about 800 shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it entirely clear: throughout the course of our marriage and after looking after three children, my wife has held down part&hyphen;time employment. Those share purchases were made out of the money that she has earned. They were her own purchases and she told me after the event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ministerial guidelines have certain requirements as to shareholding by ministers. They do not say that wives should be divested of property; indeed, how could I divest my wife of her property? My wife is entitled to hold down a job, which she has at great personal cost. She is entitled to earn income and she is entitled, under those guidelines, to buy shares. That is exactly what she has done and I will defend her right and the right of any married woman to do that, absolutely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Saturday, the member for Holt came out and, in order to appeal to the sisterhood and the feminist wing of the Labor Party, said that spouses are entitled to careers, to interests, to lives of their own, without being prisoners of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their husbands' political ambition, and vice versa. That is what you said and everything you have done since has been to try to negate that principle. You have been sliding around without having the courage to come out and say it, trying to put the smears up. We had Bob McMullan saying in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> today that it is improper for husbands to divest to their wives, and the guidelines say they should not do it. There was no question of divestment here. I never had property in those shares. I never divested them. I could not divest my wife of property she had legitimately owned. You have slid around and tried to put the smear and the slur out there without coming out and making your accusations clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also make it entirely clear: no decision I have taken could have influenced my wife's shareholding&mdash;nor would I take any. The proposition that I would sit down and say, `Oh, 200 hundred shares for my wife, what can I do in relation to them?' is feeble. In fact, as the Prime Minister has said, I was the one who went into the cabinet and said to the cabinet that family members should stay out of a float. My wife stayed out of it and, as far as I know, all of the cabinet members did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you who did have CBA shares, which he did not reveal at the weekend. Your children held CBA shares. Whilst you were out against my wife on the weekend, your children had CBA shares. You sat in a cabinet which decided to float those shares and it was under the Labor Party float that my wife bought them. Why didn't you come out to the press on the weekend and say, `I'd like to disclose my children have shares in the CBA and attack Mr Costello's wife for the same thing'? You sat in the cabinet whilst those shares were floated and your children partook. My wife partook too, under a Labor Party privatisation. I declared it in 1994 and it has sat on the public record ever since. It was disclosed again to this parliament. It was 200 shares. If you think my wife does not have the right to buy and make investments out of her own earnings, you are entirely wrong.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Today is Australia Breast Cancer Day and in this context it is worth while looking at some pretty sobering statistics. Seven thousand Australian women will get breast cancer this year. About 2,500 can be expected to die from it this year. Seventy per cent of breast cancer will be in women over 50 years of age and one in 14, or seven per cent of women, can expect to get breast cancer by the time they turn 75 years of age.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some good news though and that is that we are making some inroads into these statistics by early detection and treatment, by medical research and, more importantly, just by simple community awareness of what it is and what the risk factors are. That is the point of today&mdash;trying to maintain this progress. That will be the message that we are trying to get out across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia Breast Cancer Day is an annual event designed to raise awareness about breast cancer and provide the community with some up-to-date information. It acts as a call to action for women between 35 and 70 years of age. It is largely organised by the Australian Cancer Society, Breastscreen Australia and the National Breast Cancer Centre. It has the government's full support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The theme for this year is to take care and take action. The key messages of the day will be: any breast problems, see your doctor; if you are over 50, have a mammogram every two years; if you are over 35 and have a family history of breast cancer, undertake breast self&hyphen;examination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today is not principally a fundraising day, but this year the Australian Cancer Society has decided to distribute pink ribbons for sale with ABCD printed on them. I am wearing one and a number of honourable members on both sides of the House are doing so. The funds raised from this will go to the Kathleen <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5301"> Cunningham Breast Cancer Research Foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This foundation was established in 1994. This year we provided it with $1 million in the budget and matching funding of $1 million on a dollar&hyphen;for&hyphen;dollar basis with private donations. It is managed by the Australian Cancer Society and it is charged with supporting and promoting research of relevance to breast cancer and raising funds to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member asked about breast cancer screening. In the five years to 30 June this year, 1.67 million instances of mammographic screening have been undertaken&mdash;about a third of them in the last 12 months, which shows the increasing popularity and effectiveness of the program. About 57 per 10,000 women screened are shown to have breast cancer; that is about one in 175. On rescreening it is 38 per 10,000 women, which is about one in 260.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such results show the importance of a strong national response to breast cancer. Early detection and awareness of the risk factors are the only chance we have to reduce this menace. It will be of particular benefit to women themselves and to the broader Australian society that shares with them the personal and social costs of breast cancer.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition could be a little more explicit about his allegations of conflicts of interest, as I must say I am at a little bit of a loss to understand quite what conflict of interest he is alleging.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have gone through a little list of some of the people who sat on like committees for the Labor Party when it was in government. I find people like Ralph Willis. He is a public servant, is he? I find Robert Ray, Nick Bolkus, David Beddall, Alan Griffiths and Peter Staples. I find the Hon. Bob McMullan was chairman.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Is the minister aware of recent media reports indicating that 25 per cent of businesses currently engaged in exports are looking towards the Middle East as a target for new export business in the year ahead? Does this confirm the government's policy approach of increasing efforts to gain better market access in the Middle East?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Wide Bay for his question and point out that I welcome the DHL-Gallup poll of Australian exporters, as it does show what I believe is a healthy trend&mdash;that businesses are looking to market diversification and that the Middle East markets are the target of some of that diversification activity in the years ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the federal government's policy is to put Asia first in the trade equation, but that is not Asia first and last; it is Asia and the rest of the world. For too long the markets of the Middle East have been constrained by ignorance about the region, by outdated and inaccurate stereotypes and by a belief that the region was too distant and too difficult to penetrate as a viable market for Australian exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is gradually changing. We have started to work towards removing these misconceptions and to broaden the base of our trade into services as well as commodities, focussing on new opportunities in the education sector, demonstrating our capabilities in new fields such as environmental management, and seeking major contracts such as Transfield with the Kuwaiti armed forces. I know a number of members have been to Kuwait, most notably last year, in circumstances to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5303"> further facilitate Australia's linkage with Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these gains, the government is working to provide support and assistance aimed at facilitating broader market access for Australian markets. Indeed, later this week, on Thursday, there will be talks with the Saudi Arabian government and the Minister for Commerce from Saudi Arabia here in Canberra as part of a joint ministerial commission round of activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also welcome the formal negotiation of a trade agreement with Lebanon that will provide Australian businesses with an opportunity to participate in the reconstruction of that country. Assistance through the further development of scientific and technological exchanges with Israel is also welcome, along with the other activities which the Australian government is mounting through Austrade, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and through a raft of other activities. In short, I welcome the interest of business in expanding further west from South-East Asia, not just to the Middle East but also to south Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, and I and others will be visiting India, a member of the SAARC group of nations, as part of the launch of the Australia&hyphen;India: New Horizons promotion to make more effort and access with regard to the growing market potential of India, especially given the increasing purchasing power of its middle class.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has got a very good local government. The publication which I launched in Darwin provided some 21 examples of how to balance the demands of a growing tourism industry with the conservation needs of Australia's natural areas. The projects covered included the Cape York broadwalk interpretation area, the desert parks pass visitor package for the far north of South Australia, the energy innovations of the Broome bird observatory, and the environmental impact assessment of Antarctic tourism, just to mention some of the 21 projects. The projects span a range of management challenges that include research information, technology, innovation, protection, tracks, training, transport and waste in a range of ecosystems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Visitor management in natural areas is a delicate balancing act that requires knowledge, sensitivity and cooperation between the land managers and the tourist industry. Australia's natural areas are drawing increasing numbers of visitors, both domestic and international. For example, some 50 per cent of the 3.1 million inbound visitors in 1994 reported having visited our natural areas. Given the significance of the economic benefits of tourism, this rate is good news for Australia. It is good news because this sort of tourism is high dispersal tourism: the economic benefits are spread throughout the region and rural Australia and are not kept within the metropolitan area alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tourist industry currently accounts for some 6.6 per cent of GDP, some $13 billion annually in exports, and handles some 536,000 jobs. Tourism's inclusion in the industry portfolio by this government is a recognition of its major contribution to the economy and its continued growth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  of Friday, 11 October 1996 in an article by Roy Masters headed `Quayle launches attack on "political interference"', the Australian Rugby League chief executive, John Quayle, accused a number of politicians, including me, of attempting to influence ARL clubs to join the News Ltd Super League. Mr Quayle is quoted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Steve Martin . . . has resigned from the board of Illawarra because he opposes the club remaining with the ARL.</PARA>
<PARA>Further in the article, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The politicians have been silent for so long . . . What right have they got now to ring our clubs and demand they switch to News Ltd?</PARA>
<PARA>Both of these claims are absolutely untrue. As a director of the board of the Steelers, I had only ever sought information relevant to my fiduciary duties and in the best interest of the club which would allow me to make an informed decision. At no stage have I ever said the Steelers should become a Super League team. My resignation was prompted by clear conflicts of interest between my roles as a board member and the shadow minister for sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the second misrepresentation, I remind Mr Quayle of my efforts last year when as Speaker and chairman of the all-party parliamentary rugby league supporters group I tried to facilitate a compromise between the two warring factions. In fact, I have been intimately involved as an ARL club director since the Super League proposal first emerged and have certainly not been silent on the future of rugby league.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I note in the list of politicians slagged by Mr Quayle former Senator Richardson's name does not appear. Could it be because he was a major player for the ARL? Regrettably, comments such as those of Mr Quayle perpetuate the disinformation spread by both sides.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, there is an important issue before the House today with respect to this private member's motion relating to the ability of pensioners and other concession cardholders to get uniform concessions when travelling interstate as well as intrastate. I have discussed these issues with a number of organisations such as the National Seniors Association, which supports the view put in the motion and is working on a suggested formula which may enable state governments, in cooperation with the Commonwealth, to ensure that this can be brought about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5316"> I have discussed these issues with the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, which has indicated that it receives many complaints from pensioners facing difficulties with the issue of concessions on public transport and particularly with respect to the non&hyphen;uniformity of those concessions when travelling interstate. I have received indications of support from the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Associa tion of New South Wales and also from the equivalent organisation in Victoria with whom I had discussions on the issue last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to see that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is in the House at the moment. I would urge him to take note of the debate today and to examine the question of transport concessions for pensioners and raise all endeavours that he can, in concert with the states, through the Australian Transport Council, to examine ways and means that all governments can work together to build a uniform concession structure in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Transport is increasingly important for older Australians and public transport fares&mdash;rail especially&mdash;are not cheap, even when travelling intrastate. This is important, given that we are much more mobile, that families are much more mobile. Children tend to move interstate quite readily once they have grown up and acquire careers and therefore their parents often find it difficult to stay in touch with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By introducing uniformity of concession treatment, this will enable many, many older Australians greater access to their children who have moved interstate and will ensure that the potential for confusion and embarrassment that I referred to in the earlier part of my contribution is dramatically reduced. It will reflect the new reality of existence in Australia, which is that people live lives which cross state boundaries, that families are now across state boundaries and that people throughout the country have connections, contacts and relationships with people in other parts of the country much more broadly than they once did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the government and the minister, in cooperation with the states&mdash;and, as I have said before, this is said with no sense of criticism of the current federal minister or government or previous federal governments, or current or previous state governments&mdash;to take a serious look at this issue and see what can be done to build a structure which enables Australian governments to provide uniform transport concessions to pensioners across the country and eliminates the prospect for embarrassment and difficulty which exists <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> today and which is being experienced on a widespread basis across the nation at this present time.</PARA>

I certainly agree that the consistency of transport concessions right across the nation is something which we ought to look at, something which we ought to consider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is interesting to note that the former government was in office for some 13 years, and yet we saw no positive action to bring into law the aims sought by the motion moved by the honourable member for Melbourne. In fact, prior to the election, the coalition incorporated into its policy a desire to work for uniformity of concession arrangements throughout the country. I must say that the honourable member for Melbourne is a little behind the times as he appears not to be aware that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) has referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, which I chair, the question of concession cards.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">of greater consistency in the concessions available to concession card holders in different regions and suggestions on standard core concessions.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5317"> </PARA>
<PARA>This government, unlike its predecessor, has already acted to refer to a parliamentary committee this whole issue of concession card availability and eligibility. The committee&mdash;an all&hyphen;party committee, of course&mdash;is working diligently through the 42 submissions it has received. Public hearings will take place throughout the nation, with a view to achieving an appropriate response to the matter referred to us by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that the honourable member for Melbourne in his motion has only approached a narrow part of the overall subject. He has referred to transport concessions. The matters that he has outlined are, indeed, relevant, and it is appropriate for this parliament to achieve an appropriate solution. I certainly do not want to pre-empt any decision of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, nor would I do so, but the matters which have been raised by him have been raised in a number of submissions received by members of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Melbourne also pointed out that the major givers of concessions in this area are state and territory governments. I imagine he is seeking that the Commonwealth has a facilitating role in encouraging discussions between, on the one hand, state and territory governments and, on the other, the Commonwealth parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought be noted that the history of concession cards is relevant. But some honourable members might not be aware that the Commonwealth government, through the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs, issues a range of cards to low income Australians. The Department of Social Security issues the pensioner concession card, the health benefits card, the health care card and the Commonwealth seniors health card. The Department of Veterans' Affairs issues its own pensioner concession card and the repatriation health card.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the core benefits&mdash;namely, access at a concessional rate to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme&mdash;is a common benefit to holders of all cards. There are some variations, depending on the particular card held. But access at a concessional rate to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth pharmaceutical benefits scheme is the core benefit relating to these cards. Various state and territory governments have used the issue of cards by the Commonwealth as a means of determining eligibility for a broad range of other benefits, including benefits the subject of this particular motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite a few people are concerned over the way that we do have differing benefits in different parts of the country. As the honourable member for Melbourne has pointed out, we do now have a mobile population. But one of the difficulties we have is that, even if we had an arrangement of uniform reciprocal rights, this would not necessarily ensure uniformity of benefits right throughout the country. The reason for that is that, in different parts of the country, different states and territories have decided that different benefits will be available to those senior citizens to whom this country owes so much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we would have to do, firstly, would be to achieve an agreement nationally on what concessions should be available throughout the various states and territories. Then, of course, once that agreement has been achieved nationally, the next step would be to have the state and territory governments, along with the Commonwealth, agree that those concessions ought to apply right across the nation. There are enormous differences in the various concessions available, the various benefits available, the various subsidies available. One simply cannot treat this as a simple problem, a problem to be swept away with a signature on a document. Much consultation will be needed on a national basis, with a view to achieving a very reasonable outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the honourable member for Melbourne highlighted that, in his view, we really ought to become a unitary state and not a federation. He did not actually use those words, but he said that a lot of the differences we find in regional parts of Australia are such that, indeed, we really need a national approach rather than the current approach we now have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">States and territories are also aware of the need to increase uniformity of concessions available to Australians who live in various <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5318"> parts of the country. Indeed, there have been discussions at Commonwealth level between, on the one hand, the Commonwealth and, on the other, the territories and states with a view to achieving the sorts of outcomes that the honourable member for Melbourne seeks to achieve, not only in the area of transport but also in many other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a country with a very large land area, a very dispersed population and a wide range of differing climatic conditions, it is easy to see that a certain concession in one part of the country might not necessarily be appropriate somewhere else. These are problems to be worked through with a view to achieving solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, the Queensland government has pointed out that there is already a collaborative relationship between the Commonwealth and the state/territory levels of government and that this needs to be encouraged to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of concession program delivery by all levels of government. The Queensland minister also points out in that government submission that, apart from the role provided by COAG, the agencies which would seem most appropriate for ensuring a coordinated approach in the area of concessions are those of the Health and Community Services Ministerial Council, the standing committee on community services and income security administrators, and the latter's income security subcommittee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister from Queensland, Mr Lingard, suggests that it would be useful that any recommendations arising out of a report of the House of Representatives standing committee should indeed be referred to the Health and Community Services Ministerial Council and the standing committee of administrators for consideration. I would certainly hope that as a matter of course this method would indeed be followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Other governments have also indicated in principle that they are supportive of the need for greater uniformity of concessions throughout the country, but as I read through the submissions it is obvious that there are prob lems which will have to be discussed. Different states have differing problems, but it is important to work it through. I believe that, in due course, the report handed down by our committee will certainly give some food for thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise that we are a federation. It is important to recognise that the federal government is simply not able to impose uniformity in this area. We can certainly take a leadership role in our meetings with ministers from throughout the country. There are a whole range of issues that the committee will obviously be looking at. There is the possibility of a reduction in the number of concession cards available. One would have to look at the flow-on effect on state/territory concessions. There has even been a suggestion that concession cards could be cashed out and that people should be paid an amount which would compensate them for the loss of their concession card. This is a laudable aim, but a lot of discussion will be necessary. It is, however, really great to see the honourable member for Melbourne at last supporting coalition policy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleague the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) in his plea for uniform reciprocal rights for concession card holders, particularly but not only for public transport. I would also like to add to the points made by the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) in drawing to the attention of the House some of the more general concerns about recent restrictions by the Commonwealth and state governments, especially the Victorian government, on the eligibility and value of some pensioner concession cards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the benefit of the member for Fisher, the member for Melbourne is certainly very well aware of the inquiry being undertaken by the parliamentary committee, of which I am pleased to be a member. The member for Melbourne is a very strong supporter of access to public transport for pensioners, as am I. It is very important that this specific issue has been brought to the attention of the House today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concessions available on all of the different cards are provided by the Commonwealth, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5319"> state and local governments although, as the member for Melbourne said, these services do apply in very different ways in different jurisdictions. That is the case for public transport as well as for a range of other areas of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any restriction on the eligibility of these cards will obviously affect the recipients' access to a wide range of services. I am particularly concerned about a recommendation in the National Commission of Audit report, which this government commissioned. The recommendation under the heading `Pensioner concessions' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responsibility for the provision of service specific subsidies should lie with the states.</PARA>
<PARA>I for one do not agree with that. I think it is extremely important that the Australian government take responsibility in this area. I do not agree that these are issues only for the states. That is why we have the sorts of problems which the member for Melbourne has drawn our attention to. Bigger problems arise in this area from the decisions of this Commonwealth government. Card holders are going to be seriously affected by reductions in concessions announced in this federal budget. I will mention a few of them here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Fisher might take a bit of notice of the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program. Pensioner concession card holders are going to be effectively denied free dental care, a very serious change. The second area that is going to affect older people is the increase in the cost of prescriptions, something which he mentioned in his speech. But of course he did not draw attention to the increase in cost. Another matter of serious concern to pensioner concession card holders is the tightening of eligibility for access to hearing services. All of these issues are very serious matters and arise out of this government's attitude to concession card holders, which is to limit their access to concessions overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see a similar approach being taken by some state governments. I particularly draw attention to the state of Victoria, which is becoming famous for reducing the scope and size of benefits available to concession card <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> holders. These are for basic services&mdash;water, electricity and gas. The Victorian Council of Social Services estimates that, to make up for the reduction in pensioner concessions, charities in Victoria in 1994 spent $7 million on the utility bills of poor householders. The reason they had to do that was that governments like the one opposite and the one we have in Victoria, reduced the amount being spent on pensioner concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These restrictions on eligibility and service provision for card holders come at a particularly difficult time when governments, like this federal government and the state government that we have in Victoria, are reducing community based services that pensioners have traditionally turned to for support. What we also see in Victoria is a reduction in pensioner concessions being offered by local government. That, too, is putting considerable hardship on all those who have previously sought benefit from pensioner concessions. This is a very serious matter&mdash;one that I am very pleased to rise and support. But what we most of all need to see is a continuing commitment from this government to deliver pensioner concessions where they are needed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I came into this House full of enthusiasm to support the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) in his approach to get some uniformity on behalf of older people who have a problem with travel concessions when they go interstate. The member for Melbourne would be well aware that the area I represent, McMillan, has been restructured heavily in regard to industry&mdash;downsizing and changes that have happened across Australia but specifically in McMillan. During the recession we had to have, when one person lost their job across Australia five people lost their jobs in the Latrobe valley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am disappointed because, rather than taking a bipartisan approach, as required by the honourable member for Melbourne in regard to this very important issue, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) came in and took a partisan approach to the whole debate. In other words, she actually disregarded the emphasis that was put on this motion by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5320"> member for Melbourne&mdash;that is, direct care for those people who find themselves confused or put out by the changes in travel concessions across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the restructuring in the area of McMillan, many families have moved out of the area and in some cases interstate. They are the older people who are having trouble with these sorts of changes as they move from state to state to visit their children who have moved from Victoria to Queensland, to New South Wales, to South Australia and to Western Australia. But, no, we get from the member for Jagajaga a straight&hyphen;out attack on what has happened in Victoria in regard to the changes they have made there. Why? Because they have nothing else to say for themselves, not one positive line to put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time I have come in in a bipartisan situation to say that we have a problem in Australia that is affecting older people&mdash;the older people in your seat, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, the older people who live in the seat of Melbourne and the older people who live in the seat of Fisher, and I know that area of Caloundra fairly well. There are a number of people who retire to that area and they get confused when they come to Victoria and their cards do not allow them to do the same things they do in their home state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wouldn't you think governments in this country could by now have got their act together enough to say to our older people, `Look, one thing we can do for you is get you a uniform concession card that goes right across Australia'? Wouldn't you think we could at least do that? All of a sudden we are told, `No. You are the federal government. It doesn't affect you.' Well, it does affect the federal government. Somebody has to pay in the end. That is what happens. That is why we have to take an interest in what happens. The federal government does commit to state governments to pay towards some of the concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am one who thinks there should be some clear lines on all issues that this is what the states will look after and this is what the federal government will look after. Then we would all know what we are on about and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where we are headed and we can get on with it. In this particular case, after 13 years&mdash;and I was not going to raise this&mdash;not a lot has been achieved in this area, and the member for Melbourne knows that. He is showing his disappointment. The member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) is disappointed, I am disappointed and, Mr Deputy Speaker, I can see by your face that you are pretty disappointed too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the National Commission of Audit was concerned as to whether the responsibility should be at a federal or state level I think it was talking about the whole range of concessions, not specifically transport. I came in here today to talk about transport. To judge the nation's governance, be it by the opposition previously or by this Howard government, is to say, `There are things we can do. Let's quickly get on with the job.' We should be judged by how we treat our very, very young, people with disabilities, those who are underprivileged and those who are older.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every one of us when we get to our age has older parents, and we know the confusion that comes in their banking, their concessions&mdash;the sorts of things they expect from their over-60s card. I have never seen my father&hyphen;in&hyphen;law so excited as he was on the day he got his over&hyphen;60s card and he could go on the train at a concession rate. He was very excited. There are things we can do for not only our veterans but those who are older. I take a bipartisan approach here and support the member for Melbourne because it is something that, given a bit of drive, a bit of leadership, we can achieve together.</PARA>

<PARA>Honourable members have recently participated in the 1996 Australian census of population and housing. Some honourable members may have even been lucky enough to record that they were at home with their families on census night. Despite having participated in the census, many Australians remain unaware that the census forms are destroyed after the Australian Bureau of Statistics has extracted the data required&mdash;a process that may take up to two years. People often assume, quite wrongly, that these costly and valuable records would be stored in a secure place for future reference and verification purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The census is undoubtedly valuable. It is the only record that gives us a complete snapshot in time of the Australian people. It is an invaluable and unique record that could be used in the future for environmental medical research, genetic research, demographic research and historic research, including family history research which is enthusiastically pursued by tens of thousands of proud Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this record is destroyed under current policy. Officers of the ABS argue that by promising to destroy the original forms, with names listed under each household, the information provided by those completing the forms will be more reliable. The ABS is fairly unique in this view. In <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> countries like the US, the UK and Canada, census forms are preserved with long-term embargos on their public release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABS claim that census retention would cause significant underenumeration due to the alleged privacy and confidentiality concerns of the public. This simply means that people would not cooperate with the census and the population count or enumeration would be inaccurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We might well then ask: are the US, UK and Canadian censuses inaccurate? I doubt it. The ABS allege that Australians are more concerned with privacy issues than other, in their view, not comparable nationals. Again, I very much doubt this. However, the issue is really whether legitimate concerns about privacy are compatible with retention of the census. I submit that they are. We can have our cake and eat it too. In the UK, the Registrar&hyphen;General, up&hyphen;front on the census form, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your answers will be treated in strict confidence and used only to produce statistics. Names and addresses will not be put into the computer. Only the postcode will be entered. The forms will be kept securely within my office and treated as confidential for 100 years.</PARA>
<PARA>The British people seem quite happy with this, and I do not believe that Australians exhibit a greater degree of paranoia than UK citizens. Indeed, if an Australian or English citizen really had something to hide, like an illegal alien in the spare bedroom, I doubt under either guarantee that this household resident would be noted on the census forms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some fact sheets issued by the principals of the `Save the Census for History's Sake Campaign'&mdash;Michele Stephens of Family Tree Connections and Nick Vine Hall of the Census Working Party of the Australian Federation of Family History Organisations&mdash;it is alleged that the ABS has never presented any public evidence to support the claim that retention would cause significant underenumeration. I am calling for an independent public inquiry to be conducted into this issue with a view to preserving the census data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last census cost $140 million to conduct. For $2 million more, we could have preserved this priceless record on microfiche <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5322"> for posterity and practical research. Noted geneticist Dr Max Nicholls, of the University of New South Wales, has recently said that the census could provide an invaluable tool for future researches into rare diseases and in forensic science, and it is an act of stupidity to destroy it. My colleague the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) is to elucidate on the medical research use of census data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members of the Advisory Council on Australian Archives have expressed concern about this issue. In June 1995 their annual report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members remain concerned with current Government policy that all census returns be destroyed after relevant information has been extracted. Members consider that a major reference source is being lost to the nation.</PARA>
<PARA>My colleagues the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) will elaborate on this and cite other reasons for, and will support, retention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that nearly 60 members of the federal parliament have placed on the record their support for retention, and many others have yet to examine the issue. It seems that support is growing. I do recognise the work of the Australian Democrats in the Senate in support of retaining the census. What does concern me, however, is the propensity for this issue to go on to the backburner after each census. I, for one, am determined to keep the issue alive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Law Reform Commission, under the Hon. Mr Justice Michael Kirby, as he then was, looked at this issue and gave a provisional view in a report published in 1979. It said that identified census information should be retained subject to an embargo of 75 years. Significantly, the commission also recommended that the Director-General of Archives should be given discretion to allow access to approved medical research within the 75-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appalling that the issues raised in that report have not been pursued with the seriousness that they deserve at a governmental and parliamentary level. I note that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> has supported the issue <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> strongly at an editorial level. With support of this calibre, I am hopeful that finally commonsense will prevail and we will put a stop to the senseless destruction of our Australian census. It should be noted that in 1991 a document was published by UNESCO on the archival appraisal of records containing personal information. The author of that document, Terry Cook, stated that there are four essential personal information record types that must be retained permanently: records proving civil status, land registration records, certain court and legal records and the national census of the population. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) had given me the courtesy of supporting my moves in relation to the census. It is just unfortunate that he is not able to be here today to support this motion. He would have been able to give some further information about UNESCO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By destroying these records, we are destroying a unique part of our cultural heritage. I would go so far as to say that it is a barbaric act of historical vandalism, and it should stop. It is within the power of members of this parliament to ensure that this practice is discontinued, that we do have our cake and eat it too and that we retain this vital information and preserve the interests and the privacy of Australian citizens.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I wish to congratulate the member for Cook (Mr Mutch) on bringing this motion to the House and, indeed, on speaking so strongly for the motion. Given the normal pressures of parliamentary life, not to mention the individual interests of MPs, I do not expect colleagues on either side to regard this as the most pressing issue of the year. But it is an issue of significant importance, both for now and for future historians, archivists and genealogists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is one of the few countries in the world that pulps its census forms. The date is left but records of the names and addresses are destroyed, along with census forms, about 18 months after collection. It is, indeed, an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5323"> act of great vandalism. Census collections are not cheap. Indeed, this very important information should be preserved for the work of archivists and it is increasingly coming to light, for the medical side, where benefits can be achieved from tracing through the census form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was my privilege to serve on the Advisory Council of the Australian Archives for some 10 years. When I was replaced after the last election I believe I was the longest serving member, having served since the advisory council was set up. Each year the Advisory Council of the Australian Archives would extensively discuss the retention of the census form. It is true that that advisory council made recommendations over a number of years. There were long discussions. With the turnover of the membership, you would see the new members coming in. It was interesting that they were all very firm on the idea that the information on the census should be retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During each debate I would present the usual arguments. They became a little parrot&hyphen;like because I always used to say, `This will never get through the parliament, this will never get through the parliament, the opposition of the day&mdash;be it Liberal or Labor&mdash;will oppose it. They will oppose it along the lines of "Big Brother is interfering" or "Big Brother is watching". What does this intrusive government want this information for?' I have always supported keeping the census form, but I used to put that argument. As if to support what I was saying, I guess it is a lesson for us all that we will not always be in opposition, just as we will not always be in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September 1985 there was a debate on the Census and Statistics Amendment Bill dealing with the census. The then member for Denison, Mr Hodgman, actually made a speech. It is an unbelievable speech. If anyone wants to read it, it is on page 1265 of the 18 September 1985 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He was talking exactly about this. This is the sort of nonsense that people go on about in relation to this. That is why I particularly welcome this motion by the member for Cook, especially section 2(b), which states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">establish a public inquiry within 12 months of the 1996 Census to examine and recommend on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the central purposes and other valuable benefits of the census data, including its use for medical, historic, cultural, demographic and genealogical research; and</PARA>

<PARA>To me this is vital if we are to avoid some of the more extreme reactions in the community, and we get those. Talkback radio experts, the great conspiracy theorists and the conspiracy advocates would have a field day, but by logical debate we might be able to prove the worth of maintaining the information on the records. That is why I think it is important to have an inquiry. People who are somehow frightened that Big Brother government is going to move in and keep all this information or it is going to be a very intrusive move would hopefully have their fears put to rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not quite as sure as the member for Cook that Australians are not more paranoid than the Brits. Having lived through the debate on the identification card and a few other debates in this place, I think they are pretty paranoid, especially if Canberra wants to retain information. They get very worried. I know that successive Treasurers of the day have always come into this place and given the guarantee that the information will be destroyed&mdash;for good reason, I suppose. As has been said, it is an act of vandalism. That information is vital information that should be used not only for medical research but by genealogists. Many people have a great interest in tracing family history and writing local history. Archivists are very interested in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following an appraisal of information proposed to be collected in this latest census, the Archives issued a disposal authority on 21 September 1994 approving the destruction of name identified records created in this past census and subsequent censuses. The appraisal acknowledged the potential research value of the records but endorsed the government's position that this was overridden by the need to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the census. It was felt that this could be achieved <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5324"> only by a public undertaking that name identified information would be destroyed once relevant data had been extracted from it. This name identified data collected in the latest census will not be ready for destruction until 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Director-General of the Australian Archives has the power to revoke disposal authorities so that, in theory, it would still be possible to move to retain the 1996 records. In practice, however, unless there is a significant change in the position of the government and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, it is unlikely that there would be compelling grounds to revoke the authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although it might be too late to save the 1996 census&mdash;I personally do not believe it is too late&mdash;hopefully, this will not be the case in the next census, which I understand is due in 2001. There is clearly significant support among family historians for the retention of name identified census information. Less is known about the general community view, either of positive support for retention or of definite opposition to retention on privacy grounds. I suggest that this dilemma could be resolved by the establishment of the public inquiry as outlined in the motion now being debated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As people have said, other countries do retain this information. In Britain it cannot be accessed for 100 years, and in the United States I think it is 75 years. Some years ago there was some debate in Germany about privacy considerations. From memory, in the Netherlands there was also debate about privacy considerations. I do not think these forms have been retained in the Netherlands. Other countries such as Canada retain these forms. They retain them for a very good reason. I cannot put it better than the honourable member for Cook. He said words to the effect that it was not cheap to conduct a census&mdash;from memory, he said it costs about $142 million&mdash;and that we could keep this valuable information for a few more thousand dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I very much support the retention of census data and I again congratulate the member for Cook for moving this motion. He has my support for whatever moves he makes for this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very valuable information. I hope, now that we are in opposition, that we are not negative on this. I hope for once that an opposition can show a positive attitude and have a bipartisan approach to this matter and retain this very valuable resource information.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too support the motion before the House, moved by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Mutch), and the propositions which make up this motion. I do not wish to repeat the arguments which have been advanced by the honourable member for Cook or the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), but I wish to touch upon one aspect of the honourable member's motion, namely, the support by geneticists for the retention on a permanent basis of census material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I speak, work is being undertaken in scientific laboratories throughout the world that will have an unprecedented impact on medical treatment in the future. That work, known as the human genome project, has the goal of mapping and sequencing the entire genome, which will lead to further knowledge about the structure and the function of human genes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a project which was funded in 1989 by the United States Congress and is scheduled to last for some 15 years. What is occurring in that project is that scientists have begun to map the genes, the 100,000 or so fragments of DNA strung like little beads up and down the chromosomes that tell our cells what to do and how to behave&mdash;chemical messengers that race from cell to cell. Genes can become broken, mutated or simply relay faulty information for reasons unknown. That results in a variety of disorders&mdash;such as cancer, some types of diabetes, cystic fibrosis, haemophilia and muscular dystrophy. These genes not only can be measured, dyed, isolated and identified but also can be diced, spliced, split apart, mutated and generally changed through the work which is being undertaken in the laboratory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this project is that it will greatly increase the capacity to detect genes leading to disease susceptibility. It will also greatly increase the availability of genetic testing, identifying the genetic bases of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5325"> diseases&mdash;even some newly discovered to be genetic&mdash;and increasing the number of tests for detecting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of issues raised by this technology&mdash;for example, whether information is being destroyed that may in future be invaluable to understanding the pattern of genetic defects in families and in the communities and whether that information may be useful in treatment&mdash;and this touches upon the motion before the House at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How the information is to be used is, of course, another issue involving not only medical and scientific matters but also social, cultural, legal and ethical considerations. I mention in passing, for example, the parameters of genetic testing. There are already many tests available so far as genetic diseases are concerned. For example, there is genetic testing for Huntington's disease, for multiple endocrine neoplasia, for myotonic dystrophy, for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, for Alzheimer's disease and also for some forms of colon cancer; and many more tests are being discovered at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that we have these tests available, there are questions about what constraints are in place&mdash;for example, whether employers or insurers can make use of this information and whether they can require employees or the insured to undergo these sorts of tests. I note that a number of United States states have passed laws about a matter which, to date, has been little discussed here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But genetic testing and counselling is just one aspect. These are two aspects of the information which is collected in the census which are very important. Firstly, there are diseases the onset of the symptoms of which are masked, thereby delaying effective treatment. For instance, in Huntington's chorea, there can be the onset of this disease some 10 years before the symptoms become obvious and, therefore, a course of treatment could have been undertaken if the sort of information that the honourable member is relating in his motion was available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there is environmental disease. For example, we have had talk about particular environmental cancers at Port Kembla and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we have a history of environmental cancer caused at Wittenoom. In the Wittenoom case, we are talking about a period of some 20 to 30 years of causation between exposure to the asbestosis fibres and the onset of asbestosis. If it were possible to actually identify people that have been subject to that, then it is possible that some more effective treatments could be placed in store than is the case at present. When the honourable member's motion talks about support from geneticists for the retention of the census data, that is something which I support as being very important.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wholeheartedly support the motion from the honourable member for Cook (Mr Mutch). I am delighted that he has moved it and I congratulate him for moving it. This subject is one of a number that I have campaigned on ever since I was elected to parliament about 12 years ago. When I raised it about 10 years ago, one or two speakers on the other side expressed great alarm at the consequences of keeping census information. They said that it would be an invasion of privacy, that you could not trust officials to keep it confidential and so on which, of course, I do not believe is true at all. It is a fine thing that the honourable member for Cook is doing in again presenting the case for this and, as has been shown, there is now, amongst those who have spoken at least, a consensus that this is the right way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the case has been well made but, just to repeat the very obvious parts of it, it is very important to retain information which has been rigorously collected because it can be of great use in all sorts of ways. Many of my friends are historians and they would love access to information of this kind, even if it were only available 50 or 75 years down the road. One census that was kept from the 19th century is immeasurably valuable to them. At a time when one wants to improve not only the quality of genetic research&mdash;as the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) has eloquently argued&mdash;but also social, scientific and historical research, to have this information potentially available would really be very valuable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5326">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once it has been collected, it is also a great waste to destroy it. The census costs a great deal of money and involves a great deal of work. To destroy that information seems to be squandering the results of a very valuable government activity on behalf of the community. That kind of vandalism should not be encouraged or allowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the previous Statistician&mdash;a man I admire for his technical capacity&mdash;was opposed to keeping the information on the grounds that it would discourage those who are concerned about invasion of privacy from being willing to accurately and fully comply with the requirements of the census collectors, but I think he is probably exaggerating the value to the census collectors of destroying the information. Most people will not know whether it is kept or destroyed; most people will assume that it is going to be retained. And it would allay the fears of only a very few people if there were a commitment to destroy it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is important are the conditions under which it is kept. They can be rigorously and very firmly set and maintained and people can be assured about that by adequate publicity about what is to happen. So I do not think that the previous Statistician's concerns were as well founded as they might have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to urge the honourable member for Cook to pursue this further. It is one thing to move a motion in the House&mdash;we will not be voting on it&mdash;and it is a very valuable thing to have agreement, but you need to take the issue further. I hope that you will take it up with the Treasurer (Mr Costello), the minister responsible, and report to him that there has been agreement about this, that there is strong support for it on both sides and that you have advocated an effective way forward which includes not only a decision in principle about retaining the forms but also establishing an inquiry about exactly what would happen to them. That seems to me a very well judged approach to changing the act and the policy. I hope you will continue with that. I would be very willing to support you in any way you would like. So good on you!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve today for the prospects of our unemployed, faced with the twin evils of an increase in the unemployment rate in the coming months and years as well as dramatic cutbacks by the coalition government to much needed and highly successful labour market programs such as skillshare and jobsclubs. We were provided with ample evidence of that last week from a number of sources which leave little doubt that the unemployment rate will blow out further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">DEETYA's leading indicator of employment for August, released last week, shows that for the fifth month in a row&mdash;in other words, for every month of the coalition government&mdash;there has been a decline in future employment trends. We also see that Saul Eslake, the ANZ's Chief Economist, warned earlier in the week that unemployment is likely to rise above nine per cent in the next six months on the back of the ANZ jobs survey, which has dropped to its lowest level for three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had that bastion of economic rationalism, that Liberal Party think tank, Access Economics, forecasting a rise in the unemployment level well beyond nine per cent: it will average 9.2 per cent in the years 2000 to 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When questioned on the issue of unemployment, the favourite response of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is to say that everything will be fine once the budget is passed and the reforms in the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 are in place. Surely he will have to forgo mounting that defence, given that the Access Economics forecast is based on the budget being passed and on the implementation of the government's labour market so&hyphen;called <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5327"> reforms. There can be no argument that the unemployment rate is going to increase in the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government's first budget has heralded massive cutbacks in the area of labour market programs and, in the limited time I have available today, I would like to point out the disastrous impacts of these cutbacks on my electorate of Isaacs. When I returned to my electorate on the Friday of budget week, the first function I attended was a celebration of work completed on local schools through the federal government's new work opportunities program. I think `commemoration' would have been a better word than `celebration' to describe the event because this function took place only days after the federal budget spelt the end of the very program that was being celebrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Mr David Turnbull, the project coordinator, participants in this particular project were unemployed adults who were willing to take the first step on the road to employment, and the skill and pride that they took in their work is reflected in the high standard of results achieved. So, in spite of the newstart opportunities program being highly successful, the government has determined that it should be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labour market programs in Frankston service areas like Carrum Downs in Isaacs. Carrum Downs has been hit incredibly hard by this government's policy. The peninsula's successful and much praised job creation campaign, jobsnet&mdash;a joint effort between local businesses, media and DEETYA&mdash;has been cut adrift by the federal government, despite being recognised as being a very worthy achievement by the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson). It also received glowing praise from the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, when she visited the area earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a budget of some $72,000 last financial year, jobsnet created 1,076 extra jobs in that 12 months, with over 280 young people now in permanent work as a result of this program. The Westernport Area Consultative Committee had generously donated $15,000 to the program to see it through until the end of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> year. But, of course, its long-term prospects are now well and truly in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding to skillshare programs in Frankston has been cut in half, resulting in the likelihood of staff having to be sacked and trainee placements falling from around 1,000 per year to 400 per year over the next nine months. Given that Frankston CES has four times the number of new registrations each week when compared with CESs in surrounding areas and the fact that unemployment on the Mornington Peninsula rose by 1.6 per cent in the year to August 1996, such harsh cuts to Frankston skillshare will be incredibly damaging to the morale and the prospects of the local unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the skillshare providers in Frankston, Melbourne City Mission, is pulling out all together due to the 50 per cent funding cutbacks by the federal government which will make their local operation financially untenable. In 10 years almost $1 million was invested in the Frankston community and more than 10,000 people were put through formal training. The centre's manager, Ms Pritchard, summed up the situation rather succinctly when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand the need for economic rationalisation, but where is the economic logic in crippling a high-achieving and cost-effective community resource?</PARA>
<PARA>A pertinent question and one which the government to date has simply failed to answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government's priorities in terms of dealing with the unemployed can be seen through the introduction of its so-called `dob in a dole bludger' campaign. The federal government's `dob in a dole bludger' line has been an abject failure. The trial run of this new program over four months in Tasmania has found that, out of over 3,000 calls made, only 30 were complaints&mdash;not necessarily genuine ones. Many of the calls were inquiries about labour market schemes and job subsidies&mdash;the programs the government has slashed in the budget. The government's budget prediction of saving over $100 million over the next year by cracking down on dole cheats is looking very dubious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently over 3,000 people in the Cranbourne area are unable to find work. They <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5328"> desperately want work. These people need the government to provide economic prosperity and effective labour market training&mdash;not spurious attacks on alleged dole bludgers. It is about time the government stopped looking around for phantom savings and got on with the task of improving the unemployment numbers. How can this government say that it is serious about unemployment when it has cut funding for job training and skillshare centres by 35 per cent to 40 per cent this year while at the same time accepting in its budget statement that unemployment numbers will not improve this year under its policy regime?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Cranbourne skillshare centre has had its budget cut by 38 per cent this year and commencements for training courses will drop from 326 to 200 persons. We also had a report in the Cranbourne independent newspaper last week highlighting the loss of around 200 places in job training courses, such as traineeships and apprenticeships at the Casey College of TAFE, which has a campus in Cranbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unemployed in the Chelsea region, numbering approximately 11,700, will also be particularly hard hit by the government's savage cuts to skills training programs conducted by Chelsea skillshare. Located in the heart of Isaacs, Chelsea skillshare receives federal government funding over nine-month periods. In the most recent nine-month period, this fine facility received $219,000 to pursue its range of comprehensive skills training programs. Sadly, in the forthcoming nine-month period, following budget cuts, this funding will reduce to $155,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the next nine months, three classes in front office reception, kitchen attendant and medical receptionist&mdash;a total of nine courses fulfilling the training needs of 90 unemployed people over the next nine months&mdash;will be cut back. Chelsea skillshare had also sought funding for 16 participants for its volunteer work referral service. Even though more than 50 would have enrolled in the course, this course has been cancelled because funding has been withdrawn. Similarly, the resume preparation and jobsearch assistance course has been cut to 10 unemployed enrollees for the forthcoming nine months. One hundred <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and seventy-three students completed this course&mdash;in excess of the number registered to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has gone back on its promise not to cut labour market programs which help unemployed people find these real jobs. These commonsense programs, such as new work opportunities, jobskills, skillshare and jobclub, have been real success stories in getting people off the dole and providing them with skills and training, which makes them job ready and attractive to employers. Given the government's own predictions that there will be little or no reduction in the unemployment rate in the foreseeable future, without these effective labour programs the unemployed face a very bleak future indeed.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance addresses the concerns of my constituents and the wider Australian community about Australia today. While I suspect that recent statements about multiculturalism and the civil war will have eroded some of her support, the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has elicited a considerable reaction from the Australian community that we need to understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wake of the member's maiden speech and media appearances, my office has received a number of letters supporting her views. To determine the cause of the acclaim she has enjoyed, over the weekend I talked to constituents who had written to me. From those conversations it emerged that there was an anger about what was perceived to be disproportionately favourable treatment given to Aboriginal people, as well as about more fundamental issues, which I will address later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was told, `Aboriginals get it so easy,' `I am just fed up with the fact that there is one rule for Aboriginals and another for whites,' and `Why should Aboriginals get millions just because they are Aboriginal?' None of those I talked to knew that $1.3 billion allocated to Aboriginal funding covered roads, water, sewerage, housing, health services and education&mdash;all the things non-Aboriginals take for granted and which come through separate <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5329"> portfolio budgets. They were also not aware that the Aboriginal life expectancy is 18 years below that of the rest of the community and that the infant mortality is three times as high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was told `things that happened 200 years ago aren't my fault', as if the only problem Aboriginal people have ever faced is dispossession. Those I talked to had no concept of the indignities and rejection Aboriginal people have endured in Australia this century. They did not realise that it was not just what happened 200 years ago that has resulted in Aboriginal disadvantage and that it has been the result of policies of successive governments which, for a long time, sought to treat Aboriginals as outcasts. Some local authorities, as recently as the 1960s, were still refusing to let Aboriginal children attend local primary schools or use local swimming pools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Few people are aware that, as recently as 30 years ago, Aboriginal mothers had their young children taken away from them. There was no way to find them and no way to find out any information about them. I can say to members of this House that as a mother, if that had happened to me, I would not be here today. Those that I talked to focused on Aboriginal welfare, because that is what they had read about in the press and seen on television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reject Philip Adams's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of Saturday which suggested that in the Australian psyche there is underlying bigotry and racism. My constituents all said that, if an individual Aboriginal person were disadvantaged, he/she should be looked after. The problem was that they had a misconception about the benefits that were available to Aboriginal people and the situation that many of them lived in. I was told that it was unfair that an Aboriginal person earning $50,000 a year could get a cheap home loan just because they are Aboriginal. Few of us would disagree with that, although we may not be concerned at the apparent inconsistency because we know that not many Aboriginal people earn over $50,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who complained about immigration were misinformed about the benefits to migrants. Very few people were aware that the pension was not available to migrants unless they had been in the country for 10 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years and that from now on migrants would not be able to get social security until they had been in the country for two years. It was generally believed that immigration took jobs. None of the people I talked to knew about the studies which show that immigration creates an equal number of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concern was expressed that in certain parts of Melbourne and Sydney there were areas where none of the shops had English signs and the residents all talked in languages my constituents could not understand. They were afraid and thought it was wrong that they should feel so foreign in their own country. They were surprised to learn that, despite their perception, only four per cent of our population was born in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley has put a public voice to private conversations. She has repeated in parliament the types of things that people have been saying in supermarkets, in pubs, and in fish and chip shops. In doing so, she has given urban myths and prejudices a credibility they previously did not have. She has been aided by the media who, desperate for news and controversy, have elevated her to a position of national heroine, even while criticising her views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member herself has succumbed to popular acclaim. Because her maiden speech has put her on the national stage, she believes that she holds some sort of truth that has been suppressed by other parliamentarians. The sad fact is that the member for Oxley did not realise that one of her responsibilities as a parliamentarian was to question and examine stories before she endorsed them. Before she made her maiden speech, she had a responsibility to determine the truth behind what she said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not difficult to win the acclaim of a crowd. Feeding back fears, myths and prejudices can always win a standing ovation but, while it enlarges the ego of the speaker, it does nothing for public information or social cohesion. Consequently, most of us resist this temptation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Undoubtedly, the member for Oxley frequently heard complaints about the unfairness of Aboriginal funding and the fear of migration as she conducted her business. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5330"> member would have served us better had she delved deeper into the concerns of her constituents and found that, while these two areas were given prominence, they were repeated because they were easy targets. The reason they were being voiced so loudly, I believe, stems from a much deeper anxiety the Australian community has about where Australia is today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After my constituents had voiced their concerns about the level of immigration and Aboriginal funding, they spoke about their own lives and the fears they hold for the lives of their children. One of my constituents said that 70 per cent of her friends had been retrenched&mdash;most of them after giving many years of loyal service. `Now,' she said, `they were being discarded without a second thought.' She was watching the loyalty between the employer and the employee that had long been a part of Australian life disappearing, and she and her friends were becoming wary of a new world where the concept of loyalty no longer had any meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Underlying all the complaints was the concern that most people were poorer than they should be and could not afford the sorts of things they should be able to afford. There was a particular concern for the elderly now, but there was a greater concern for what it will be like for the elderly in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young families were concerned that they could no longer keep up payments on health insurance. Older people thought it was unfair that, having paid health insurance all their lives, now, when they needed it most, they could no longer afford it. Parents are watching neighbourhood schools being closed at the same time as jobs for their children are disappearing. When they turn on their television, they see Christopher Skase, who had bankrupted so many people, living a life of luxury in Majorca. They read about salaries of top executives&mdash;some of whom are earning 30 times as much as the average wage earner&mdash;while they have difficulty earning enough to pay for necessities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal funding has been high profile because failures in funding are headlined almost weekly. Immigrants are an easy target because they appear to be different. It is easy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to believe they take jobs because there is a fear at the pace of change&mdash;with the changing face of Australia's migration program being a part of that change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As parliamentarians, we have failed to inform the wider Australian community of the reasons for certain policies and the actual rather than the imagined consequences. We have failed to convince the community that the changes that have happened are positive or will have a positive outcome. We have failed to address the fears and suspicions of the community and, by dismissing their arguments as racist, we have provided a platform for the member for Oxley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The genie is out of the bottle, and I suspect we will not get it back again for some time yet. For years we have suppressed comments on immigration and Aboriginal people&mdash;not with reason and explanation but with accusations of ignorance and racism. Now we have to deal with a widening section of the community whose previously derided views have been given legitimacy by being echoed by a now very high profile member of the federal parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The furore that has erupted after the member for Oxley's maiden speech is not entirely her responsibility. It reflects a disquiet with change, the headlines at all cost policy of the media, the quick pejorative label on those who voiced concern, and the failure of all of us to recognise and address the unease of the Australian community.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising this afternoon to speak in this grievance debate I would firstly like to compliment the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) on her speech. I consider that, in a very factual way, she has rebutted what I regard as very dangerous statements in speeches in recent times by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). The member for Hindmarsh has correctly and in a factual way dealt with the needs of Aboriginals, and she also spoke about the strength of our multicultural society. I also compliment her for having the courage to make the speech that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;the leader of her <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5331"> government&mdash;should have made in this very House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in that context that I speak this afternoon, because I intend to raise the question of leadership. To my way of thinking, the strength of government is clearly reflected in the issue of leadership and the role of the Prime Minister. On this occasion, unlike when he was last in government, the Prime Minister has to face up to the fact that he has control of the levers of government. On this occasion, unlike the course of action he pursued with the loss of government in 1983, responsibility for the performance of the government will rest fairly and squarely on his shoulders and his shoulders alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for these reasons that I want to refer to a few occurrences of last week, because I think they very much go to the question of leadership&mdash;in this instance, the lack of leadership&mdash;by the Prime Minister. I would remind the Prime Minister that the ministerial code of conduct that he now seeks to distance himself from is his ministerial code of conduct, and his ministerial code of conduct alone. It is not the Australian Labor Party's code of conduct; it is the coalition government's ministerial code of conduct. The Prime Minister established those guidelines and he is answerable for those guidelines. So far as I am concerned, his failure to answer in the House this afternoon some pertinent questions as to the application of that ministerial code of conduct reflects badly on his performance as Prime Minister and on the performance of his government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is because of the lack of leadership at the very top of this government so soon after its election in March this year that we now have the coalition itself forming factions. Within seven months of its election on 2 March we have the coalition government, headed by the Prime Minister, John Howard, fairly and squarely divided into two factions&mdash;namely, the Lyons Forum and the John Stuart Mill Forum. The reason the coalition is now divided into factions is the lack of leadership at the very top of the government. The lack of leadership is also reflected in the fact that last week, for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> first time, a coalition member crossed the floor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) cross the floor about? It is an issue of the utmost importance to this parliament and to the nation at large: the question of freedom of speech and the right to debate in this House&mdash;the most important parliamentary forum in the nation&mdash;the issue of euthanasia. Irrespective of one's views on euthanasia, I believe that the member for Dickson was right: the Prime Minister should not have intervened to ensure that the debate was taken out of the House of Representatives&mdash;away from the most important public forum for parliamentary debate in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that very reason, the Prime Minister's standing and integrity have been diminished over recent days. They have been diminished because of his failure to take decisive decisions with respect to the performance of his former Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short. He should have acted last week when first informed that the Assistant Treasurer had failed to abide by the Prime Minister's code of practice with respect to ministerial performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think it is relevant that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) be held accountable with respect to the application of the ministerial code of practice. All I can say to the Treasurer&mdash;now up on his high horse about bringing the accountability of one's family into this House&mdash;is that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show that the Treasurer himself was the first in this parliament to bring the names of family members into the House for debate. He raised the question of a family member of a member of this House when he answered a question at the dispatch box very early on in the life of this parliament. As the first member in the life of this parliament to raise the matter himself, he cannot now say that you cannot refer to a member's family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as I am concerned, it is about leadership. When the Prime Minister last had the opportunity to contribute to the development of the nation&mdash;and when everything went wrong, despite the fact that he had his hands fairly and squarely on the lever of economic performance&mdash;do you know whose fault it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5332"> was? It was not the Prime Minister's fault when he was the Treasurer; it was the fault of Malcolm Fraser&mdash;the then Prime Minister. It was Malcolm Fraser's fault that unemployment went over 10 per cent. It was Malcolm Fraser's fault that inflation went over 10 per cent. It was Malcolm Fraser's fault that schoolchildren were not encouraged and supported in their desire to go on at school. It was Malcolm Fraser's fault that we had a major industrial war in Australia. It was Malcolm Fraser's fault that no child&hyphen;care assistance was offered to most families. It was Malcolm Fraser's fault that there was a low participation rate of women in the Australian work force. The problem for the Prime Minister is that he now has to accept responsibility. There is no&hyphen;one else to blame for his lack of leadership over the last fortnight. That is what it is about&mdash;lack of leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is high time the Prime Minister faced up to the fact that he is now confronting a major problem with respect to the future of Australia&mdash;the all&hyphen;important question of unemployment. I know he was not worried when unemployment was going over 10 per cent when he last had responsibility for this issue. Nor was he worried about the fact that the youth unemployment rate was one of the highest in the history of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that the Prime Minister now has to take this issue seriously, and I will tell you why. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures of last week showed that in just one month over 30,000 full-time jobs were lost in Australia and youth unemployment increased. I consider that, if you care about jobs, if you care about the needs and aspirations of this country, it is about the fundamentals. It is about taking decisive action to assist people. It is about ensuring that there is a decent health care system. It is about ensuring that everyone, irrespective of their level of income or the jobs their parents have, has an equal opportunity for educational advancement. It is about ensuring that we have decent and meaningful job opportunities out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, the problem is the lack of leadership. The fact that the Prime Minister himself is a ditherer is resulting in the nation not facing up to some of the most important <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issues, some of the fundamentals of life. I consider that the Prime Minister ought to be devoting all his energies at the moment to reducing unemployment. It is his budget strategy that has very much contributed to the fact that unemployment since January, when it was at 8.1 per cent, has now grown to 8.7 per cent. It would be over nine per cent today if the participation rate had not fallen by 0.4 per cent last month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nation is calling for leadership. The Prime Minister is a ditherer. He failed to implement his own code of practice&mdash;yes, his code of practice&mdash;with respect to ministerial performance. More importantly, because of his lack of leadership, because he is a ditherer, we are now confronting a major problem with respect to the issue of unemployment. It requires decisive action. It requires the Prime Minister to revisit his budget strategy because, as Access Economics has assessed, despite the fact that his industrial relations and budget strategy has been factored in, it will result in Australia's having an unemployment rate of 9.2 per cent in the year 2001. Clearly, we cannot accept such a high level of unemployment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(4.40 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House today a particularly grievous matter: the current tensions affecting the pome fruit industry&mdash;that is, the apples, pears and nashi fruit that grow in such abundance and so lushly in the electorate of Murray. Murray is the food bowl of Australia with major dairying, beef and grain exporting industries. In particular, the Goulburn and Murray valleys produce most of Australia's processed fruit, and that includes some 90 per cent of the pear processing industry. Some 40 per cent of the pear crop is exported and the total farm gate value of the 120,000 to 160,000 tonnes of pears produced each year is some $77 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5333"> There is an enormous economic multiplier effect in this sort of industry. We have 4,000 people employed full time just in fruit processing and another 10,000 seasonally, but in the transport industry, which transports not only processed fruit but also the dairy pro duct, some 58 per cent of Shepparton's population is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A conservative estimate of the annual collective turnover of the transport companies is some $70 million. They pay $20 million for fuel and tyres each year. They use nearly 28 million litres of fuel annually. It is estimated that more than $31 million is spent on salaries and on costs in the transport industry alone, which is there because of the dairy, fruit processing and fresh fruit industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I began by saying we are under tension at the moment in the Murray and Goulburn valleys area. That is because right now our planning is on hold as we await the outcome of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service inquiry into the future of a 50&hyphen;year ban on fresh pome fruit imported from a country which is infected with the deadly bacterial disease apple and pear fire blight. Of course, we are obliged to undertake an investigation into any request that we lift a quarantine ban. It is right and proper that AQIS at the moment is pursuing this ban very carefully, but we are awaiting the outcome with bated breath, as you can well imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New Zealand first submitted a challenge to the ban on imported fresh apples from their country in 1986. It was modified again in 1989 and finally rejected by AQIS in 1990 because of a lack of scientific knowledge of the risks of fire blight being transferred on the apple fruit itself. Families like the Bolithos in my electorate&mdash;young, new generations wanting to go into the fruit growing industry like their fathers and grandfathers before them&mdash;are no longer pressing ahead with the planting of their 3,000 new apple trees. They will wait to see what the outcome of this inquiry is. They will hold off making their $50,000 investment because of the risk of Australia getting this disease into its pome fruit industry. The damage that would be done would be horrendous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fire blight is a bacterial disease that has been around for a very long time. In the 1700s it was first identified on crab&hyphen;apples in the New York state in North America. From there, it spread to Canada in the 1800s and into California. In the 1900s, the very early part of this century, tragically it reached New <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Zealand, probably on diseased fruit stock. By the 1940s, it was in the UK and had spread into Europe. Now it is right throughout Central and South America and it is in Scandinavia and the Middle East. In fact, the only countries which have a major pome fruit industry which are disease free when it comes to apple and pear fire blight are Australia and South Africa. You can imagine the competitive advantage freedom from that particular disease gives us currently in international world trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fire blight is an extremely destructive bacterial disease of pome fruit. The blossom infection causes severe reduction in the current year's crop and, as the fruit spurs are infected, the following year's crops are also reduced. A young tree, between one and four years, will probably die. The older trees linger on, but the effect is as if a fire has gone through the orchard, hence the name fire blight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How is the disease spread? Unfortunately, very simply. It is windborne. As well, the spores get lifted from tree to tree and blossom to blossom by insects such as bees&mdash;and, of course, we depend on those same bees for the fruit's very production. Any small cut or injury to the plant, like you get with pruning, easily allows this disease to enter the fruit tree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disease caused severe crop losses in Greece in 1987, just one year after its first record of occurrence in 1986. In the Sacramento Valley in California, which has conditions and climate just like ours in the Murray and Goulburn valleys, over 90 per cent of the Fresno and Kings County pear trees were just about wiped out to apple and pear fire blight just two years after the disease struck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, for us, this disease is virtually incurable. You can keep your trees going, however, albeit not at their peak production, with multiple sprays of things like antibiotics&mdash;sprays which are, of course, not legal in Australia. Besides, the costs of doing this spraying are phenomenal, not to mention the way you jeopardise your chemical free status in the world's international trade.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5334">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sacramento growers must apply some 25 copper and antibiotic sprays per year to their trees to fight this disease. The cost of this control is around $A3,800 per hectare. In the Murray and Goulburn valleys, where we do not have to do that sort of spraying, our costs are some 20 per cent of that sum&mdash;only $A765 per hectare. Quite clearly, if we had to start applying that sort of spraying regime, a lot of people would be out of business very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How much at risk are we of this disease? I have talked about how easily the small spores are transferred on the wind and by insects from tree to tree and blossom to blossom. But we are particularly at risk in my area&mdash;where, as I say, we have the fruit growing heart of Australia; the pome fruit growing heart in particular&mdash;because our climatic conditions are ideal for the establishment and the spread of this disease. We have the temperatures that the disease apparently seems to thrive in&mdash;24 to 29 degrees Celsius. We also have the soil conditions. Soils conducive to fire blight development are high in clay content, often poorly drained, highly acidic, low in potassium and heavily fertilised. They are the sorts of soils and conditions we have learnt to manage and flourish with in the Goulburn and Murray valleys. We have developed special pruning processes in our area, but every time you do massive pruning you risk entry of apple pear fire blight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, you can imagine the state of mind of our growers, our processors, our pickers and our packers in the Goulburn and Murray valleys as we await the outcome of this AQIS inquiry. You can imagine how we feel when we talk about our clean and green image for our fruit. In the backs of our minds we are wondering whether our island status that has kept us free of this disease is going to be enough in the future if imported fruit containers or leaf litter comes through from New Zealand carrying, accidentally of course, this deadly disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to undertake this inquiry. I have every confidence that AQIS will do a thorough and scientific job of evaluating the data. We have so much at risk. We know that the net returns for apple growers could fall by 25 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent and that net returns for pear growers could fall by up to 40 per cent, according to ABARE statistics, if this disease got into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know it could also affect our growing new ornamental tree business. We know it would affect our image and our status overseas. It is not enough to say, `But, hey, Japan takes New Zealand's apples.' We understand Japan rejected up to 60 per cent of New Zealand's apples in the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Speaker, you can see that we are concerned. We await the outcome of the AQIS inquiry. The industry in my electorate will do everything they can to assist AQIS by providing data. We can only hope that, in the future, we remain one of the two countries in the world left free of this devastating disease.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<ELECTORATE> (Namadgi)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.50 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this place today with a grievance that I think is a very important matter that must be brought to the attention of the House on behalf of the people of the ACT, particularly the people of the electorate that I represent&mdash;the seat of Namadgi. My grievance is the devastating effect of the policies of the Howard Liberal government on the Canberra community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this government has come to power, it has done nothing it seems but savage this local community in a way that has destroyed confidence in the business sector, destroyed confidence in the community sector and has got to a point where the ACT community now stands wringing its hands wondering what it can, in fact, do to start to recover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the 1993 election, the then deputy leader of the Liberals, Mr Peter Reith, went around the country claiming that if he was elected a Liberal government would `cut Canberra off at the knees'. This was a claim that was denied after it was said, but it was said and it is there for all to see in black and white.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this is one promise that the Liberal Party appears to have kept. When the Canberra community heard of core and non-core promises, they actually started to hope that maybe the `we'll cut Canberra off at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5335"> knees' statement had become a non&hyphen;core promise. But clearly that is not the case, and we are now starting to see the devastating effect in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look briefly at the economic devastation that this government has brought on the people of the electorate that I represent. Many members of the public and interested commentators are quickly coming to the conclusion that the greatest failure of this government is that it seems to be doing nothing to solve Australia's greatest economic and social problem of unemployment. In fact, its policies have contributed to increased unemployment in Canberra. The September ABS figures show this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September the ABS figures showed youth unemployment in Canberra as having exploded to an outrageous level of 54 per cent&mdash;54 per cent; we must keep saying it to believe it is possible. This is before the thousands of school leavers come onto the job market at the end of this year. We have a very high retention rate in our schools, something we are extremely proud of. But at the end of this year we will see a huge flow-on of students, a third of whom will go to university and the remaining two-thirds who will head out into the community hoping to set up a lifestyle and future for themselves. In the ACT at the moment, I am afraid to say that that will be very difficult for most of them to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the year to the end of September, total employment in the ACT declined from 159,500 to 154,900&mdash;it actually declined. What we need to be seeing is growth, not declining figures of that kind. People are becoming increasingly discouraged about the prospects of finding work, as evidenced by the fall in the participation rate from 74.3 per cent to 72.6 per cent. It is not just the size of the decline but the fact that the participation rate is dropping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future does not look too bright either, given that the government's own budget figures state that an additional 10,500 public service jobs will be cut from June 1996 to June 1997&mdash;and I should remind the House, with the greatest of respect, that this is over and above the tens of thousands of job cuts <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> announced already. We understand the need and the drive, I guess, if we have to be hard&hyphen;nosed about it, of this government wanting to cut back to small government. But the impact that has on a community like Canberra, given its role as the national capital, is devastating&mdash;and we must keep saying it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Job vacancies in the ACT, as measured by the ANZ job advertisement series, fell 10 per cent in September and public sector vacancies are now down 25 per cent. Can you believe, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in September in the ACT only 274 jobs were advertised&mdash;274, when we have an enormous figure of 54 per cent youth unemployment, let alone a local unemployment rate of around 8.9 per cent. For six of the seven months since this government was elected, job vacancies have actually fallen. The number of people working overtime and the amount of overtime for each worker have also fallen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The discretionary spending that families consider in their day-to-day lives has dropped dramatically in the ACT. I cannot move around my electorate without being constantly reminded of this&mdash;people in business, people in their own small businesses, people operating and working in our club industry and people generally saying to me, `When will we again be able to have confidence in believing we can acknowledge and see growth in front of us, and not declining figures?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then get to the subject of job training programs&mdash;something extremely important in a climate such as the one I am describing. While the government seems to have been very busy creating unemployment, it is not at all concerned about doing anything to reduce it&mdash;and we can look at the skillshare cuts. This is evidenced by the massive cuts to labour market programs, a good example being the highly successful skillshare program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, the Caloola Training Centre used to operate a variety of skillshare programs from a variety of locations. Since Minister Vanstone has taken charge, Caloola has been forced to severely cut back its operations&mdash;and this is despite the fact that, in the 1995-96 financial year, Caloola assisted over 1,000 long-term unemployed persons in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5336"> the ACT and Yass region through skillshare and other labour market programs. Programs such as skillshare have made the Caloola clients and clients at other similar services competitive in the labour market. Hundreds are in jobs today because of skillshare and other like programs of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An organisation like Caloola is a perfect place to go to get a barometer reading of what is really happening, particularly for the long-term unemployed or anyone in the unemployment market looking for work who may unfortunately have specific problems affecting them in their efforts to secure employment. You cannot help them by cutting back the funds that run programs like Caloola.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then have the CES and DSS. The government's planned creation of this wonderful thing called `the agency' to effectively replace the CES and DSS raises serious questions for job seekers in my electorate. I have already raised some of these concerns in this place, but I will continue to do so&mdash;and I do so again now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My constituents want to know whether this all singing, all dancing agency will actually do anything practical to help reduce unemployment. Will it effectively replace the agencies that are going to be amalgamated under it? Will unemployed clients still be able to deal personally with case managers, as they can at the moment; and will that be better? How will a touch&hyphen;screen referral service operate? My goodness, if they talk about some of the Caloola long-term unemployed people who have had problems in the past specific to themselves in securing employment, I cannot for the life of me understand how compassion will come out of a touch screen when they go into that office and try to find information about employment that they could possibly seek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will all the referrals be given centrally from this agency, or will these people have to travel from each EPE and PEPE&mdash;as they will be called under the new regime&mdash;to get their referral? Does that mean that, instead of going to one office to get their referrals to half a dozen different jobs, they may now need to go to half a dozen different places to get half a dozen referrals to half a dozen different jobs <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all over the same area at the same time? Efficiency I do not think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, in the case of my electorate, all indications are that the agency will be located outside of it. At the moment people in my electorate have their own local CES and DSS office, which is very useful for them in terms of geography, whereas the locating of that office outside of my electorate will leave a population of nearly 100,000 people without any direct local service at all. Whilst we are on that subject, it would be remiss not to mention that the elderly, the disabled and others will have to travel much further in the future to access the DSS type services they currently get locally. Will they be compensated for the extra costs that they will undoubtedly incur?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general business conditions facing the ACT at the moment are pretty depressing. According to the latest ACT Chamber of Commerce and Industry business expectation survey, there is not much optimism or confidence out there at all. The post-budget expectations survey of 700 ACT businesses revealed that local businesses expected economic performance to remain much flatter than the national average. The Vice President of the ACT Chamber of Commerce, Mr John Loutitt, is not confident of any improvement in the near future. He was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> last week as stating that `nothing much is going to change'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when we need to see growing confidence and growth in the local economy, we are seeing building approvals, from an all&hyphen;time high in November 1995, having fallen for six of the seven months since this government was elected. This government and the ACT government hand in hand are seemingly doing what they can to destroy the ACT local economy. I grieve for my electorate and I grieve for the people in it who need to access employment as well as a good, vital local economy. I urge this government to seriously reconsider its attack on the ACT community and all services within it.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise some very serious matters in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5337"> grievance debate concerning the operation of lakes Hume and Dartmouth and its effect on many people, and indeed the economy, in the Murray-Darling. Following torrential rain storms, the Lake Hume remedial works, which have been under way for about 12 months now on that 60&hyphen;year&hyphen;old dam, have uncovered another major problem as a result of which the Murray-Darling Commission had to arrange for the release of vast quantities of water from Lake Hume, commencing last week. That release is continuing on a daily basis in order to reduce the level of Lake Hume quickly so that the remedial works on the retaining wall near the embankment at the spillway can be undertaken, and hopefully completed by Christmas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lake Hume operates in partnership, if you like, with an even larger dam, Dartmouth dam. Dartmouth dam has also been overflowing for the last week or so because of the torrential rains. The net effect of the discharges, as a result of the remedial works and the need for the commission to change its strategy, is large downstream flooding on many farms and communities. The result of the discharge from Dartmouth dam, which feeds into Lake Hume, is that virtually the whole Mitta Valley is inundated. Of course, it is normal for it to be inundated at some time, but the inundation is of a nature that will be prolonged. The consequences to the farming operations in particular are disastrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Murray-Darling Commission is struggling to meet all of the challenges of this situation. I for one understand some of the complexities of those challenges; however, in the course of all of this there are many forgotten people. I am alarmed to see that the people involved in the downstream farming operations from Dartmouth have virtually been told by representatives of the Murray-Darling Commission that they will not be entitled to any assistance by reason of the inundation from Dartmouth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In simple terms, perhaps overly simple terms, what they are saying is that the release from Dartmouth&mdash;and, it follows, the retention of large amounts of water in Dartmouth before the rain so that the airspace was limited when the rain came&mdash;has nothing to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do at all with the operation, repair and remedial works at Lake Hume. The Murray-Darling Commission appears to be saying, therefore, that farmers who need some assistance in respect of the long-term inundation of their farms in the Mitta Valley will not be entitled to any assistance because of that fact and because the flooding is due to the normal operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The normal operation of Dartmouth and Lake Hume is as reservoirs to conserve water and for conservation and other purposes, not the operation that nature would have had had the dams not been built at all. We are talking about an operation that is not natural. Rather, it is a man-made operation, made as a result of value judgments of the various authorities that control the dam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my view that it is time for a total review of these decisions because I think, in essence, the people who are affected by the long-term inundation in the Mitta Valley as a result of Dartmouth are entitled to assistance and a review of the operation in the same way as those farmers are entitled to assistance if their farms are inundated by the long-term flooding below Lake Hume.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an announcement last week, which I welcomed, that farmers and communities affected by the long-term flooding down past Lake Hume will be entitled, subject to legal constraints, to put a claim forward for compensation there. That needs to be clarified. It is absolutely wrong and unjust that one section of the community has been thrust into a position of being told, `You are on your own,' while another section of the community has been told, `Yes, you may be able to get assistance provided you can establish certain legal parameters.' I think this is totally unsatisfactory. What we need is a new, fresh approach to the management and operation of Lake Hume and Dartmouth in respect of their roles in relation to the Murray-Darling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5338"> One of the ways towards a solution, which needs to be found urgently, is for a study to be done immediately to see whether the airspace&mdash;that is, the storage capacity of Dartmouth dam&mdash;should be and could be in creased and what the costs and implications of that would be. I believe that if that came up and was proven, it would give more storage capacity and flexibility to the Murray-Darling Commission to manage all of the resources and to hopefully cope with mother nature when she deals her cards as she always does&mdash;there is nothing we can do about that&mdash;in the decades ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment we are having frequent flooding in the lower area from Dartmouth in the Mitta Valley and we have many unhappy people beyond Lake Hume who also feel that the inundation from the operations and discharges there are not being made according to the right parameters. There are always trade-offs in these matters because conservation, irrigation, environmental factors and flood mitigation factors have to be taken account of. Of course, there also has to be regard to the economic situation of the communities involved in these massive storages. I therefore believe that we must have a proper review. I am deliberately not spelling out the type of review because this needs to be discussed in goodwill, by all parties involved, around the table to see what needs to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also suggest that some of the farms that are inundated in the Mitta Valley below Dartmouth are going to continue to be inundated for long periods in years to come. I suggest that it may be appropriate, where those farms and those families feel that they would like it, for the commission to acquire those properties on fair and just terms so that they become the property of the Crown. Therefore, the inundation would be something all of the governments involved would bear, rather than just these individual families. That would take pressure off and would give more flexibility in flood mitigation decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment the Murray-Darling Commission has to pull back sometimes on its desire to release water from Dartmouth because of the effect on some of the properties that are instantly flooded when that occurs for long periods. That needs to be reviewed as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the governments involved in the Murray-Darling should consider appointing a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suitable consultant to prepare a discussion paper on these matters so that the issues can be put forward. Each party can put their view of what they believe has been happening that should not have been happening and the ways in which this could be improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That discussion paper could then provide the basis for the urgent assessment by all the governments involved in the Murray-Darling Commission on the future operation. More importantly, on the justice and equity side, that needs to be addressed now. As I say, there are farmers, for example in the Mitta area, who have been told quite bluntly that they will not be entitled to any assistance at all. Yet their farms are inundated and will be for unnaturally long periods because of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission is saying that this has got nothing to do with the works at Lake Hume. My contention is that that should be assessed independently. I am not saying that that is wrong; I am saying that you cannot say that blandly in all the circumstances without it being tested. It should be tested in an open and frank way so that people feel that justice has been done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is that the commission, on the advice it received, kept the water back in Dartmouth while the works were going on at Lake Hume for the last year. They did that on the basis of needing to conserve the water for downstream irrigation and the communities that need that water. That is the normal operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the heavy downpours the wall cannot take the water and it has to be discharged because of the works that are going on, where the retaining wall and the embankment meet the spillway. There seems to me to be an inexplicable occurrence here that should be examined: why was the water held back for so long when if it was spilled earlier all concerned would have been less inundated by flooding? That is the view being put by many people. It needs to be tested independently. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) has raised some very serious issues. I share the concerns he has raised. In fact, a family friend of mine has moved down there and I have been copping it. I wish him well in his endeavours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Indi did mention flood mitigation. I did want to say to the honourable member that it comes as a great source of disappointment to me that the government has now removed at a Commonwealth level its involvement in urban flood mitigation. I was very pleased that I, along with some other members of the western suburbs of Sydney, had been involved in the flood mitigation program. Of course, that is being axed in this budget. Regrettably, at least one of the catchment management trusts had embarked on work in anticipation of future Commonwealth revenue. Some of these flood mitigation programs, even in urban areas, are quite large and it was a very sensible way to go about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do regret the fact that for western Sydney, which has in past years suffered some horrific urban flooding, the prospect of Commonwealth involvement in rectifying that problem is now zero as a result of the change in government. I sincerely hope that local and state governments will continue, but they cannot make up that shortfall. I just hope that there is no serious loss of life or property as a result of that unfortunate decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Sunday I was very pleased to attend the second Rooty Hill Festival. This is organised by the Rooty Hill Lions. I was very pleased that my friend Councillor Charlie Lowes, the Mayor of Blacktown City Council, was able to open the festival on behalf of the Lions. I thought this festival was better than the first one. Clearly it is going to go from strength to strength. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would particularly like to thank all the shopkeepers for their forbearance because the road was closed off. I congratulate those storekeepers who participated in the festival. I hope in the future we will see this festival grow from strength to strength and that we will get even more involvement from the residents of Rooty Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know this is a grievance debate, but I again want to report something happy to the parliament. I attended the wedding of Henry and Leanne Kiwarkis. It was the first Assyrian wedding I have been to. I think one of the privileges of being a federal member of parliament, particularly out in the western suburbs of Sydney, is your exposure to different cultures and traditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that an Assyrian wedding is a small one if you have 200 guests. Henry and Leanne had something like 600 guests attend their wedding. In terms of proverbial lateness of the bride and groom, they turned up at the reception, which was supposed to start at 5 o'clock, at 8 o'clock. Be that as it may, it was a most enjoyable event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to reflect that our more traditional English or European style weddings are very reserved and conservative affairs compared with the wholesale involvement of all people at the wedding on this occasion. I was impressed that some of the relatives had travelled from Lebanon, Sweden, the United States and South Africa to attend the wedding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very important day for both Henry and Leanne, and I wish them very well in their married life. I know that they have purchased a place in Minchinbury in my electorate. I sincerely hope to serve them well as their federal member. I know that Henry's father, Eddie, was very proud on the day, as was his good wife. I am sure the couple will do well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also on Sunday, I was in my office fairly early reading a letter from a constituent of mine from Minchinbury. She is a single mother. She photocopied a photo of her son, Nathan, which was pretty unusual, but I thought it was really great. I do not know whether you are aware of this, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the Hebrew meaning of Nathan <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5340"> is gift of God, and, clearly, Nathan meant a lot to his mum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She wrote to me about child care and the impact the changes to child care is going to have on her ability to give Nathan the quality of life that he deserves. His mum is a working mother, and she is very proud that she is a single working mother trying to raise Nathan on her own. She was very concerned about the loss of operational subsidies and wanted me to know the impact it was going to have on her, that she would find it very difficult to meet any increased charges. Of course, with the loss of the operational subsidies, changes have been made to the child&hyphen;care cash rebate so that, again, she will be faced with increased charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate covers two local government areas: Penrith and Blacktown. If you are talking to Penrith councillors, they will say that they are the child&hyphen;care capital of New South Wales and have the most child&hyphen;care places. Blacktown equally claims the same distinction. It would be prudent of me not to even mediate on this issue but to just acknowledge that both councils have given a real commitment to providing community based child&hyphen;care services for their ratepayers. So this letter from Nathan's mum really is going to reverberate within Blacktown and Penrith, or, if you like, within the federal electorates of Greenway, Chifley and Lindsay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that we have in abundance in western Sydney is young people. I always refer to these people as our richest resource. It is a real tragedy that women who make a decision&mdash;for a variety of reasons, mostly to do with family income&mdash;to go to work and who need to place their children in child care are either going to be precluded because of increased charges from placing their children in child care or, alternatively, are going to be facing increased charges. This is going to have a real impact on families in the western suburbs of Sydney, in my electorate and, indeed, in the neighbouring electorate of Lindsay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Whilst in my office&mdash;I had been a bit tardy in returning some telephone calls; I sincerely apologise for that&mdash;I rang someone from my electorate in Doonside who was most con cerned about the increase in the prescription charges. This person happened to be someone on a disability pension. The cost of medication has been increased by 50c. The threshold where you start to get free medication has been increased by a further $26. This person was most upset about this increased charge and the other imposts on pensioners as a result of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He really was getting stuck into me, saying, `You guys in the opposition have really got to put it to the government.' It is ironic that if a Labor government had tried to increase the prescription charge by 50c without increasing the pension, we would have had speech after speech from members opposite about how inhumane we were and how outrageous it was. But they have done it, and they have not compensated for it. They do not understand what the impact will be on people with disabilities, like those in my constituency, or indeed, aged pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, there is the increase in the home and community service charges. Charges for meals on wheels, getting your lawns done or being bathed by volunteers are going to increase. I would say that when you increase them like that, you actually start putting a question mark over whether or not these people are going to avail themselves of the services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the House and the Parliament of Australia to the appalling state of the western and inland areas of Australia. The great tragedy that is occurring out there is simply not being addressed by this place. It is with great regret that I say that. I can only hope desperately that over the next two years of the life of this parliament and this government we will come to address these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me start by quoting cattle numbers for Australia. In 1976, there were 33.4 million head of cattle. In 1995, that figure had fallen to 25.7 million only&mdash;a fall of 30 per cent. In <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5341"> 1990, 1.1 million tonnes of wool were shorn. In 1996, only 0.64 million tonnes will be shorn&mdash;a fall of 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That means heartbreak, loss of stations, families who have been on those stations for generations being forced off, the collapse of our towns, the loss of population in our towns and the removal of essential services from those towns. We have been waiting 10 months for a doctor in Aramac, just to give one example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me move on. The suicide rate for Australian men in the 15&hyphen; to 25-year-old age bracket has trebled since 1964. Put to that the fact that in rural areas the suicide rate for this cohort of the population is 50 per cent higher in rural areas than in urban areas&mdash;25 per 100,000 in urban areas and 38 per 100,000 in rural areas&mdash;and we see a situation that is reflecting itself in the most brutal of manners and the most brutal of statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1961 the population of inland Queensland was 81,733. In 1994 that figure had gone down to 80,542. It had declined. East of the coastal ranges the population had risen from 1.5 million to 3.1 million in that same period. Whereas the coast had a population growth&mdash;God bless them&mdash;of 107 per cent, the west had a population decline of 1.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening in Australia today is that we are depopulating the surface area of this continent. I am pleased to see the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in the House. He is in charge of one of those six electorates. Mr Scott would be well aware of the fact that in those six, arguably seven, electorates that cover almost the entire surface area of Australia&mdash;82 per cent of the surface area of Australia&mdash;the population is only 3.3 per cent of the population of Australia. Whilst the electorates of Leichhardt and Kennedy cover huge areas and we do have big populations, almost all of the population of Kennedy is within 50 to 60 kilometres of the coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When my father was elected to this House he did not reach the coast at all. The pernicious institution of this so-called one vote, one value sees my electorate some 20 per cent bigger in population. I see the member for Brisbane smiling.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answers are out there and the answers are out there right now. Twenty per cent of the world's wool is being put on the market by the Australian government&mdash;in fact, through the Australian stockpile. Clearly, if that 20 per cent of the supply of wool was cut off and put on the market by our socialist predecessors in office, the price of wool would rise, and rise dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who is in the House today, say on occasions that we should have a trigger price on the stockpile. I have heard his colleague the state member of parliament, Howard Hobbs, say the same thing on many occasions. It is a viewpoint with which I concur with  great commitment. We have the wherewithal to take 20 per cent of the world's source of wool off the world market. That would drive the price through the roof, as it did effectively when Doug Anthony introduced that magnificent scheme in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the world's coffee producers removed some 17 per cent of coffee production off the world stage, the price for coffee rose 60 per cent. When some 10 per cent of world aluminium production was removed from the world market, the price for aluminium went up nearly 50 per cent. We saw a similar figure with the OPEC countries. They have not been able to succeed very much recently, but not so long ago they succeeded in withdrawing 10 per cent from the world market and the price of oil went up some 30 per cent. In every single case that you wish to quote, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5342"> where you are able to cut off the supply of a significant amount of a product coming on to the world market, not surprisingly, it has the effect of driving the price upwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the assistance being given to us at present; heaven only knows, I suppose we need it. The effect of the interest rate subsidy is not to help us; it is to help the banks of Australia. The banks of Australia have money with them earning seven per cent interest, yet they are parcelling that money out to the farming sector of Australia for interest rates of between 12 and 15 per cent. The housing market in Australia, however, is able to enjoy rates of about 8&frac34; per cent at the moment. Our international competitors in the farming sector, for example in the United States, are enjoying interest rates of around six or seven per cent at present. It is impossible for us to compete on the world stage in light of these facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the interest rates were brought down to where they should be in line with the interest rates of some of our trading partners&mdash;Japan has an interest rate of around four per cent, Germany's is around five or six per cent the last time I looked and America's is about seven or eight per cent&mdash;of course the Australian dollar would fall, as it did when our interest rates were at a sensible level back in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Australian dollar was allowed to free&hyphen;fall in 1986, the value of the Australian dollar went down to 59c. If the value went down to 59c at present, the electorate of Kennedy would enjoy an extra $1,000 million a year of income. So effectively we are being cheated of $1,000 million of income because of the artificially high price of the Australian dollar. Heaven only knows, if you are trading each month at a deficit of $1.5 billion, surely your dollar should be falling, not rising, as it is at present. But it is being propped up by a precedent created by the socialist government of extremely high interest rates. We are advocating a dramatic change in your policy. You people inflicted this pain upon Australia. You have destroyed these industries. We are now attempting to argue how we should go about restoring them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interest rates are an enormous burden upon the farming sector of Australia because our debts are huge, and growing every single day. Unless the interest rates come down, some 20 per cent of the pastoralists in the state of Queensland most certainly will not be there in five years time. It is argued that as high a figure of 23 per cent of the pastoral sector will simply not be there unless those interest rates are reduced. The subsidy at the moment is going to the banks, not to the farmers. The farmers are coming down to eight per cent and that is what is enjoyed by every householder in Australia who is borrowing money. If we have an approach used and advocated by Senator Bill O'Chee, I am quite certain that we can rescue at least 15 per cent of those 20 per cent of people who at present have no future and turn around those ugly statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some $400 million to $500 million worth of water projects in North Queensland and inland Queensland that are on the drawing board at the moment by the state government with their very wonderful $1,000 million project for water development in the state of Queensland. If those projects come on stream at Ravenshoe and Hells Gates&mdash;north of Charters Towers&mdash;Pentland, mid&hyphen;west at Richmond, Einasleigh, Winton, Muttaburra and Longreach, we will be bringing into the Australian economy an extra $450 million per year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I continue my remarks. Some parts of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 have particular interest to women. There is one issue in particular that I want to raise today and that is in schedule 12&mdash;amendments relating to widows and partners. In large part, Labor supports the amendments made by this schedule which extend eligibility for the widow allowance and partner allowance&mdash;measures to achieve consistency between these two payments in respect of definition of recent labour force experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, of course, the case that the widow B pension was already being phased out. But we are concerned that this government is now phasing it out faster. In fact, it is no longer what I would call a phasing out. From 20 March next year, it will be gone: there will be no new grants. What we have established from Senate estimates is that there will be losers from the automatic transfer to the age pension at age pension age. This is because, at the same time as doing this, women over the age pension age will no longer be able to claim payments like the widow allowance or partner allowance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment that has already been proposed, schedule 5, corrects what we can only assume is an unintended consequence of the way this measure is presented in the bill. There is no doubt that there will be women, a small number, who will not qualify for the age pension because of the residency requirements attached to this payment and who will also be unable to claim any other payment except special benefit. If the Labor amendment is supported, these women, many from non-English speaking backgrounds, will continue to have access to other income support options. I hope that, in the course of this debate, the government will support the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my opening remarks, and as my colleague the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) has already stated, Labor will also be opposing that part of the bill which would limit arrears of the child disability allowance to three months. Again, Labor has subjected this measure to some scrutiny through the Senate estimates process. What we have found through that process is that around 75 per cent of new claims for the child disability allowance currently include arrears of more than three months. That is around 11,000 people per year&mdash;a very significant number of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course these are the losers under this measure. Eleven thousand people per year who have a disabled child, who have carried the costs and the worry of having a disabled child, who have had to rearrange their lives to ensure that their children have the best possible care and attention&mdash;these are the people who now may not know about the existence of the child disability allowance or who may not have found out about it until after many, many months or even years of looking after their children, and who also may not be fully aware of the extent of the disability of their child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arrangement whereby the child disability allowance arrears of up to 12 months could be paid was some compensation for this situation. We are very concerned that there is no policy imperative from the government to introduce such a measure. There is no recognition by this government&mdash;I would have to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5344"> say it is a very mean&hyphen;spirited government&mdash;that people who have children with a disability might actually merit some special treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Social Security, when questioned in Senate estimates, argued that knowledge of this payment is now widespread and that parents are alerted to the existence of the payment by the medical profession or disability support groups. The department is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . pretty confident that families with a child with a disability are alerted now very early in the process about their entitlements to payment and come in and make a claim well before they used to.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet we know that three&hyphen;quarters of new claims are cases where parents are not claiming within three months. Seventy&hyphen;five per cent of new grants include arrears for more than three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the faster phase&hyphen;out of the widow B pension, this measure is yet another example of this government attacking those who are the most vulnerable in our community. I hope that, in having these problems pointed out, the government will not continue with this very mean change that exists in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three other measures in this social security bill that I would like to comment on&mdash;three measures that can only mean that the government is not serious about getting people back to work. Only a government that did not care about encouraging people to return to work would make these three changes. The first is that schedule 10 abolishes the earnings credit scheme. The Labor Party will be opposing this measure and will oppose it for two reasons. First and foremost, the earnings credit scheme actually encourages people to get back to work. Secondly, the coalition, in its pre&hyphen;election social security policy, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People who are unemployed should be given every incentive to work. If a person is not able to find full&hyphen;time work, he or she may be able to obtain part&hyphen;time work. Part&hyphen;time work will supplement the person's income, provide employment skills and assist the transition back into the full&hyphen;time work force&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and here it comes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The earnings credit scheme will be retained by a Coalition Government. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Yet we see in this bill another direct broken promise, another clear betrayal of the Australian people, another clear betrayal of people who are unemployed and are trying to get back to work&mdash;yet another one. These arrangements, which were introduced by Labor, gave pensioners and allowees an incentive to take up casual or temporary work that became available, allowing them to supplement their payments without immediately or necessarily reducing their level of payment. Now people may be deterred from taking up this kind of employment, making their attachment and relationship to the labour force even more marginal&mdash;a very serious change indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that 121,900 people per year are expected to receive a reduction in payment for periods of time, saving the government $259 million over four years. Where does the saving come from? This $259 million is, of course, going to come from the pockets of those who actually want to work, those who, from this measure, were able to find work and continue to take up casual and part&hyphen;time work. Now they may not. The government savings will be of that level only if, in fact, people do not take up work and continue to rely on unemployment benefits. Many people are just not able to get full&hyphen;time and ongoing work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue I want to talk about is schedule 11, which abolishes the employment entry payment for all social security recipients and also abolishes the education entry payment for all non&hyphen;pensioners. Once again, we will be opposing these measures. Let us look at what the coalition's pre&hyphen;election social security policy said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To assist people to make the transition from being unemployed to work or education&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and here it comes again&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Coalition will maintain the current employment and education entry payments.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet another measure that breaks promises and yet another broken promise to unemployed people who are trying to get back into work or education. It is the case that, on entering employment, most social security recipients encounter considerable costs that go with getting a job, whether it is getting clothes that are suitable for going to work, payment of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5345"> child care or transport costs, or even getting a haircut. All these things are very expensive for people who may have been on benefits for a considerable period. Now they will not get that extra bit of support that these payments help people with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The costs are particularly high for disability pensioners who might have to purchase additional supports or require attendant care to go to work. They will not get the bit of extra support that was available to them when we had these two payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it surprising that the government has abolished the education entry payment. It is also the case, if you have been on benefits for a certain period and you have finally got back into education, that you are going to need to purchase textbooks, stationery, equipment and supplies. No longer will you have any extra assistance from the government because the education entry payment for non&hyphen;pensioners has been abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two payments, which were introduced by Labor and were a recognition of the costs of getting back into work and education, and which gave assistance to removing barriers to people who were trying to get employment or education, have now been removed. I draw the House's attention to the fact that it was not just Labor that supported these changes. Let us go to the origin of these two excellent priorities&mdash;the employment and education entry payments&mdash;and have a look at the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS>, a cross&hyphen;party committee report which had members involved from both sides of the House. They recognised that, on entering employment, most social security recipients encounter considerable costs associated with the purchase of clothes suitable for work force participation and the payment of child care and transport costs and that costs of entering training or employment are particularly high for invalid pensioners who may have to purchase additional supports or require attendant care&mdash;just the sort of issue that we are trying to recognise by amending this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are very serious changes that are going to mean that people will have to stay <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on benefits much longer than they want to&mdash;people who want to get back to work, people who want to get back into employment and education. What the government wants to do is blame unemployed people and tell them it is their own fault, that they are going to be checked up on, that really they do not want to get a job, they just need greater forms of inspection and control over their lives. That is not the case. The vast majority of people on unemployment benefits want to get back to work and it was exactly these schemes that were helping them to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the government will see that these are very serious changes that should be reversed so that we can make sure that those people who want to work get a bit of assistance. These are not measures that cost the government or our country a lot of money. What costs the government and the country a lot of money is having people unemployed or out of the education system when they want to be employed or want to get further education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the government to reverse all of these changes and to take Labor's amendment on the widow B pension, to reverse the decision on the child disability allowance and to make sure that we still have the education entry payment, the employment entry payment and the earnings credit scheme.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 is certainly fundamental to this government's program. We have heard a lot in this debate. We have not debated this bill since last Thursday because there has been so much filibustering in the time in between which has delayed this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has already committed $48 billion to the social security budget for the 1996-97 year, or 37 per cent of all budget expenditure. That equates to $2,500 for every man, woman and child in Australia. So, if we are going to divide it up that way, $2,500 will be expended on every person in Australian society today. It is an enormous amount of money. It is the job of any federal government of any colour to ensure that that amount <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5346"> of money is spent wisely and it is accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should look at the social security system that Australia has developed over the years before we look at this bill in detail. Australia's welfare system started at around the turn of the century with the establishment of the old age and invalid pensions. Our next major welfare measure was the wide&hyphen;ranging welfare measures introduced for returned servicemen as part of the Department of Repatriation in 1918. It was further comprehensively increased in the 1940s when we created benefits for children, widows, the unemployed, the sick and those in special circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The social security system has continued to change and evolve ever since. It is important to remember when you look at this bill and subsequent social security bills which will inevitably be introduced into this place that social security, the thought behind social security and the means by which it is to be funded are always evolving and changing. The term `social security' was first used only in 1935 by the Roosevelt administration. So it is not as though it has been with us for hundreds of years. It is a relatively new term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to understand where Australia sits with social security. There are two systems widely recognised throughout the world. There is the universal social security system. Places like Sweden have that system. It predominantly says that the benefits are available to all citizens. We do not have that sort of a system in Australia. We do not have a tax system to support it either. We have what is known as a residual system where government intervention to enhance the welfare of citizens is limited and occurs only when the private market and the family are not able to produce the desired outcome. That is considerably different from the universal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that a social security system in this nation must be flexible, adaptable, equitable, responsible and, above all else, accountable. The measures being introduced today go a long way towards ensuring that our social security system, our social security net for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those most in need, will meet those requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin), who opened this debate on behalf of the opposition, spoke of the successes of the previous government in maintaining the adequacy of the basic social security safety net. He talked about targeting assistance and continually improving compliance measures. That is exactly what this bill is aimed at doing. Savings are achieved mainly through measures to target assistance to the most needy and tightening administration. He indicated pride in the low administrative costs of Australia's social security system when compared with overseas arrangements. This bill makes administration costs even lower. So we have bipartisan support there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) spoke about this same theme. The terms he used throughout his speech were `nasty' and `vicious'. He referred to this as being `a nasty, mean and vicious exercise'. He used combinations of those three terms throughout his entire speech. Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that they are not the emotive terms that we should be using when referring to Australia's social security safety net. I think a more responsible level of debate is required if we are going to come to the conclusions that we inevitably must do&mdash;that Australia requires a safety net for its poor and for those who cannot look after themselves in any adequate form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Newcastle spoke about the widows pension. He suggested that the measures relating to widows and partners could not really be assisting widows because we are expected to yield $22 million. He said this $22 million was being taken off widows and partners, but that is just simply not the fact. The fact is that those savings are almost entirely from savings in administration. Wasted money; money that the opposition, the then Labor government, really took no note of. That $22 million can be better spent delivering services rather than administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I turn to some of the measures that are contained in the bill. There are some 24 schedules in the bill. I would like to speak briefly today on some of them. The first one <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5347"> increases the flexibility of the carers pension. I think everyone in this House would agree that Australia is a better place because of those people who undertake to help those less fortunate in the community as carers. I acknowledge the valuable work that carers do throughout this nation. They create a better quality of life for the people they are caring for and they also take a burden away from the public purse. They should be commended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has two measures which will assist them. One measure extends the number of hours they can do in paid or voluntary work from 10 to 20 hours per week. The second measure increases the number of days that a carer may temporarily cease caring in a calendar year without affecting their qualifications for the carers pension from 42 days to 52 days. I hope that in future bills addressed in this House carers will be even more considered in relation to the social security safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 3 deals with the payment to under 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds of the sickness allowance, newstart allowance and youth training allowance. This very much goes to responsibility. If a young person becomes ill and is in a household where the household can afford to look after them, I would put it to you that, under our residual social security system, that is a reasonable thing to expect. The taxpayer, the government, will pick up the tab for those people whose parents are unable to assist them, but the measure is in place so that those who are able to look after themselves, in fact, do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 4&mdash;a very important one&mdash;deals with voluntary work participation for unemployed people. We have heard the opposition speak long and hard about this particular measure, saying that it somehow is going to disadvantage them. They have asked: how could we possibly say that allowing people to do voluntary work was somehow going to assist them when we were, in fact, making savings in this area? Anybody who has studied unemployed people for any length of time will understand the difficulties and the health problems that these people incur after they have found themselves out of work for any considerable time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will not only assist the unemployed person to regain self-esteem to feel part of the community but also assist voluntary organisations which play such an important part in our community. It will create a sense of worth for those people who are unemployed and, above all else, it will give them the leg up, so to speak, in order to get back into the work force. I am sure that many people in this place, like myself, have been told by unemployed people that, if only they were given the chance to do some voluntary work, they could prove to employers that they had the necessary skills and that they could work. By working for voluntary groups, they will get just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, the member for Newcastle had comments to make in this area. He questioned the government's proposal in relation to voluntary work, asking how those people doing voluntary work could be better off if the government expected to save on allowance expenditure. He obviously has not worked it out that, if people are improving their likelihood of work and they get into work, we have to pay fewer benefits. It is not that difficult to understand that if a person is doing something which improves their likelihood of getting back into the work force and that they then do so, the government will not be spending as much on unemployment benefit, but that seems to have escaped the member for Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 5 is in direct response to the commitments we made to the people, and that was the government's commitment to improve and tighten the activities test. We do not run away from this measure. I think it is very important that we do that. It is important that those people who are in need can access our social security system and that those who are blatantly abusing taxpayers' money should be more responsible and, in fact, should be rejected from the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to talk a little bit about this activities test and a few of the measures contained within. We have tightened the definition for `unsuitable work'. At the moment most Australians are of the understanding that, if you reject work, you will be thrown off unemployment benefit. That, in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5348"> fact, is not true. The fact is that people can say that the work certainly is not suitable for them and that that is a valid reason. Whilst there are limitations to that, we are tightening that criterion to ensure that it is fair for all. We have changed the non-payment period for the activity test to six weeks for the first breach and 13 weeks for subsequent breaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone taking money from the public purse because they are unemployed has a responsibility to the people of Australia to ensure they fulfil their end of the bargain. Their end of the bargain is that they should be actively looking for work or undergoing training. If they fail to turn up at a place of training, if they fail to fill out the unemployment diaries for their activities test, they have breached what I believe is their fundamental responsibility in receiving that money, and, obviously, they will be penalised in an appropriate manner. No-one who is responsible, who goes to the system genuinely looking for work, is going to be disadvantaged in any way, shape or form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also tightening the activities test breach provisions relating to voluntary unemployment and the refusal of a job offer. This is aimed, I believe, mainly at prevention. I would like to relay a story about a young man who is a couple of years younger than myself. He was a public servant some 12 years ago. At that time, he came home from work and he said to his parents, `That's it. I've tossed it in. I'm not going to back to work.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Twelve years later that man is still unemployed. The difference is that today he is unemployable. He has been sent to a TAFE college in the last couple of months to learn how to get back into society, let alone how to get back into the work force. He had a good job with the Public Service. He said to his parents at the time, `I am going to get back some of my taxes.' If this measure prevents even one person from doing that, it will have saved a young person's life, who otherwise has wasted 12 years of his youth sitting at home and becoming a recluse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also extended the non-payment period, from 12 weeks to 26 weeks, for moving to an area of lower employment prospects. I would put it to you once again <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that anybody moving from Brisbane, for argument's sake, to the Sunshine Coast is not serious about work but wants to be comfortable where they are being unemployed. They are not serious about their job prospects but about perhaps the quality of their leisure time. This will not disadvantage people who wish to move to be with family, and it will not disadvantage people who have to move because of illness. Perhaps they have asthma and the area is not conducive to improving that illness. So, once again, you can see compassion being brought in here&mdash;the system being adaptable and flexible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in this area we are clarifying the operation of the employer's contact certificate provisions. This will further protect genuine job seekers, who go along to get an appointment for a job and find that the employer is being unreasonable. By doing this, we are ensuring that those people who are genuinely looking for work will be looked after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 7 relates to the waiting periods before you can access the social security system. I put it to you that, if someone were working for BHP or at the local pharmacy or anywhere else and they go on holidays and take paid leave, they cannot access the social security system. If they take paid sick leave, they cannot access the social security system or maternity leave or long service leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why is it that at the end of their time of employment when those benefits are cashed out they can then go immediately&mdash;or almost immediately under the present system&mdash;on to the social security system? It is not equitable that those people&mdash;having had that cash in the hand and, for all intents and purposes, being paid to work&mdash;should be accessing taxpayers' money during that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned earlier, this goes to responsibility: to people being responsible for their own decisions and not simply putting a hand out because there is a social security system there. I remind you that we are here with a residual social security system where the private market and the family are not able to produce the desired outcome. This is not a universal social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same measure also goes towards moves to make more equitable the current liquid <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5349"> assets period. Currently, a person who has $5,000 or a couple which has $10,000 cannot access the system for four weeks, but it makes no provision for someone who has $50,000 worth of liquid assets. The penalty, so to speak, or the period in which they are unable to access the system, is no different, so we are making that more equitable to ensure that it reflects the real amount of money that people have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 8, relating to sickness, newstart and youth training allowances, ensures that the system becomes more economical and easier to administer, both for the staff and for the recipients. Schedule 9 also shows that the system has to change and evolve. By this particular schedule we will allow people to phone in when they are on sickness benefits, ensuring that they are not disadvantaged unnecessarily. As the system is now, they may, due to illness, be unable to attend an office. It is not all a one&hyphen;way street, as those opposite may like to paint it. It is, in fact, a system which is changing and evolving, and it reflects the needs of the Australian social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple more schedules that I will speak on briefly. Schedule 15 relates to compensation. In no other part of the social security system is anyone&mdash;other than aged pensioners&mdash;who receives a compensation payment, including a component for economic loss, able to access the social security system during that period which has been set down. This has now been extended to include those persons on the age pension. If they receive a compensation payment which includes a component for economic loss, that will be taken into account when looking at their eligibility for the age pension. Schedule 17 is very reasonable, and I think it has been received quite well by those opposite as well. The health benefits card and the health care card are to be combined, which will mean fewer administrative costs. There will be only one card and less confusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 21 contains the amendments relating to debt recovery. This particular measure relates to the fact that, if you go along to an automatic teller machine and it spits out $50 notes as opposed to $20 notes&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some chap had that happen to him the other day&mdash;and you do not do anything about it, then you can find yourself in trouble with the law for fraud if you did not notify what happened. We presently have a social security system where the staff are dealing with literally millions of claims every week. If they make a mistake in your favour, in some instances we are not able to recover that debt&mdash;debt owing to the taxpayer. Schedule 21 tightens that situation to ensure that it no longer happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) spoke about two payments that have been removed, one of which is the payment to enable people to access and get into the education system. She referred to the fact that pensioners were not being excluded. The fact is that yes, these payments received bipartisan support in the employment, education and training committee, but time has gone on and we found that these systems are not necessarily being utilised by all. In particular, one section is being used by sole parents, and the sole parents benefit has been retained for them. But others were not necessarily being used and there was no anecdotal evidence to suggest that they would encourage people to get into work. They have been removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that we are targeting, once again, just what the member for Sydney said right at the outset we should be targeting. He said that we should be targeting assistance and we should ensure that the compliance costs continue to come down. Social security was once defined by a learned gentleman as being&mdash;I will find my quote here in a moment. I seem to have lost it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Social Security Amendment Bill 1996 ensures that our social security system is more flexible and more adaptable and that it is targeted to those who are genuinely in need.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the run&hyphen;up to the election the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made much of the statement that he would lead a government that would promise to govern for all of us. This is a promise that has been echoed since the election. But I think that analysis of the budget proves that nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many losers in the first Howard&hyphen;Costello budget, amongst whom are those that receive assistance under the social security system. In fact, one might observe that there are no greater losers than those that receive assistance under the social security system. The debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 is about the sort of Australia that we want to see and that we want to live in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is the first ideologically driven step in an assault on the social safety net that underpins our society. The ideology that underpins that assault is no different from that implemented by Margaret Thatcher in Great Britain or by Ronald Reagan and the Republican Right in America. As time goes by in those two countries we see the unravelling of the effect of those measures and a return to values that give a community benefit to people that are in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this is a measure that is about dismantling the welfare state. It is about changing the sort of Australia in which we live, and I do not believe this is an exaggerated claim. As a result of this budget, no longer do the unemployed have guaranteed access to labour market assistance services. The Commonwealth Employment Service and its historic mission have been abolished. Due to the impact of savage cuts, hundreds of thousands of Australians will simply miss out, or rather <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they will be screened out by a mean&hyphen;spirited instrument known as a capacity to benefit. In the area of social security, there are over 30 changes which, as ACOSS has concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will impact harshly on social security clients. The impact is particularly strong when combined with measures announced in other portfolios such as the cuts to labour market programs, abolition of the dental health scheme and increased pharmaceutical costs.</PARA>
<PARA>Many of these 30 changes are pernicious, some are just simply bad policy. Take, for example, the abolition of the earnings credit scheme. The earnings credit scheme was introduced in 1991 to assist people with fluctuating incomes from casual or short-term work. The scheme allowed people to accrue earnings credits up to approximately $1,100 for individuals and $2,200 for couples during periods when they were not exceeding the income free zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They could then use that earnings credit during a time when they had an opportunity for some short&hyphen;term or casual work. The account credit was reduced every time the person exceeded the income free zone without affecting that person's entitlement to benefit. In other words, the scheme provided a mechanism for people to spread the income from short&hyphen;term paid work over a longer period and thereby not immediately affect their pension entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was good policy because it acted as an incentive for people to take casual or short&hyphen;term work. As ACOSS concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Abolition of this scheme is an illogical and counterproductive move. It will act as a disincentive to unemployed people seeking casual or temporary work. It may also lead to people being reluctant to declare income.</PARA>
<PARA>All the trends indicate that part-time and casual labour will become an increasing feature of the Australian economy into the next century. The policy and, from time to time, utterances of the government assume the reverse. In assuming the reverse, much of the policy decisions being made by the government are bad because they have to understand the reality of the developing labour market, the reality that people will be more inclined to go into part-time and casual labour. In fact, the notion of full-time employment as we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5351"> knew it, as people of our age when they left education knew it, is ever changing. It is the nature of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example of bad policy&mdash;an attack on unemployed people seeking to return to work or to go on to education&mdash;is the abolition of entry payments. These payments were introduced in recognition of the fact that starting a job or commencing a course involves up-front costs. They could be tools, clothes, books, fares and many other things. The fact is that, when a decision was made to introduce the entry payments, it was in recognition that there were disincentives because people had to pay up-front costs to go into employment. This move was to ease that burden. The employment entry payment is paid to people on newstart and jobstart who have been registered with the CES for 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most significant example of bad policy, and of policy which is driven by crude political ideology, is the so-called tightening of compliance. A defining feature of many modern conservatives is the practice of blaming the victims. This ability to regard welfare recipients as potential frauds was at the base of the Fraser government's concerted and callous attacks on what were called dole bludgers. The bad old days are back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This social security budget is based on a fiction that an overwhelming majority of people who are in receipt of pensions and benefits are frauds. This is the sort of frightening populism that might make good copy for some television current affairs; it might go down well at Liberal and National Party branch meetings, but it is a myth. The government proposes to save $345 million over the next four years by tightening compliance&mdash;in other words, by eliminating fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth pointing out that this is only slightly more modest than its outrageous claims made during the election campaign that it would save $180 million from eliminating fraud and $331 million from better compliance over three years. This means the government is claiming that one in every seven unemployed persons is guilty of fraud and will have their benefits cut off.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the electorate of Scullin the government's actions will force about 800 people off unemployment benefit. Overwhelmingly, these will be people who deserve and need income support, but they will be branded dole cheats. These people will pay the price of the government's ideology. They will pay it because the government has ignored the fact that since the early 1980s the Labor governments progressively tightened eligibility and compliance measures. The government has ignored the fact that in 1993 a major study of the social security system by a visiting fellow at the Australian National University, Professor Richard Weatherby, found:</PARA>

<PARA>You cannot get any clearer than that, but the government has pressed on regardless. It is the unemployed who are going to pay for this mismatch between ideology and reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hardships and absurdities created by the introduction of the dole diary have been highlighted by a social worker in my electorate. These comments from a public letter are worth quoting at length. In this letter, the local youth worker says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If one accepts that it is a right for everyone to have an opportunity to work and receive remuneration for services and skills rendered, then it is a reasonable expectation that financial support is provided to the nation's workforce when full employment cannot be provided.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Most members of the House would agree with that statement. But, having made that statement, the way in which those benefits are administered and implemented is very important. The youth worker goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effects of unemployment on the morale and self confidence of the country is well documented and it is right that employment generation by the government and businesses be a top priority. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5352"> </PARA>
<PARA>As we continue to say as an opposition, the most important policy direction that is required at the moment is employment creation. The youth worker continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the activity test which has been recently introduced as a condition of recipients of jobsearch, newstart or the youth training allowance is an exercise in absurdity. The test consists of unemployed people providing details of attempts to gain employment in each fortnight period, through the use of a diary to record up to eight employment inquiries. This will be in order for recipients to continue to receive benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>The youth worker goes on to say that the absurdity lies in a number of different directions. There is the effort that the unemployed person will have to put in for compliance. There is the increased administrative effort required by DSS, CES or whatever body will be put in place to administer this. There is also the expectation that people, as part of fulfilling the conditions and getting the eight contacts, will continue to cold canvass. That is not to say that some unemployed people do not have success from cold canvassing, but it has to have some rhyme or reason behind it. It cannot simply be done just to clock up one of these eight contacts&mdash;to give a name, to give a company. It will end up demoralising the unemployed and being a pain in the neck for those who are being canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a government that is suggesting that, especially for small business, they want to reduce red tape and small business involvement in compliance with a number of government measures, this step is contrary to those notions. There will be costs to a number of people just for getting the contacts and just to have them in the diary. The youth worker from my electorate says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Structural unemployment occurs because our present standard of living requires a pool of permanently unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that some people might dismiss that as being a notion put up on an ideological basis. The perception of the people that youth workers and social workers are working with daily is that we have an economy that has an underlying pool of unemployed people who have to be churned through the system. This government has a lack of decisive leadership. It should say, `As <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a government this is what we aim to do with employment; this is a target that we have set; this is a target that we will endeavour to achieve.' Those who are unemployed continue to live in despair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that members of the government say that there is nothing magical in setting a target: they may not be able to achieve the target; it is an artificial level to aim for. The important thing is that much of what drives economies and employment creation is on the basis of perception and confidence. The remarks that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) made in the US about the markets illustrates the sensitivity. When the Australian Treasurer, after talking to the head of the American Reserve Bank, comes out and makes a statement, bleeps go everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When former Prime Minister Keating was Treasurer, an AAP wire statement said that he was about to resign as Treasurer. I forget now which way the bleep went&mdash;it went either up or down. Minister Reith will probably remember that it had a very positive effect. The point was that it illustrated that those people who sat behind the VDUs in different agencies, who made decisions about whether things were to be bought and sold in markets, often did it without really looking at what was actually happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the people at that end of the economy make decisions in that way, we can understand that unemployed people&mdash;who in the overwhelming majority legitimately want to achieve paid employment and who are getting a better understanding that paid employment may not necessarily be full&hyphen;time employment, that it can be casual or part&hyphen;time&mdash;will have greater confidence if there is a degree of leadership shown that we are not seeing at the moment. A degree of leadership will talk up the confidence not only for the employed but also for potential employers so that employment can be created: to get on with the job. Then there will be less need for people to conjure up this atmosphere that the predominant numbers of people on social security are there fraudulently.  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people know of those who are on the social security benefit who do not deserve it, I have no qualms in saying that they should <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5353"> take action to inform the proper authorities. On any occasion that this is put to me, that is simply what I say. If they know of a case, they should do the proper reporting, because it can be dealt with under measures that have already been put in place. The stricter compliance measures contained in this budget and this legislation are not required. Proper levels of compliance can be achieved without beating up what, as I have described, is the myth of overwhelming dole cheats. I will be supporting the range of amendments that the opposition will be putting forward later on in the consideration of this legislation in an attempt to try to improve this bill and its intent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence I will slightly correct an answer I gave earlier today in question time. In question time today, in answer to a question from the Leader of the Opposition about the publication of the guidelines of ministerial conduct under the former government, I made the claim that none of those guidelines had been published.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 before this House today contains many of the initiatives which we, the coalition, promised in the run-up to the 1996 federal election. There are a number of measures contained in this bill and with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to concentrate on a couple of those measures which I feel particularly strongly about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 1 and schedule 2 aim to increase the flexibility of the carer pension and to change references in certain acts from carer pension to carer payment, important commitments this government made to carers as part of the 1996 election strategy. Changing the name from carer pension to carer payment will not only go some way toward making the life of carers that little bit easier but it also <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5354"> acknowledges the valuable roles carers undertake in our society today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before becoming the people's representative in this House, I worked in what is today called the caring industry. Caring for another person or loved one who is terminally ill, disabled, diagnosed as having Alzheimers or just simply frail and growing old is not easy. On the contrary, it is mentally demanding and physically exhaustive to the point where carers often need to take time out for themselves to replenish their energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can give countless examples of carers who prior to the election would come to me frustrated at the severe restrictions placed on them by the previous government, which left little room for flexibility in terms of hours and days carers could leave their caring duties without having their pension affected. Next week is national carers week. I am glad that carers are recognised in such a way. I also acknowledge this government's recognition of the valuable role carers act out in their communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday I had the pleasure of attending a graduation ceremony for students of a NIES course at the Maddington Business Enterprise Centre in my electorate. One of the recipients was a young lady by the name of Monica McGhie, who intends to open an art gallery. There is nothing unusual about a young lady wishing to commence such a business, except that Monica has no arms and no legs. Whilst she is a great go&hyphen;getter, she is dependent on a carer 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Monica had previously been a resident in Rocky Bay Village, an excellent institution in Western Australia which caters for people with disabilities, but she now lives on her own in her own home with the help of carers. Monica is a person of very independent spirit and she can obviously achieve her goals, with the help of a carer, on her own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, I put it to you, is working very hard to help carers such as the person who provides care to Monica. We propose to extend from 10 to 20 the number of hours per week a carer may spend in employment, voluntary work, education or training without it affecting their qualification for carer payment. Similarly, we will increase from 42 to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 52 the number of days the carer may temporarily interrupt caring in any given calendar year without affecting their qualification for carer payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some might argue that those measures are not enough nor soon enough, but I put it to you that these measures show the determination of the government to be responsive to carers' needs. They demonstrate the sincerity of our aim to make the social security system more flexible when assessing carers' needs. They allow the carer more opportunity to participate in activities other than those of caring without having to worry about potential negative effects on their carer payment, a measure which is extremely important to the physical and mental well-being of those carers. Because this government understands that all carers need to recharge themselves, the measures I have referred to are complemented by an additional $36.2 million funding to expand the provision of respite care centres as well as care resource centres throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three measures I have mentioned will become effective on 1 July 1997. However, the coalition government recognises that there is still a lot of work that has to be done in the area affecting carers and will therefore review carers' income support arrangements before the end of this year. Our focus indeed will be on the adequacy of the existing provisions and how best we can improve the targeting of these payment structures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5355"> This government, in schedule 3 of this bill, is also making changes relating to sickness benefits, newstart and youth training allowances. Under the present system, the administration of some of the rules for sickness allowance and exemption from the newstart activity test is often cumbersome for both staff and those people dealing with the Department of Social Security services. The changes we in the coalition are therefore proposing aim to simplify and improve this process. We will introduce a 14-day grace period to allow a person to renew their qualification for the sickness allowance through providing the necessary medical certificate after the previous medical certificate has expired. This rule will equally apply to the activity test exemp tions for newstart and the youth training allowance and in so doing will assist sick and incapacitated people to claim payments from the Department of Social Security by allowing them this grace period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the present time, these people who are still incapacitated but only a day or more late in lodging a new medical certificate have to go through the whole process again. This is both inconvenient for the person making the claim and a waste of time for departmental staff, who have to spend unnecessary efforts going over all the same ground again&mdash;a measure, I would suggest, that is not extremely efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is also removing the loss of income qualification rules for sickness, newstart and the youth training allowance, ensuring that all those people who are sick or temporarily incapacitated for work are treated in the same fair manner. This measure will guarantee that the sole criterion for these allowances is a continuing temporary incapacity for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Presently, people seeking to gain these allowances have to be able to demonstrate that they have lost income. It is the low income earners and those people who are self-employed who lose out under the present arrangements as they get less than the maximum rate, even though they have no other income. It needs to be pointed out that presently those on newstart and the youth training allowance are not subject to this rule. As a result of this, those people on the sickness allowances are at a disadvantage, so I am pleased that these proposed measures will rectify the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 2 of schedule 5 tightens the definition of `unsuitable paid work' for those seeking work. This legislation also tightens activity test breach provisions relating to unemployment that is voluntary and the refusal of job offers. It will reclassify certain breaches as activity test breaches and extend the non-payment period for moving to an area of lower employment prospects from 12 weeks to 26 weeks. As well it clarifies the operation of the employer contract certificate provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is stopping the rorts in the social security system that were allowed by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Labor Party during their 13 years in office. The honest Australian public&mdash;those who pay their taxes and those who genuinely want to work and are actively seeking employment&mdash;would expect no less from this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition made a very significant commitment to tighten the activity test for unemployment payments. Australians are compassionate people and fully support unemployment benefits to those people who are genuinely unemployed and actively looking for a job. However, I can tell you from personal experience that Australians are also very concerned that, in many cases, benefits continue to be received by people who appear to make little effort to re-enter the job market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three additional actions contained in this legislation will attract an activity test deferment. They are: firstly, the failure to attend an interview for a job; secondly, the failure to complete a labour market program, being dismissed from a program before it has been completed, or proven misconduct; and, thirdly, the non&hyphen;declaration of earnings. I mention these additional changes to reflect how seriously the government takes these breaches of trust. They will also, no doubt, provide a much stronger deterrent against people rorting the system. I am sure the Australian public will applaud these measures by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of this legislation, schedule 6, which is of particular interest to me, is the initiative that puts the onus on unions and individuals to bear the financial responsibility for industrial action rather than the social welfare system and of course the Australian taxpayer. At the moment, current provisions allow workers and their unions some certainty in taking industrial action by allowing an income security floor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government intends to tighten the industrial action provisions to ensure that where a person is unemployed as a result of industrial action that person will remain disqualified for payments for six weeks after the industrial action has ceased. This measure will not affect a great number of people as most people who cease industrial action do <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5356"> return to their workplace rather than turn to the social security system. I am quite positive that the unions will not approve of this measure. However, middle Australia who still remember Bill Kelty's threats of industrial war during the election campaign and indeed the recent union led riots at the front of this building will heartily support the government on this move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to briefly comment on schedule 12 of this bill, which deals with amendments relating to widows and partners. The government reviewed provisions for assistance to widows and partners in this year's budget. This was in response to the need to develop a more rational integrated social security system and to simplify the payment structure. We also acknowledge that a need exists to improve and streamline the service clients most rightly expect to receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition indicated during the election campaign that it would lower the age requirement for widow allowance. This legislation does this in such a way that should not discourage younger widows from participating in the labour force. The package for widows in this bill provides for common payment conditions for older women who have no recent work force experience and ensures common payment arrangements when women reach the age pension age. The measures importantly recognise that both widow and partner allowances assist those older women who are, or have been in the past, dependent partners and because of their limited workplace experience are disadvantaged in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments, which commence on 20 January 1997, will extend the qualification for the widow allowance to women who are at least 50 years of age and who were widowed, divorced or separated after turning 40 years of age. It will also extend the qualification for partner allowance to Austudy, Abstudy and student financial supplement scheme partners. This will give those on the partner allowance access to the JET program and will standardise the recent work force experience requirements for partner allowance, to be consistent with the widow allowance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that numerous measurements are contained in this bill, and I have mentioned only several of them. However, there are some very broad themes that feature in this legislation, all of which point to this government being a government that believes in the safety net and that keeps its commitments to the poor and the needy. People who are in genuine need will continue to receive their current benefits. On the other end of the scale, however, those people who have significant assets and income will be required to use up those resources first before relying on the social security system, a system, after all, which is only there to help for the time that you are actually in need. This all ties in with our strong but fair budget which was announced earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, it is unacceptable for those people who are rorting the system to get away with it. But this should not imply that huge numbers of Australians are taking advantage of the social security system. The majority of Australians are honest and genuine in seeking work. As a government with a responsibility to the taxpayers and those who through no fault of their own&mdash;I stress that&mdash;are dependent on social security payments, it is up to us to ensure that only those who are entitled to these benefits receive them for the duration of their need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is simplifying the current complex system inherited from the Labor Party, which is inconsistent, cumbersome and, at times, unworkable. I am pleased to be able to speak on this legislation tonight. I do look forward to its passage in this place and its implementation next year.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak in this all&hyphen;important debate. Obviously in my contribution to the debate, I will focus on the provisions of the bill which affect Australia's unemployment. Before going to that, I want to take up some of the issues raised by the previous speaker&mdash;the honourable member for Canning (Mrs Johnston).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to perhaps the most comprehensive review of the Australian social security system that has ever occurred in the history <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5357"> of this nation. The commencement point for that review was the then Minister for Social Security, one Brian Howe. I am pleased to say that, prior to going to the ACTU in 1990, I was given the opportunity to serve on that social security review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tell you what, the social security system was in need of review. It was unfocused and non&hyphen;means tested, and it basically adopted the unemployment system of relief in this country that was aligned to passive assistance rather than embracing what had emerged internationally, which was about putting in place an active labour market program of activity. That was really the nature of the social security system that the Hawke and Keating Labor governments inherited in 1983. It was a system in disarray, a system, in essence, that was in some ways open to fraud and manipulation by those in the community who desired to take from it rather than face up to their responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take a few of the issues that were examined, reviewed and improved as a result of that social security review process. If anything, perhaps the system is a little bit cumbersome and a bit bureaucratic for this day and age. I will tell you why it is. We put in measures through the review process aimed at ensuring that the assistance we give as a nation goes to those in need and is not rorted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give you an example. In 1983, when the Hawke government came to power, a system known as `child endowment', which was changed in the years leading up to the loss of government by Malcolm Fraser to be called `family allowances', had been in operation. It is strange that you talk about giving assistance to those in need, avoiding fraud and making sure that those in the community who do not need assistance do not exploit the system. But in 1983 family payments were non&hyphen;means tested. So the most wealthy in the Australian community were able to put out their hand and claim family allowances whilst the needy in the community were denied assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that we means tested the system of family allowances. I will tell you why we did. It was so as to put in place a dual system, one that gave family payments <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to those who in the community, it could be argued, were entitled to a fair level of assistance. More importantly, it was to bring in a new system of additional family payments, means tested and targeted even more tightly, to give additional assistance to families in exceptionally needy circumstances. So we threw away the open system that was rorted under the previous government prior to 1983 to put in place, through the social security process, a system that means tested family payments and gave more assistance to families out there in dire financial circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go to the issue of unemployment relief. The Australian system was really put in place in 1945. But for all those years up to about 1987, there was basically a passive system of unemployment relief. Historically in Australia, we regarded unemployment as, in essence, something that confronts people from time to time but an issue that would be of a short&hyphen;term nature. Therefore, the system basically said that when you need some financial assistance, you will be paid what was regarded as an appropriate level of assistance. But there would be no requirement as unemployment worsened&mdash;as it did, both in the period immediately prior to the election in 1983 and during the late 1980s&mdash;to basically front up to your responsibilities and develop some targeted labour market programs that accepted that, within the labour market, there are different groups that require different levels of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We basically said that the old system of putting your hand out without any responsibility that was basically supported and developed by the likes of the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he was the Treasurer prior to 1983 was no longer acceptable. We went from a passive system of unemployment relief to one that was, in essence, based on an active labour market program. It correctly gave assistance to people who lost their jobs and needed financial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our system also said that within the labour market there are particular groups who have different needs. One was, for example, widowed women. Historically, prior to about 1987 they had been entitled to the class B <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5358"> widows pension. We adopted the view that we should no longer tolerate a situation by which the Australian community said to those widows, `We really don't want you to undergo a labour market program aimed at getting you back to work and developing a second opportunity in life.' We said to those women, `We reject the previous system that existed prior to 1983. We are prepared to support you when you need support to bring up your children because of the exceptionally difficult circumstances that confront sole parents, but at a particular point in life and at a time at which your children should start to stand on their own feet, you are also obligated to face up to your responsibilities and to try to get back into the Australian work force.' We did not say it was their responsibility alone. We said it was also a government responsibility to assist them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We brought in a new program called JET&mdash;jobs, education and training. We went out of our way to give those people, a particular segment of the Australian labour movement, a terrific opportunity in life to undertake training and to get back into meaningful work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then accepted that there was an emerging problem with respect to the long-term unemployed. Having examined the situation, we developed yet another program. We did not like the old system of passive payment of unemployment relief that was very much part and parcel of the system that previously existed when the current Prime Minister was the Treasurer. We brought in newstart, a specific program aimed at giving the long-term unemployed a second opportunity to get back to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to those issues this evening because I take exception to suggestions in this House with respect to the debate around this bill that the current system of social security relief in this country is open to rorting and fraud. More than ever over the last decade this parliament has approved measures aimed at making sure we go out of our way to avoid the opportunities for rorting and fraud that existed in the Australian social security system prior to 1983.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having raised those issues, I want to go to the issue of unemployment at the moment. So far as I am concerned, the response by the current government is pathetic. It is about time they accepted that it is the most important issue confronting the nation at the moment. That is not just my view; it is also the view of the economic think&hyphen;tank that has historically given advice to the coalition. I refer to Access Economics. Despite having factored in the view of the Prime Minister that it is all going to be rosy when the budget strategy is put in place and when the changes to industrial relations are put in place, last week Access Economics suggested&mdash;the report is there; I know the government was not willing to have the report tabled in parliament last week&mdash;that by 2001, at best, unemployment in Australia is still going to be over nine per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that there is an urgency about the issue of unemployment. I suggest that there is a responsibility on all of us to go out of our way not to punish the people who are currently unemployed but to create opportunities to get them back to work through appropriately targeted systems of labour market assistance and by ensuring that we exercise a little bit of compassion rather than incorrectly pointing the finger at those who are going through a very difficult period in their lives. It is about offering them the carrot of better training and job preparation through labour market programs, as the Labor Party did through the previous review of the social security system in this country and through the development of Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have any doubts about pointing the finger and suggesting that the unemployed people are to blame at the moment, just consider some of the miserable measures embodied in legislation currently before the House for debate. There is not a huge payment, but a payment that was very much valued by the unemployed, paid through the Australian social security system to assist the unemployed in getting back to work. I refer to the $100&mdash;yes, $100&mdash;employment entry payment to the jobless. It pales into insignificance when you consider the earnings over the last six months of the investments of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5359"> former Assistant Treasurer. On a $50,000 investment that was so small he could not even think about it, I think the return was in the order of $9,000. But he could not remember that $50,000 investment. He was part of a budget process that has now, if this legislation is passed, resulted in people who need assistance losing a miserable and modest incentive payment of $100 aimed at assisting the unemployed in getting back to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attitude of this government&mdash;the Howard government&mdash;to the unemployed is to hound them for being out of work, despite the fact that the government used to stand on this side of the House and make speeches about the need for structural adjustment and the need to improve efficiencies in the waterfront industry, the railway industry, the manufacturing industry and the automotive industry. Yes, they like to make those speeches, but they are not prepared to accept responsibility for the fact that some of those hard decisions that we had to make over the last decade for a record period of inactivity with respect to facing up to our economic responsibilities prior to 1983 rested at the feet of successive coalition governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what it is about. In the period of 10 to 13 years we had to make decisions that should have been made over previous decades with respect to positioning Australia to compete in the global economy. But, unfortunately, the end result of some of those decisions has been that many people were displaced from a variety of industries: for example, from the railway industry in all states of Australia and at a national level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The waterfront industry resolved that we had to rejuvenate the work force and bring in a younger, better trained work force, so a lot of waterfront workers lost their jobs. In the manufacturing industry, we decided that the automotive industry had to be able to compete, so a lot of automotive workers lost their jobs. For example, the Nissan factory in Melbourne, in an area of high unemployment, closed down with the loss of thousands of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the nation correctly resolved and has supported a proposal which was aimed at ensuring that we went out of our way as a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nation to look after those people who lost their jobs and their families and aimed at ensuring that we continued to review and improve our social security system and our labour market program system of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That proposal said, yes, our labour market program system of assistance is integrated and, yes, there is a reciprocal obligation. That is what it was about&mdash;a reciprocal obligation by which if you are paid unemployment assistance you had to front up to your responsibilities. You had to meet certain tests to ensure that the system was not subject to fraud and rorting. Independent reports clearly establish that the Australian social security system is one of the best in the world. That, therefore, means that there are bureaucratic requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the real intent of the current government. Having established the so-called agency that is part and parcel of the suggestions before the House at the moment and in the budget papers, they want to go one step further and privatise that agency if they win a second term of government. Basically, they are going to hand over to the private sector&mdash;it might be to the Challenge Bank; it might even be Drake, and it is interesting to see that the Drake employment agency is a previous donor to the coalition&mdash;responsibility in the future for the payment of benefits with the consequent loss of thousands and thousands of further government jobs. That is what we are really talking about&mdash;even higher unemployment related to the type of social security legislation that is before the House for debate this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe, as the current government does, that we ought to treat the unemployed as petty criminals. I tell you who the real criminals are: the real criminals sit on the other side of the House at the moment. They are the people who used to argue for changes in the structure of Australian industry, they are the people who like to talk about efficiency at work, but they are the people who now want to take away from the unemployed assistance which is their entitlement because they have paid their taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the textile, clothing and footwear industries, for example. Many of the women, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5360"> who are of a non-English speaking background, are expected to work in that industry for the rest of their lives. But we all resolved that the textile, clothing and footwear industry had to become more competitive. We could not compete, for example, with China for the manufacture of T-shirts or thongs, so thousands and thousands of textile, clothing and footwear workers lost their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now this government says that, in essence, they are dole bludgers and that it will bring in special systems piloted in Tasmania aimed at dobbing in a dole bludger. Let us consider the cost of the dob&hyphen;in&hyphen;a&hyphen;dole&hyphen;bludger operation and its success. There were 3,387 phone calls received. How many of these were to dob in a so-called dole bludger&mdash;the criminals in the minds of the current government? Surprise, surprise!  Thirty. That is right&mdash;30. Probably even more members than Senator Newman has got in the local Liberal Party branch in northern Tasmania. That is the degree of success that Senator Newman, the Minister for Social Security, achieved through dob&hyphen;in&hyphen;a&hyphen;dole&hyphen;bludger&mdash;less than one per cent of all the phone calls. And at what cost? We are worried about costs. I tell you what: if there was ever a waste of money, it was the so-called dob&hyphen;in&hyphen;a&hyphen;dole&hyphen;bludger system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a person who had an opportunity to serve on the social security review process prior to 1990, I am exceptionally proud of the Australian social security system. It is targeted. It gives assistance to those in the Australian community who need assistance. All those people who are unemployed are not unemployed in this day and age because they want to be unemployed; they are unemployed in this day and age because the Australian community&mdash;this parliament&mdash;made tough decisions. It also means that we as a nation have a reciprocal obligation. In the same way in which they have a reciprocal obligation for the payment of their benefits to front up to their responsibilities, we have a reciprocal obligation to ensure that the system of social security that exists in Australia is fair, is targeted and gives assistance to those in need in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main amendments in this bill are aimed at punishing the unemployed. It is wrong to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suggest that they are criminals. We as a nation should exercise on an ongoing basis compassion and give assistance rather than trying to develop political hype for short&hyphen;term political gain based on coalition election polling which suggests that there are votes in belting the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this bill is about. It is about the coalition's political polling which suggests that there are votes in giving the unemployed and those in need in the Australian community a belt around the ear. I tell you what: the government is wrong. If it keeps it up, it will be responsible for creating social ghettos in this country because of its decisions to reduce and remove assistance where assistance is needed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are discussing the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 and I think this bill, more than any other, really sends to the Australian community the coalition's message from the budget. The message is: don't get old; don't have a disability; don't have a child with a disability; if you are unemployed, that's bad luck; and, if you are a young person who is unemployed, you really get hit with a double whammy. This piece of legislation is an attack on the more vulnerable in our community and, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), said, it is directly driven by the coalition's feeling that they want to get even with the unemployed. I think that is a really disgraceful attitude for the government to take.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government spent a lot of time during the election campaign and beforehand beating up the idea that there are all those people out there on unemployment benefits who are ripping off the system. I do not think that was actually true. Indeed, the previous Labor government spent many years tightening up and targeting benefits so that in the 1990s you did not have the open slather that you had in the Fraser government years when the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer and presided over that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We spent a lot of time and effort trying to make the social security system fair and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5361"> targeted to those in need. What we wanted to do was put a safety net into the system so that people who were not able to get a job, or people who had disabilities or children and could not get employment, would receive some basic level of support from the government towards those costs. We thought that is what governments ought to be there for&mdash;that governments, in a civilised society, have an obligation on behalf of all of us to look after those people who, in many instances through no fault of their own, are not able to get an income. That is what most other enlightened governments around the world have tried to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we tried to do over the years was ensure that the money in the social security system, the tax dollars of all of us who were working at the time, were spent properly and in such a way that we took most, if not all, of the rorts out of the system. But because the coalition got this idea that somehow or other there were millions of dole bludgers or millions of people ripping off the system, when they came to government and found out that there weren't, they just decided to cancel a lot of these programs. That is an iniquitous thing to do because a lot of the programs that this bill will take away when it is passed by this House&mdash;hopefully, it will not be passed by the Senate, but it probably will&mdash;are a lot of the smaller benefits that we provided as a government to help people back to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a myth around that, because there are eight per cent unemployed, the government are going to increase unemployment, because this budget is predicated on unemployment going up, not down. I do not think there has been a government in the last 30 years that has brought down a budget and was bold enough to say, `This budget is about unemployment going up.' So even in the government's own budget papers they believe that unemployment will increase. But at the same time they are saying, `And we will make life even more difficult for people who are on unemployment.' It is a myth that there is a whole army of people out there who want to live on unemployment benefits. There just isn't. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming majority of the unemployed want to get a job. They do not want to be on unemployment benefits. They want to get a job. When we were in government we had a number of payments that we made to people to help them get a job, but this bill abolishes a number of those payments. We have the abolition of the employment entry payment and a modification of the education entry payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both these programs were to help young people in particular either get a job or get into an education program. Abolition of the employment entry payment is just a way of trying to make it harder for people to get work. When you are going out for a job nowadays, it costs you money. You have to get a uniform sometimes, so there is often the cost of that uniform for an employee. If you want to get a job as a forklift truck driver, you have to pay the cost of work shoes. If you are a nurse and you want to work in a private hospital or a nursing home where they do not provide you with uniforms as they do in the public hospital system, there is the cost of uniforms, the cost of shoes, and even little things like hair ties, because there is an occupational health and safety regulation, if you are a nurse, to have your hair tied back if your hair goes below your collar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are costs of getting a job. If a person had no money and was out of work, we as a government said, `We will provide you with a small allowance to take that barrier away.' Often, it is little barriers like that which stop people getting into the work force. But the government is going to abolish that now and make it harder for people to get work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the cost of child care. What the government has done is abolish the operational subsidies for long day care centres, which will see that the cost to a person starting a job, if they need child care, will go up to about $25 a week for a child under three and about $14 a week extra for a child over three. And this is an entry cost for someone getting a job. If we want to help, if we want people to get work, we should be doing our best to help them into that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the cost of transport to get to the job in the week before you get paid. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5362"> employment entry payment helped people do those things. If you are just about to get a job and you have not had a job for a while, that is when money is most needed to start the new job. The payment was put in place to remove those barriers to employment and education for social security recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It just seems to me to go against the government's own rhetoric when the government says that it wants to get people off the unemployment rolls but it is going to ensure that people do not get that little bit of extra assistance that might help them to get work. It is as if we have to somehow or other punish these people for being unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of the education entry repayment also seeks to single out the most vulnerable. It is difficult enough these days to try to obtain an education, without not having the right materials to do so. The $200 education entry payment helped people to buy books and the various materials that you often needed&mdash;stationery, equipment and supplies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just wrong and mean-spirited of the government to attack people who want to get themselves into education or want to get themselves into employment. These two programs gave people a little bit of extra help. They gave them help when they were trying to get themselves out of unemployment and into work or education. I think it is terribly mean. As well as being mean, it is just plain downright stupid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also does some terrible things to people who have got children with a disability. There are not many families in Australia which are worse off than a family that, unfortunately, has a disabled child. But one of the measures in this legislation reduces the back payment for children with a disability to three months before the claim was made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government says it wants to do things for families. But it is not trying to do too much for families with disabilities when you see these sorts of draconian things done. It is interesting to compare what the government is doing here to a family with a disabled child with what it is doing to the so-called families under its family tax package, which passed this House last week.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that package a person on an income of $70,000 with a couple of kids got some extra money out of the tax system. The government said that was helping families. That was helping families who were fairly well off. If a person has an income of $70,000, you would have thought they would have been pretty much able to help themselves. I would have thought they would have. But here we find that, so the government can finance this tax give&hyphen;away to wealthy families&mdash;a family where the husband or the wife earns $70,000&mdash;it is taking money off disabled families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously the child disability allowance had a 12-month back payment in recognition of the length of time it took to diagnose a child with disabilities. We thought that was a fair payment to make to families because a family with a disabled child needs as much help as it can get. This government thinks it is pretty good to give money to a family that has a $70,000 income earner in it. I think that is giving to those who have got and what we are doing here is taking it away from those who need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my staffers has a brother who is intellectually handicapped. He is now 18, but his parents were pushed from pillar to post trying to find out what his disability was. He had a limited attention span, behavioural problems and poor speech. It took them years before a specialist finally worked out what his problem was. They had gone to doctors, psychologists, speech therapists and educational therapists. He had had medication and been to dietitians. The actual diagnosis of his problem was not made for a number of years until he had a CT scan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5363"> When we were in government we would have made a small back payment of 12-month's worth of the allowance to that family because that family had incurred huge costs in finding out what was wrong with their son. The government is not going to give them much at all. It is going to give a lot more money to someone with an income of $70,000 and a couple of kids. I just think that is mean. That is mean-spirited and it is helping those who need it less than the people the govern ment is attacking in this budget bill here tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government continues its attack on those who have not got much, we see that it is going to abolish the earnings credit scheme. I thought the earnings credit scheme was a very good initiative of the previous Labor government because it allowed people on jobsearch, sole parents or pensioners to earn up to $1,000 a year from some small job and let them average that over the year in the same way farmers and creative people are allowed to average some of their income over some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we said to those pensioners, whether they were on jobsearch, a sole parent or an aged pensioner, `Go out and find a little bit of work. The reason we would like you to take advantage of this scheme is that you might find a job that you want to do and you will move from being on a social security scheme into a real job.' We thought that was a pretty good scheme. We thought that was pretty fair. We thought that was a good way to encourage people legitimately on a sole parent pension or a widows pension who might want to go back to the work force. We thought that would encourage them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were not on our own in thinking that the earnings credit scheme was a good idea. The present coalition government thought it was a good idea, too. In fact, the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said in the run-up to the election campaign that they would not touch this scheme. They told pensioner groups all around Australia that they would not touch it. The government told pensioners they thought it was a good idea, but now we see a few months later they are attacking the unemployed and they are attacking pensioners as well. It was a lousy $1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my constituents rang me up a few weeks ago. She was a woman who was in her fifties and on a widows pension. She used to have a little job where she supervised university exams. That used to give her a little bit of extra money at Christmas time, because university exams are at that end of the year. She used to average it over the year, and it never affected her pension. But now, under this mean-spirited government, if she goes <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and gets that little job, at the end of the year she is going to lose her pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the reality is that she will not go and do that little job. What is going to happen is that she will have about $1,000 a year less. She used to use that money to do some things at Christmas time. So Santa Claus is going to call on her this year. Santa Claus Howard is going to say, `Well, unfortunately for you, you can't get that money anymore.' Even the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran), who is at the table, has been touched by this, and he is going over to ask his advisers, `Is it true?' The truth is that it is true. He is so stupid that he has not even found out about this&mdash;and he is in the ministry! He is like the rest of these people who put their hands up for this budget and tried to tell people that it was terrific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular little barb in here is a direct lie on the government's part to what they said to the Australian people. The Prime Minister told the Australian people that the government would not touch this scheme. Six months later, they have not touched it&mdash;they have abolished it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have also made a number of changes to the payments which will be made to people who are under the age of 18. They have directly attacked them and, in fact, what they have done is left the door open to reduce minimum payments for people up to 25 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party in government was committed to programs and services that provided access to employment for job seekers on an equitable basis. We tried to encourage a move away from passive income support. Indeed, we were criticised by some parts of the community for doing that, because we said, `We don't want to just pay out benefits like the lazy old Fraser-Howard government did <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5364"> in the past.' We said, `What we want to do is target money that the government has to those who are most in need.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provisions were made to assist pensioners into employment with financial assistance. The earnings credit scheme was one of the major ways of doing that, but the government has now canned that. What the government will find is that people will not take up employment opportunities. I suppose the next thing they will do to pensioners after that is try to find some way to cut their pensions and starve them back into the work force for jobs that will not be there. Their own budget estimates show that unemployment is going to get bigger rather than smaller in the first 12 months of this government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 is a fairly substantial bill and it has a large number of changes in it. One of the things that I really am very impressed with is the change to those provisions that relate to the opportunity for unemployed people to do voluntary work. Until recently the activity test prevented people from being able to undertake voluntary work when they were unemployed. Effectively, people who otherwise would have been able to quite successfully engage in constructive and positive work on behalf of the community were prevented from doing so by being forced, essentially, to stop work. In other words, they were prevented from being able to work voluntarily. Of course, in many instances, they were prevented from being able to maintain their job skills and their work discipline and ethic by using their skills to benefit the community, particularly voluntary organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just touch on a few other aspects. First of all, I would like to say that Australians have an innate sense of fairness and demand that a safety net exists for all those who are in need of assistance in this nation, but they also demand, however, that it be appropriate and that we do not develop a welfare industry in this country. That is why in this regard I support the general thrust of this bill. There are some aspects of it that I cannot support, and I call on the government to have a look at these aspects again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first instance there are some changes in relation to recovery provisions. The amendments concerned seek to provide for recovery of social security payments that have been paid to persons in excess of their correct entitlements but which are not currently recoverable as debts. This includes overpayments, automatic reductions, prepayments and reduction of benefits that are paid before the rate is reduced. To give an example of an overpayment, a person is being paid at a particular rate and circumstances change that would mean a reduction in the rate of payment. Notification of the change is not made and payment continues at the old rate. In <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some instances this overpayment may not currently be recoverable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give an example in relation to automatic reduction, payments are being made at the correct rate. An individual notifies the department of a change in circumstances where a rate reduction would result. Corrective action is not taken and overpayment results. Under current rules this may not be recoverable. I do not think that any reasonable person would accept that the department should incur debts on behalf of Australian taxpayers in either of these cases. Similarly, under the current arrangements the secretary may waive debt incurred to the Commonwealth under the act in a wide range of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the government's decision to more closely prescribe the discretion to waive debts, provided that capacity to repay is taken into account when calculating the instalment level of debt recovery. These debt recovery provisions are clearly very reasonable and important. Provided the rates of recovery are appropriate, anyone who has been overpaid such an entitlement should expect to be required to repay it. Surely the electorate would require this very basic minimum. In commending the government for making the attempt to redress the problem, I must ask why it was never addressed properly by the previous government. They may care to answer that. In fact, the member for Calwell might answer that when he makes his contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the industrial action provision, I am particularly pleased with the government's amendments relating to provisions of the Social Security Act and the Student and Youth Assistance Act. These changes will ensure that, where a person is unemployed as a result of industrial action, the person will remain disqualified for a period of six weeks after the industrial action has ceased. Although people are not eligible to receive newstart if that unemployment is due to industrial action, they are eligible for benefits after the relevant industrial action has stopped if they meet the criteria for newstart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I and the vast majority of people in this country do not believe that workers who become unemployed because of the pursuit of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5366"> an industrial relations objective should immediately receive support from taxpayer funded benefits without a qualifying period. There are many legitimately unemployed people who deserve that funding, having submitted themselves to a waiting period and having met activity test criteria. The six&hyphen;week provision, however, provides adequate protection for those who do become genuinely unemployed at the conclusion of an industrial action. I believe that this is a fair and equitable provision that brings more consistency to our social security system. I applaud the government for its action in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the revision of the activity test, I am very pleased that the government has fulfilled its election promise to tighten the activity test requirements for the unemployed. I support the government and the community view that only those who are genuinely unemployed and actively seeking to participate in the work force should receive payment. Although the activity test was introduced in 1991 with good intentions by the former government, for too long it has remained open to abuse by an unscrupulous number of people. It is commendable that the tightening of this test has been addressed so quickly in the term of this new government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the great majority of Australians in receipt of income support through unemployment benefits are people in genuine need who are involved in genuine job search. The current system of payments, however, does allow for rorting. The Australian community has indicated very clearly that this is not acceptable. It is deeply concerned that people should meet all their obligations when receiving taxpayer funded support because they are unemployed. They also expect taxpayer systems to be fair but properly and effectively managed. Tightening of the provisions of the bill will be welcomed by the great majority of people in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only fair that appropriate penalties are applied for noncompliance with the activity test. Within reason, these penalties should apply to refusal of a job offer and voluntary unemployment. Under the current system, failure to attend a job interview or voluntary cessation of a labour market program without <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adequate reason may not be, but should clearly be, a breach of the activity test. Deliberately providing false information that allows someone to increase the size of their benefit or to gain a benefit they may not otherwise be entitled to should be punished in any fair system. I commend the government's decision to apply such breaches of faith with our community as noncompliance with the activity test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My only area of concern here relates to the administration of the social security system following the changes under this amendment. They will be extensive and will require detailed explanation to the public. My experience with people in my electorate who have experienced problems with the department over unemployment is that there is a high level of dissatisfaction with the level of service provided, given the number of people that are available to provide the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that, at the principal office for the Department of Social Security in my electorate at Joondalup, the officers work assiduously to provide the service to the people who are in need of their assistance. In making the cutbacks to the programs that are necessary to bring back the budget deficit, I can only urge that in cases like this a clear examination is made of the level, quality and consistency of service available, particularly in the area of Joondalup in my electorate where there is such huge growth amongst young families raising children and where obviously there are going to be extraordinary and, let us say, disproportionate demands on social security services. I, therefore, call on the government to closely monitor the changes relating to the unemployed in the implementation of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to other compliance improvements. One of the great criticisms of our social security system that is often represented to me is that it is prone to rorting. This is not to say that people do not want to provide assistance to those who are less fortunate and may be unemployed, either temporarily or long term. Currently, people in this country want to provide an adequate safety net for the unemployed and disadvantaged, but they will not tolerate abuses of this safety net any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5367"> longer. It is a fundamental duty of this government to determine appropriate rules and then ensure compliance. Failure to do so will eventually see people in Australia en masse refusing to accept their societal obligations to provide social security support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what I was saying earlier in relation to the size of the cake. If people are getting slices of that cake which they are not entitled to, people who would have been entitled to it either do not get their slice or have a slice that is disproportionately smaller. That is unfair. It certainly does not reflect a compassionate society; it reflects a society that is not providing targeted assistance to those who need it. I commend this government on the improvements to compliance proposed by this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Attendance at a CES interview when requested to do so should be a clear and necessary requirement for people to maintain their full benefits. This is a basic and reasonable requirement. I do not think anybody in their right mind would disagree with that, except perhaps those who consider it to be too onerous and who really ought to be considering again their commitment to ensuring they are complying with the requirements. I cannot understand how the previous government could justify not requiring people to attend CES interviews when requested before they could receive their full rate of benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Failure to comply with notification requirements covers the need for people wishing to receive benefit to provide a range of information. Often this is necessary to determine whether they are entitled to a benefit or what level of benefit they should receive. Typical information should include any information relating to the payment of an allowance such as a partner's tax file number or any relevant changes in circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not onerous conditions being forced on the unemployed. Rather, they represent a community based call for fair and appropriate compliance measures to improve the equity of our social security system. I am satisfied that these measures are in the best interests of us all and I support the government in its intent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the government for its initiatives to fulfil its election promises to carers. The change of name from carer pension to carer payment is not only symbolic but also important. It establishes that this itself is a payment to the recipient for services rather than a payment for circumstances. It is part of a welcome change to the psychology of our social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment extends from 10 to 20 hours per week the time that carers may spend in employment, voluntary work, education or training without affecting their qualification for carer payment. Carers play an invaluable role in the community, and unless we are able to support them in their efforts we do them and those they care for a grave disservice. Further, as they represent such a large part of our home care system, the costs to the taxpayer attached to not making it as easy as possible for them to perform their role would be enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment increases from 42 to 52 days per calendar year that a carer may temporarily cease caring without affecting their entitlement to carer payment. The benefit will allow them to take necessary breaks from the stress of providing home care provision without disadvantage. The amendment will increase the ability of carers to maintain their education and training so as to keep up skills related to their employment while involved in caring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased with this approach taken to carers by the government. It recognises the very important service they provide and the real savings to the community these services represent. This element of the amendment could provide significant savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to one of the areas where I have a major concern, and this is in the arrangements where changes are made to deeming provisions for pensioners. The government states that changes in the deeming rules are a measure to simplify and reduce the intrusive nature of the taxation system. Independent commentators have stated that the effect of this change is that pensioners must ensure that their money must achieve a return of at least five per cent to avoid being disadvantaged.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5368">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have stated that I am opposed utterly to any measures taken by the government that will disadvantage pensioners and in particular age pensioners. In this instance, this represents to me a breach of some of the undertakings made prior to or during the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the difficulty in gaining a five per cent return after operating costs in the working accounts that the original exemption was designed to provide for, I continue to oppose this measure. I call on the government to reverse its decision on the extension of the deeming rules for pensioners and reinstate the previous exemption of the first $2,000 for singles and $4,000 for couples from the deeming provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the government for its approach taken in the majority of this bill. I support its stance particularly on the recovery provisions, the industrial action provisions, the revision of the activity test, the improvements of compliance measures and the approach to carers. But, as I said earlier, I cannot support the government's extension of the deeming provisions. I sincerely call on the coalition to review and reverse its decision on the extension of the deeming rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From looking at the budget papers, from looking at some of the commentary associated with it, I very much doubt whether in fact this particular provision is going to bring forward the savings the government envisaged. I know from speaking to seniors representatives in my electorate that already the provision or the changes are causing grave disquiet. We all know that one of the most unsettling facets of modern life for senior citizens is the constant change to the law and to regulations that obviously affect their opportunity of being able to provide themselves with an income or to make the appropriate arrangements for their retirement lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are a country that prides itself on being compassionate. In particular, we recognise and reward the contribution made by our aged community not only to the development of the community but also to raising the families that now in many cases are the productive working families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me to be very unfortunate that, in making changes, we have created a whole <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> new plethora of paper work, considerations and worry for seniors. It is one of those things that is inevitable when making reforms and it is something that a reformist government has to take into account. At times trying with the best of intentions to change the law in order to provide for a system that perhaps appears on the surface to be fairer, we are in fact creating a monster that is going to terrify people who, at the very best of times, find it hard to understand the range of requirements, red tape, et cetera in order to qualify for their pension payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government introduced the deeming provisions on managed investments and share portfolios. I thought that was one of the most unfair and inequitable changes ever made by a government&mdash;that you could actually have a notional earning or capital gain on an investment that may never be recoverable, but that notional gain is used for the purposes of determining the eligibility of an aged person for an age pension. My conversations with and of course representations from individuals and groups at the time these changes were made give rise to this concern that I have about the changes relating to the deeming provisions on the first $2,000 or $4,000 of a single pensioner's or pensioner couple's liquid assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask those responsible for putting these provisions forward to go out into the real world and have a look at just how easy it is to earn an income of that sort with those sorts of moneys. You will find that it is extraordinarily difficult. You will find that, for somebody who is a pensioner, at the best of times worried about their money and worried about their future, this represents an extraordinarily terrifying prospect. I can only urge the government to think again about this. Other than that, I support the provisions of this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Moore (Mr Filing) made some comments at the beginning of this debate about me and about where he stands in the context of the general economic situation. The member for Moore calls himself an Independent but in fact every time he becomes a total and utter apologist for the Liberal Party and the positions which they put <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5369"> forward. The only criticism that he made on the deeming provisions was one that I had some sympathy with. The whole of his speech was nothing more than an apology for the government's dreadful actions in relation to this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will point out why we are at this point. We have introduced these new, tough measures in relation to the unemployed, pensioners and other beneficiaries. Why have we done this? We have done this because the government can see&mdash;and it is in their own papers&mdash;that they have no way of dealing with the unemployment crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the member for Moore is listening to this. He talked about growth. He said that some people, like myself, are opposed to growth. The fact that he has not read anything that I have written on the economy for the last 15 years is another matter. Are we to assume that he is actually saying that the government is putting forward a proposal for growth? If that is what he is saying, then he had better read the budget papers because the budget papers clearly show that growth is going to go down, not up. Has the member for Moore heard that? Growth, according to the budget papers, is going to go down, not up. This is the wonderful government that you love to support, even though they do not want anything to do with you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental reality is that we have this situation where we had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promising the Australian people that he would offer a new vision, a new direction based on economic growth and prosperity. And what do we get? In the very first budget, instead of growth going up, the government itself predicted that it will go down. The government's predictions are wrong. Growth will be lower than the government is predicting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already those people whom I talk to in business&mdash;and the member for Moore might be a bit surprised that I talk to a lot of people in business&mdash;tell me how soft the economy is at the moment, how soft demand is at the moment and how soft the employment situation is at the moment. They are telling me that not only will growth be going down as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> predicted by the government, but also, most likely, it is going to go even further down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of this, what do we have? The hardheads who put forward this budget know that there are going to be serious problems of unemployment, they know that there are going to be serious problems of hardship, so of course they do not want a massive blow&hyphen;out in the payments for social security and unemployment benefits. So what do they do? They bring in a mean&hyphen;spirited regime, together with a budget, in order to punish the victim and to make the unemployed suffer the consequences of the shambles which constitute economic policy from the government. I say `shambles' because of this: if you have heard the Prime Minister, over and over it is the same record, the same song, that he is giving us&mdash;unemployment will go down because industrial relations reforms are going to be carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no other solution, no industry policy and no sensible economic policy. There is only one thing: the idea that, if you get certain industrial relations laws through, laws which are designed to cut the wages and reduce the conditions of workers, somehow that is going to magically fix up the economy, increase employment and everything will be hunky&hyphen;dory. The member for Moore mentioned this issue as well. Anybody who has studied this approach in other countries can tell you that those countries who have relied solely on such industrial relations reforms to change the employment situation have done very badly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have some nations with high levels of growth and reasonably good wages and conditions and we have other countries with low wage levels and bad growth records, because it is not just a question of industrial relations or the wage levels. It is a question of planning a sensible industry policy. It is a question of taking advantage of technology. It is a question of making sure that you have incentives in place to attract business investment and get employment going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A parliamentary delegation of which I was a member has just returned from Ireland and the European Union. The members of that delegation were interested to find that Ireland <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5370"> has converted its economy from 75 per cent agricultural dependence to 75 per cent dependence on manufacturing and computer industries&mdash;within 15 years! How did it manage to do that? It did that by having specific industry policies, specific incentives for business and specific incentives directed towards employment. That is what Ireland had. Companies were asked to come in and employ a certain number of people. In return for that, they were given concessions. In that way they got industry going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do we have an industry policy from the government? We have not even heard of an industry policy. All we hear from the Prime Minister over and over again is the same old industrial relations nonsense. He has no idea on how to get this country going. He has no idea on how to get the economy of this country going. The only thing we are told is, `Cut wages and conditions, and everything will be all right.' What a nonsense and what a disastrous strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just make one simple economic point. If people's wages and conditions are cut and their situations of employment become more precarious, what will they do? Will they spend a lot of money? Of course not. Whatever moneys they have they will save, to a certain degree, to try to protect themselves. They certainly will not go out on a spending spree. If you do not spend, you do not have demand in the economy; and if you do not have demand in the economy, where are most of your small businesses going to go? This is simple economic theory. This is not socialist theory; this is capitalistic economy theory, if you like, or free enterprise economic theory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the honourable member who provoked me into making some preliminary comments about why we have these measures in place, why the government has brought them forward, let me say that it is because the government does not have these answers and because it knows that unemployment is going to go up. That is the reason for the government coming out with this solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, let me say that this solution is the kind of solution we would have expected from right wing Thatcherite theory. It is the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> right wing Thatcher theory which we were promised had been dumped by the Liberal Party. After all, they dumped Dr Hewson. They said that they would not do these things. They said that they would not impose such cuts on social security, unemployment concessions, and the like. They said that they would not proceed with Fightback, which had all these measures in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, what do we find? Very soon after getting into government, they invent this idea that there is some kind of crisis in terms of the budget&mdash;which there is not. The problem with the economy is not the federal budget; the problem with the economy is lack of demand and lack of planning. But, leaving that aside, what do they do? They come in here and say to us, `What we have to do is get really tough with the unemployed; we have to put in these measures'&mdash;these mean&hyphen;spirited measures&mdash;`we have to make sure that we err on the side of punishing the guilty, and never mind the fact that in that process we might also punish some innocent people'&mdash;a lot of innocent people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In determining measures to deal with unemployment and unemployment benefits, of course one has to take account of the fact that some people believe that they can rip off the system. But they are only a minority. In order to get at that minority, what do we have put into place? We have put into place in this legislation measures which will, in fact, punish the majority of people who are unemployed through no fault of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of these measures are ridiculous. They allow an officer in the Department of Social Security to make a subjective judgment about whether or not somebody has made enough of an effort to find employment. You might say, `Fair enough, produce some evidence.' But the production of some evidence is not enough. Under these measures absurdly tough requirements will be required of people&mdash;absurdly tough requirements.</PARA>

In fact, you probably belong there and that is your problem. I go back to the question of breach of promises. Let me read something here. This states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People who are unemployed should be given every incentive to work. If a person is not able to find full time work, he or she may be able to obtain part time work. Part time work will supplement the person's income, provide employment skills and assist the transition back into the full time work force. The earnings credit scheme will be retained by a Coalition Government.</PARA>
<PARA>This scheme was designed to ensure that people could work for some time&mdash;I refer to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5372"> people on pensions and benefits&mdash;and not lose their pension or benefit. People could go over the limit, provided it was for a short period. In other words, the earnings you made in this short period could be spread over the whole year. People could thereby save themselves being cut off from that particular pension or benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very sensible scheme, one that encouraged people to work while they were also earning something on a pension or benefit without exceeding the total they were entitled to for the whole year. Very sensible. Very pragmatic. What happens to it? It is dumped. It is taken out in the budget. Never mind the promise made only a few months ago that the earnings credit scheme would be retained by a coalition government. This was a very sensible approach to encourage people to participate in the work force but also earn a pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give an example. A retired person may be required to do a special job for a couple of weeks. It gives them dignity and respect. They do a special job and earn a certain amount of money&mdash;not such that it is more than the total they are entitled to earn for the whole year. They earn it in that two-week period or three-week period or whatever it might be. Under the earnings credit scheme they would have retained their pension. What happens in this situation? Never mind the fact that the promise was there that it would be retained. It is dropped. It is an absurd idea coming from the Liberal-National parties. It is another one of these mean&hyphen;spirited actions that will have a dangerous effect on people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just one of the examples. I could go over all of these clauses again pointing out what is wrong with them, why they have been put into place and the hardships they are going to cause for unemployed people, pensioners and people with disabilities. A whole range of people are going to be affected in a negative way through these sorts of budget measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole point is that it was all unnecessary because the so-called savings involved in this are not huge. They do represent, however, a view of the world and society which has been totally discredited throughout the world. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> One of the ministers of the coalition government in an honest moment said to me, `I don't know what we are going to do.

<ELECTORATE> (Dobell)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.37 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by complimenting my colleague the parliamentary secretary to the opposition leader, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), on the contribution he has made tonight. I want to pick up and respond to some of the remarks he made at the start of his contribution in raising the issue of the state of the economy. I have to say to the honourable member that at least a dozen businessmen from my own electorate on the New South Wales central coast and people who have businesses that extend right across the nation have experienced an emerging fragility in consumer confidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already seen quite a few articles appearing in the financial press detailing how projected increases in consumer spending have not emerged. We have seen today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> talk about reductions in levels of investment. One of the merchant banks has scaled back its expectation for the level of economic growth for the country, which ultimately means fewer jobs for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For whatever reason, as this government has talked up the extent of its cutbacks, more and more people are worried about the security of their jobs and more and more people are postponing spending decisions. Less money being spent out there in the shops by families means that is ultimately encouraging business people to postpone and put off decisions that might otherwise have resulted in new investment and new jobs, and all of that is to be regretted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, the level of activity out there in the wider economy determines how much money the nation has at its disposal for our safety net, whether it is in social security, health or education. It is the general level of economic activity that ultimately determines the capacity of our nation to cater for people who are less well off. I think Australia can be pretty proud of the fact that whatever the faults we have had in our social security system over the years we have been able to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> address many of these measures in a sensible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock)&mdash;who represents the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman)&mdash;who very honourably is in the House to listen to the close of this debate, that we get disturbed by some of the measures that are contained in this particular piece of legislation and in other measures that will seriously affect people who are in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not to say that all the measures in the proposal are bad. There are a number of measures which the Labor Party supports, including measures that increase the flexibility of the arrangements for people on carers' allowances, carers' payments. That, plus the changes that allow people who have been out of the paid work force to look at opportunities for full&hyphen;time voluntary work, are measures which we on this side of the House welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there are some measures that we welcome, there are many other measures that cause us great concern. I would like to spend a bit of time on those. First of all, there is a section of this legislation that seeks to abolish the minimum rate for people who are less than 18 years of age. Basically, in effect, this imposes an income test, based on the income of the parents, on the payments that are going to these Australians who are under the age of 18 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our great worry is that at the very time when the government is out there consulting across the community trying to determine the format of its new youth allowance&mdash;which could, as I understand it, extend to people up to 25 years of age, not just those under 18 years of age&mdash;in effect, we have had that consultation pre-empted by this legislation imposing this new parental income test on payments which are going to Australians under the age of 18 years of age. We believe the government is heading in the wrong direction on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to draw the minister's attention to a decision implemented in this legislation which deals with the waiting periods that are applied to people who, for whatever reason, happen to lose their jobs or people who have need to call on assistance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5374"> from the Department of Social Security. These new arrangements will affect people who have left work but still have annual leave or long service leave owing. For example, it could affect someone who is in their late 50s who might know that their company is downsizing&mdash;to use that terrible word that seems to be in vogue at the moment. They might feel that it is better for the young people who work at that factory to keep their jobs rather than them, as someone in their late 50s, hanging on to their job. I know that there are many people in these sorts of circumstances on the central coast of New South Wales as the central coast is a mixture of commuters, people who work locally and retirees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past what has happened is that certain arrangements have been put in place to ensure that people are treated fairly if they have to leave employment and receive a payment for long service leave or annual leave. I have some concerns about the fairness of the new arrangements which are implemented in this legislation. The reason I am concerned about this is that at the moment on retirement a single person with more than $5,000 in liquid assets&mdash;or $10,000 for a couple&mdash;has to wait about four weeks before they can receive the pension. That is the current arrangement, as I understand it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new arrangements, the exempt areas are reduced to $2,500 for a single person and $5,000 for a couple and the waiting period is determined by dividing the assets by $500 if they are single or $1,000 if they are a family, with a maximum waiting period of 13 weeks applying. That is the system, as I understand it. I hope I have not got that mixed up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My great concern is that the result of these new arrangements is quite unfair. I would like to give three examples. First, if a single person retires with $10,000 in savings and no income, then under the arrangement, the equation that is outlined in this legislation, that person must wait 13 weeks before they are entitled to any support. So this person with $10,000 has to wait 2&half; months, they have to use up their life savings, before they are eligible to receive the age pension or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployment allowance which supplements their income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second example is a family with two kids where the breadwinner loses their job. Let us say that that family has $15,000 in the bank. Under that equation, that family has to wait 10 weeks before there is any support from the government. So, again, they have to use up part of their life savings before they get access to any government support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third example is of a wealthy businessman who, for any reason, decides to cease work, or someone who is on an extremely high salary, in perhaps the financial sector, and they lose their job. Let us say that they have $100,000 in the bank&mdash;many times what the other person in the family had in the bank. That particular person has to wait only that maximum period of 13 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the family of four with $15,000 and the single person with only $10,000 in the bank are treated almost exactly the same as that person with quite a large and substantial sum of money put aside. There is certainly no equity in the arrangements, as I have outlined. In relation to the increase in the waiting periods for people who happen to lose work&mdash;for whatever reason, often through no fault of their own&mdash;we think that these measures are quite unfair and are going to hurt people who are often in great need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure that particularly outrages me is the government's decision to abolish the earnings credit scheme. Given that the minister is in the chamber, I cannot help but quote back to him the statements he made in the second reading speech, which I know he personally would have drafted, or perhaps the minister in the other chamber might have drafted it. I would like to quote it back to the minister. This is the government's explanation as to why it has abolished the earnings credit scheme:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to its conceptual and procedural complexity, the earnings credit scheme is difficult to administer and is also difficult for social security recipients to understand. The limited understanding of the scheme by social security recipients puts in doubt its value as a significant incentive to take up casual work opportunities. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5375"> </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the minister said. That is his justification for abolishing the earnings credit scheme, a scheme that helps large numbers of people, often aged pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the earnings credit scheme do? It basically means that if someone has a job in Sydney at the Royal Easter Show, for example, where they earn more than they are normally allowed to during the short couple of weeks of the show but very little for the rest of the year, under the earnings credit scheme they are able to average that small peak in their non&hyphen;pension income over the rest of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also been described as the Father Christmas earnings credit scheme, Mr Deputy Speaker. If someone&mdash;I am sure you would never have worked in those circumstances&mdash;has worked perhaps as a Santa Claus in a department store, their earnings might be greater than is normally allowed under the social security incomes test, but they can average it out over the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, one of the best defences of the earnings credit scheme came from the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), who, in November 1995, made some remarks about the scheme. At that stage, he was criticising the government's attempts to change the scheme in 1995. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will come out of the pockets of pensioners who are able to earn a bit in a prime period and who, under the old rules, could then average that out so that they would not lose their entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that the Labor government would rip millions of dollars out of the pockets of pensioners and that he could never agree with that. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People need to understand that earnings credit scheme. I repeat that it provides an opportunity for people who have seasonal occupations with a very high level of income at a particular time to apply that credit over time so that their earnings&mdash;the normal allowance is $60 per fortnight . . . That is a reasonable thing to do. That is what a caring and compassionate government would do.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, what the honourable member for Cowper in those days argued for was a scheme maintained by a caring and compassionate government. It has now been abolished by the government of which he is a member. I would certainly hope that, if not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> here in public, in the chamber, the honourable member for Cowper is out there arguing for it in the National Party and that he is joined by some of the other conservative members of parliament in speaking up for this particular earnings credit scheme. They obviously have not been successful to date, but we can only hope that this government will think again about its decision to abolish this earnings credit scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that in my own electorate there are many thousands of pensioners on the New South Wales central coast who make use of this scheme. Certainly, from the many occasions I have had to talk to the staff at the Wyong and Entrance offices of the Department of Social Security, it is very clear that the staff get many inquiries about this from people who receive support through the local Department of Social Security. It is a great pity that the government is trying to walk away from the commitments they made before the election to maintain the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to quote from the Liberal and National Party social security policy, which made this statement before the election:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People who are unemployed should be given every incentive to work. If a person is not able to find full-time work, he or she may be able to obtain part-time work. Part&hyphen;time work will supplement the person's income, provide employment skills and assist the transition back into the full&hyphen;time work force. The earnings credit scheme will be retained by a coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA>That is worth repeating. In your summing up in this debate on the legislation, would you please explain to us why the cabinet of which you are a member, the government of which you are a member, has broken this pledge given to people who receive the age pension, to people who receive the veteran's pension and to people who receive support from the government, given your commitment that the earnings credit scheme would be retained by a coalition government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of this particular decision is that tens of thousands of people on very low incomes are going to have their pensions reduced for the periods in which they are doing that work, at the Royal Easter Show or for short periods, earning more than they are allowed to under the pension arrangements.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5376">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most callous decision in this particular package of legislation is in schedule 14, in which a maximum period for backdating payments under child disability allowance is now to be restricted to only three months. Up until now the department has been able to backdate this payment for a period of up to 12 months. It might seem strange, but with most applications for support from the government you are only entitled to that payment from the date on which you first apply. This particular payment is there to help families meet the additional cost that families bear if they have a child with a disability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that we provide special arrangements for this particular payment is that parents are often unaware that they do have a child with a disability until many months after they start making inquiries with doctors and they perhaps go down to their local community health centre to get some tests done. That is why we on this side of the House appeal to the government to think again about this particular measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that families who discover that a child has a hearing disability or who discover that their child has some disability that should ensure that their family gets a little bit of extra support should continue to be backdated for 12 months. The government's decision to impose a maximum backdating period of only three months is quite callous. We could only appeal to the minister to think again about that particular measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people in my own electorate who are living on the age pension often have a small amount of money put aside, often known as their burial money. A few thousand dollars put aside by a pensioner couple is there for the day when one or other of the couple pass away. I am very disappointed that the government has decided to extend the five per cent deeming rate to the first $2,000 that a single pensioner may have or the first $4,000 that a pensioner couple may have. Extending that five per cent deeming rate will cause a lot of heartache and confusion amongst those pensioners who in many circumstances are simply getting by on the base pension. For them to have to go through all of these financial calculations and to be forced to go <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down to their bank or credit union and try to work out how they can guarantee a return of five per cent is not always easy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sure, there are some financial institutions that will offer that package today, but it is my understanding that there are still a large number which do not offer a five per cent return on certainly that first $2,000. There are a number of financial institutions that unfortunately to date have not been offering that minimum five per cent on that first couple of thousand dollars of small deposits that are put aside for things like a burial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of those reasons, we on this side of the House have great concerns. Many of these cutbacks will hit people on low incomes quite severely. The government, for whatever reason, decided not to make minimal changes to tax expenditures such as the diesel fuel rebate, which makes substantial payments to mining companies and to large agricultural enterprises. Yet to help fund a diesel fuel rebate scheme that will cost the taxpayer about $1 billion this year, we are making cutbacks to families with disabled children. We are making cutbacks to an earnings credit scheme that lets pensioners who earn very little more than the base pension get a bit of part-time work. We are going to penalise people by extending the waiting periods for certain minimal amounts of government support after people have lost their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite unfair that these sorts of battlers are being punished so that this government can continue programs such as that diesel fuel rebate. We think that the government should have got its priorities organised in a better fashion. The government should not have been attacking and disadvantaging so many of these low income Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to thank all honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill. I welcome the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) to debates on social security issues. I was very interested to hear his observations about deeming matters in particular. I can recall in the last parliament <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5377"> having very considerable and lengthy correspondence with constituents of his in relation to changes that our colleague the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) was then dealing with. They were not always as accommodating about these matters as I am sure the honourable member would have been aware of if they were contacting him as frequently as they were me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill is a significant bill in that it serves to give legislative effect to many of the initiatives announced by the government in the context of the 1996 election or as a result of the 1996 budget. During his speech on the bill, the former minister, the member for Sydney, referred to the fact that his government had utilised what was by world standards for developed nations a comparatively low percentage of expenditure on social security and that it had sought to effectively target that expenditure. To that extent, there are many similarities in approach adopted by the former government to the approach being taken by the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government has done is to review virtually all social security programs and administration with a view to seeking to better target available funds. In many instances the bill does not dismantle initiatives put in place by the former government but seeks to assess whether the initiative can be delivered more efficiently and effectively and, having decided that it can, to ensure that improvements be put in place at the earliest available opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some instances, however, it has become clear that, while some initiatives might have some merit, the overwhelming evidence is that available funds could be better utilised on other initiatives. That applies to some of the matters raised by the honourable member for Dobell. Such an approach is a sensible one and one that the government believes it owes to both its social security customers in particular and the taxpayer more generally. The government makes no apologies for its approach, nor for the fact that this bill serves to address specific needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, this bill does respond to the needs of carers. This was one of a number of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matters that I know was highlighted by members on this side of the House in the course of this debate because there were a number of very positive initiatives. I want to focus on the carers initiative because it was one of the matters that was taken up by the coalition in its policy. Carers of the sick and elderly and the people with disabilities often go unrecognised, yet they provide an extremely valuable service to Australian society. They go about their work with dedication and sensitivity, without fanfare and often with small reward. Carers assist in minimising institutionalisation of the sick and people with disabilities by enabling them to remain in the familiar surroundings of their home. The government recognises the responsibilities and demands placed on carers and the important contribution they make to the community through this service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is demonstrating its commitment to carers through the introduction of the national carer action plan. Under this plan, the government will rename the carer pension the carer payment in recognition of the valuable work undertaken by carers in the community. The government will also provide increased flexibility of caring arrangements by relaxing eligibility requirements for that payment. Opportunities are being made for carer pensioners to utilise expanded respite provisions, firstly, through an increase in the number of days&mdash;the carer may temporarily cease to care without losing pension eligibility&mdash;from 42 to 52 days a year. This initiative acknowledges that carers are entitled to at least one day's break from caring each week. Secondly, there is an increase in the amount of time that a carer may spend either in paid work or voluntary work, training or study from 10 hours to 20 hours. This initiative will enable the smoother transition for carers when they are able to return to full&hyphen;time work and will assist them to update or maintain their skills while caring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that the opposition have indicated that they will not give their support to all of the measures contained in this bill. I would certainly urge them to reconsider the position they have adopted on this matter. There are very important provisions which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5378"> can be pursued. The bill itself reflects the government's priorities. I do not think it is safe to assume that there is a question of choice, that you can give way on some matters and expect that all of the other benefits will remain. It is not a question of being able to have your cake and eat it too. I would hope that the opposition, reflecting on the approach that they took when they were in government themselves, would have regard to the targeted nature of the changes that are proposed in these measures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the opposition's intention to oppose this schedule, which abolishes the minimum rate of payment to under 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. We consider that this is a singularly inappropriate measure for the reasons which I outlined in my second reading speech and which a number of other speakers have spoken about, a key point being that the government has announced that it intends to conduct a wide&hyphen;ranging review of income support arrangements for young people and to make this move at this point is obviously premature.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minimum rate of youth training allowance, sickness allowance and newstart allowance for customers who have not turned 18 was introduced to encourage young people to participate in training and other labour market activities. This initiative applies the parental means test, both income and assets, in full by abolishing the current minimum rate of payment of $65.75 per fortnight. The minimum rate is inconsistent with the treatment of Austudy where there is no such minimum payment. This anomaly can act as a financial disincentive for young people to pursue full&hyphen;time education. The full rate of payment will now be subject to the parental means test. This will remove the differences in the youth payment structure. The proposal will ensure that families support their children where they are financially able to do so.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be opposing schedules 10 and 11. Schedule 10 abolishes the earnings credit scheme. This is a de facto cut in the pension. If you look at the savings that this generates, out of whose pockets are these savings coming? They are coming out of the hands of pensioners and people on allowances.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>That is another flouted promise. So we believe that both of these measures are absurdly counterproductive. Rather than reduce the barriers to people who are taking up paid employment, these measures increase the barriers and reduce the incentives for people to take up part-time or casual work.

<ELECTORATE> (Wills)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.35 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw to the attention of the parliament two ways in which the government is adversely affecting the community of Brunswick, which I am honoured to represent. First, the Sydney Road Community School has contacted me indicating that it is appalled by the federal government's decision to abolish the national equity program for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> schools, which includes the disadvantaged schools program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In practical terms, the loss of that DSP funding will cost the Sydney Road Community School approximately $12,000 annually, which is more than 42 per cent of its current curriculum budget. This will be a severe blow to the school. Of a student population of around 90 students, they have five who are officially homeless and 60 per cent of students in years 7 to 10 have parents or carers who are health care card holders. Sydney Road Community School constantly strives to bridge the equity gap for students who are on low incomes, so the loss of DSP funding will seriously threaten the ability of those students to access some of their special programs, including school camps, excursions, music and art.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These programs are integral to the development of a close and supportive school community amongst and around the students which ensures that students who are struggling with the development of positive social relationships have the best opportunity to relate to and be supported by a caring community. The school is seriously concerned that the ditching of the disadvantaged schools program means that the federal government is denying all responsibility for addressing the inequalities experienced by disadvantaged groups in our society. The government has claimed that the DSP is to be incorporated into a new literacy program from 1997, so it appears that the government is saying that it is literacy problems that form the basis of disadvantage for students, thus denying any discrimination which exists around issues of gender, race and socioeconomic background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The literacy program, from all accounts, will be aimed at primary schools so those many students who are already in secondary institutions and are experiencing disadvantage will be relegated to society's growing rubbish heap. That school wants to know what provisions this government is going to make to ensure this decision does not increase the disadvantage already suffered by students in their school and others like them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter in which the government is adversely impacting on the Brunswick <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5382"> community concerns the Brunswick Employment Agency, which in particular provides support for people with disabilities who have a great deal of difficulty in entering the job market. The Brunswick Employment Agency tells me that their funding and service agreement has been completely altered so that from here on in they will receive no departmental assistance in relation to any issues of bankruptcy&mdash;for example, rent, staff, redundancy costs, hire purchase and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department has demanded immediate access to staff, audit within 30 days, 30 days notice of closure, no responsibility for debts and no responsibility for staff redundancy. Furthermore, the department is now saying to the Brunswick Employment Agency that any profit made from its activities has to be returned to the department and its grant will be reduced accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that talks a lot about incentive, but there is no incentive here for the Brunswick Employment Agency to do better. The department says, `We will now own all intellectual functions of all paid staff and any changes to capital needs must be approved by the department.' The committee of management has been told it has to sign this by the end of October or no funding will be received in November.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So they are negotiating in terrorem. They are unable to start small businesses which could generate a small profit because that is simply going back to the department. If they do not sign, they will not get any November payment. So they are in the situation where their funding and service agreement has been radically altered. It is a matter of `sign or else'. They are being told there are new targets to be set and it will be performance based funding from here on in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changed government policies will adversely affect the Brunswick Employment Agency. It is a hardworking and conscientious agency doing a lot of good in Brunswick and neighbouring communities with severely disabled people who do have difficulty entering the job market. I urge the government to rethink the funding and service agreement it is imposing on the Brunswick Employment Agency. I urge the government to rethink its <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> withdrawal of the disadvantaged schools program.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the electorate of Lindsay at the moment a lot of people are saying that the former member, Mr Ross Free, is guilty of sour grapes and the Labor Party is guilty of being a sore loser. Be that as it may, the real standard that needs to be applied in this by-election is his own standard, the standard that the former member, Mr Ross Free, set when he forced the electors of Lindsay to a by-election, the standard that he set when he forced the Australian taxpayer to shell out half a million dollars because, as he said, Jackie Kelly held an office of profit under the Crown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His standard is that it is absolutely improper for any member to run for parliament holding an office of profit under the Crown. As members would know, Ross Free was himself a former teacher in the New South Wales education system. As the Cleary case made clear, teachers must resign from the teaching service to avoid being guilty of holding an office of profit under the Crown. Mr Free certainly knew this because on 12 September 1996 he told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that he had had to resign from parliament three times to contest elections, but that is not what he thought in 1980. In 1980, before this office of profit under the Crown issue arose, he told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Penrith Press</EMPHASIS> that he had merely taken leave of absence from his teaching position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Freedom of information requests have been put in concerning the date of Mr Free's resignation from the New South Wales teaching service. A letter was received from the New South Wales Department of School Education on 8 July 1996 stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the documents concern the personal affairs of Mr Free, I am required to consult him before making any decision to release the documents to you.</PARA>
<PARA>Funnily enough, another letter came back on 25 July from the New South Wales Department of School Education saying:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5383">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Free&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>surprise, surprise!&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has not authorised you to have information concerning his personal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>The public has a right to know: does Ross Free have clean hands in this election? Does he come to the Australian people with clean hands or is he guilty of the same offence for which Jackie Kelly has been denied her seat in parliament? In the absence of any declaration by Mr Free that he did in fact resign from the teaching service, one is forced to conclude that he forced Jackie Kelly from the parliament.</PARA>

My question is: did the former member for Lindsay, Ross Free, uphold that same section when he entered the parliament originally?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is Mr Free must make available the information which the New South Wales Department of School Education has. If he is not prepared to do it, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) must force him to make this information available because the people of Lindsay are entitled to ask whether he came to this matter with clean hands. Otherwise the people of Lindsay will conclude that he himself has done exactly the same thing, that he is driving the people of Lindsay to a by-election and that he is causing the taxpayer to be out of pocket to the tune of $500,000 for the same offence that he himself committed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of Mr Free's clearing up this matter&mdash;and I urge him to do so most urgently&mdash;we are forced to conclude that Mr Free has one standard for Jackie Kelly and another standard for himself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cambridge Gulf Exploration was a concept of a Mr Conway, and I think it was a brilliant concept. His view was that diamonds which had been in the Kimberley, the oldest land mass in Australia, had ended up in the gulf. He set out to prove that they were there. The company started with a large fanfare. The shares went very well. They climbed 25c to a dollar, and then they took off and went as far as $4. It is quite clear that the shares were ramped&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;but it is equally clear they were not ramped by Cambridge Gulf or anyone associated with it because it had no shares available. All its shares were in escrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cambridge Gulf Exploration, as a result of responsibility they felt they had for their shareholders, did a six-month exhaustive study on where the shares had been traded. The ASC in Sydney agreed with their conclusions, and the ASC in Perth was made aware of the position. I have seen a letter from Cambridge Gulf's lawyer to the ASC in Perth which makes it quite clear they knew exactly what had happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During this period, the ASC in Perth, which I think is very suspect, had drilled Mr Conway intensively. I remember asking Mr <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5384"> Conway what he thought was the most interesting thing about this 72 hours of intensive questioning he had endured. He said to me, `I think the most significant thing was that I asked them, after all these hours of questioning, why they had not once asked me as the chairman why I thought the shares had risen rapidly and then dropped as rapidly. It was quite clear that the ASC in Perth were not interested.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the solicitors for Cambridge Gulf had shown the ASC the accumulation and sales of these shares in major proportions and their trading from County Natwest Sydney to Jardines in Hong Kong, the ASC's interest was not in seeing justice for the shareholders. It is quite clear that the ASC was protecting the establishment in Perth. I believe this involves a scandal of major proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are aware of the way John Elliott was treated by the ASC and the enormous costs that imposed on the taxpayers. I think John Elliott was treated badly, but he is big enough to look after himself. I know of situations that have occurred&mdash;in fact, one in relation to a former member of this House&mdash;where the ASC's behaviour has been absolutely appalling and where people in the end have been forced to plead guilty to minor offences because they could not afford the costs that they were put to by the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that this was a scandal of major proportions. The ASC is aware that the ex&hyphen;joint managing director of County Natwest was taking action in the Federal Court that would mean he would get his shares at 38c while County Natwest were selling them to its customers for $2. This was for a particular placement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The person in charge of the placement was none other than County's current managing director. Robert Pittorino and Robert Thomas were previously joint managing directors of County Natwest. Thomas remains to this day. With all this information, plus the knowledge that a particular broker in Perth, Hartley Pointon, had participated in round robins or the churning of shares, where they basically sold them to each other, they proceeded to lay no charges against these people but laid <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> charges against Conway for what can only be described as a very minor breach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASC is claiming that Mr Conway put out statements which were too optimistic. It is yet to be seen whether it will lay charges. Drilling is planned to take place starting in November. This company has acquired from the French the drilling rig from Mururoa Atoll&mdash;the most sophisticated drilling equipment in the world&mdash;and it may very well prove the truth of what the company said in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASC has&mdash;and I have written to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) about this&mdash;made it more difficult for Cambridge Gulf to get justice for its minor shareholders. I do not believe the ASC gives one damn about this. All it is intent on doing is supporting the interests of the establishment in Perth of which it is an integral part.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to acknowledge the work done by Nicki Jones and the women from neighbourhood houses and learning centres of the Southern Hills region in my electorate of Canning. These women spent several months toiling away on the special friendship quilt which was recently presented to me. The reason they made the friendship quilt was to celebrate Our Week 1996. Our Week was a joint celebration of Adult Learners Week and Neighbourhood House Week. This year the theme is lifelong learning for all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The neighbourhood houses and learning centres provide venues for many women to meet with each other in an informal setting. They enjoy a very social atmosphere and have the opportunity to study a large choice of subjects in a friendly and supportive environment. A variety of subjects may be studied at these centres, including arts and crafts, work force skills, personal development, health and fitness, self-motivation, and coping with families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Adult literacy is also taught at the neighbourhood houses and learning centres&mdash;a subject which is of the utmost importance. As <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5385"> we all know, many of the women who attend these community learning centres are mothers with young children or women who might otherwise lead a fairly lonely sort of life. By participating in the centre's activities, these women not only pursue artistic or academic interests but also establish very important social contacts and cement very strong friendships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The friendship quilt was coordinated by Nicki Jones of the Armadale Community Family Centre. I highly commend Nicki and thank her for all the hard work she has done to make this project the great success that it is. Contributions for the friendship quilt came from members of the Armadale Community Family Centre, Kelmscott Learning Centre, McFarlane House Learning Centre, Serpentine&hyphen;Jarrahdale Family Centre, Minnawarra Community House, the Roleystone Family Centre and the Armadale TAFE college.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quilt itself has distinct blocks or sections which represent the neighbourhood houses and local native flora bound by a gumleaf green background. My state of Western Australia has a wide variety of attractive native plants. Their adornment on the friendship quilt is quite striking. Indeed, the women who have worked on the friendship quilt have done a magnificent job to bring Western Australia's unique native flowers to life, especially when you consider that many of the women were completely new to these activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Davina Watson and her friends from the Kelmscott Learning Centre assembled the various sections of the quilt and put the finishing touches to it. Davina Watson best summed up the importance of this project when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The finished quilt is a masterpiece and reflects the many opportunities for adult learning that are unique to neighbourhood houses. Every technique of applique is represented, reflecting the diversity of our centres. Some of the women who made the blocks had never done anything like this before and those who were more expert were happy to pass on their knowledge. And, we had a lot of fun doing it.</PARA>
<PARA>This quilt will serve as a constant reminder of my duty as the people's elected representative of Canning. I am pleased to have a little piece of home taking pride of place in my office, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particularly one that contains the work and artistry of so many people. Naturally, Mr Speaker, I extend an invitation to you and all honourable members to view the friendship quilt currently on display in my office here in Parliament House. I look forward to explaining the various sections of the quilt and informing honourable members more about my electorate of Canning.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Fonseka, Professor Carlo</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="5385" TIME="10.54 p.m." SPEAKER="Wilton, Greg, MP" NAMEID="YK6" ELECTORATE="Isaacs" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YK6">Mr WILTON</NAME>
<ELECTORATE> (Isaacs)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.54 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I draw to the attention of the Australian parliament the presence in our country of an eminent Sri Lankan, Professor Carlo Fonseka. Professor Fonseka is Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Kelaniya in Sri Lanka. He is here on a medical study tour sponsored by the Universities of Adelaide, New South Wales and Newcastle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Fonseka has had a long history of humanitarian deeds. I cite as just one example of those deeds the fact that during the late 1970s and the 1980s Sri Lanka was running an inflation rate of something in excess of 50 per cent. But, despite that, Professor Fonseka, being the humanitarian that he is, was issuing prescriptions to his patients at no cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Fonseka is a man of many talents. He is a member of the Central Committee and Politburo of the Lanka Samasamja Party, the LSSP, which is the oldest political party in Sri Lanka and was originally formed to fight for national independence and the social democratic rights of Sri Lankan minority groups. His many other talents include the fact that he has produced over 50 publications on a range of subjects. One of his books, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a peaceful Sri Lanka</EMPHASIS>, was published by the World Institute of Development and Economic Research, which is part of the United Nations university based in Tokyo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a prominent member of the Rationalists Society, Professor Fonseka conducted research to contribute to the concept that `mythological beliefs are unsubstantiated'. Furthermore, Professor Fonseka has collaborated with well known author Arthur C. Clarke in producing a BBC documentary on the psychology of firewalking. Indeed, he has written lyrics and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5386"> composed melodies for many Sri Lankan songs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit of such a prominent Sri Lankan as Professor Fonseka to our country will no doubt encourage our Australian-Sri Lankan community to continue to immerse themselves in the Australian community to the great benefit of our country. For the record, Australian Sri Lankans show their appreciation of their own rich background and tradition by celebrating and sharing it with the wider community through cultural festivals. They are indeed noted for their hard work. Many of the thousands who have come to Australia have done so without assistance and have also established professional careers for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sri Lankans here have also added immeasurably to Victoria's reputation as an education centre. The level of education amongst Sri Lankans of the kind whom Professor Fonseka himself has taught is amongst the highest in Australia, and this has helped contribute to Victoria's social and economic development. Sri Lankans can contribute further to Australia's economic development by government and businesses harnessing the skills and knowledge of Sri Lankan businessmen to develop new trade opportunities for Australian firms in the Indian Ocean region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that the visit to our country of a person of Professor Fonseka's stature enhances the role of the Sri Lankan community here and encourages them to perpetuate their fine activities in the aforementioned regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that a prominent member of the Melbourne Sri Lankan community, Mr Jude Perera, will chair a public lecture to be given by Professor Fonseka on the topic `Critical analysis of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka'&mdash;a lecture which will no doubt attract many of the varying groups within the Australian&hyphen;Sri Lankan community when it is held at Monash University next Sunday, 27 October at 3 p.m. in the Rotunda Lecture Theatre. In saying that, I invite all interested parties to attend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome Professor Fonseka to Australia. I would also add that we are indeed privileged and honoured to have the professor in our country.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The report by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues made 163 recommendations for changes to the Child Support Scheme. Fifty three of the recommendations were of an administrative nature and were able to be addressed by the Child Support Agency without budgetary, legislative or policy implications.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also asked the Departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Attorney General, Finance, Social Security and the Child Support Agency to examine the operation of the Scheme and to report by the end of 1996.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The locations were identified using the Legal Aid and Family Services needs based planning model that has been developed specifically for the marriage and relationship education sub-program. This process takes into account the estimated target population of the area, the locations and levels of existing service delivery and the particular needs of regional and rural areas. Levels of funding for each State/Territory were calculated to reflect the target couple population and rounded to provide a significant whole number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) &amp; (b) Allocation of the money will be in accordance with established procedures. Advertisements calling for applications for funding were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5394"> placed in 56 national, daily and regional newspapers. In addition, media releases were sent to 95 national and local newspapers, 145 radio stations, and 67 television stations, advising them of the availability of the new funding. Under a merit-based selection process, all applications for funding for a particular statistical sub-division will be assessed independently and compared against others for that area. Stringent and objective processes are used to assess and evaluate applications against a range of criteria. These are:  the management structure of the agency; other related services provided by the organisation; local needs; community support or demand for the service; objectives of the service; course content; proposed staffing; staff training and development; supervision; evaluation; and the proposed budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each application is assessed using a consistent rating system to minimise discrepancies and ensure the necessary rigour. The assessment results are then processed by the Consultancy Services Unit of the Department of Finance using a computerised evaluation system. This procedure ensures that the agency or agencies in a particular area which offer the best outcome for the Commonwealth, in terms of levels and quality of service delivery, are allocated the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Under the Budget initiative, further funding will be available in mid-1997 for additional direct service delivery. The additional money will be used to pilot best practice or innovative approaches to service delivery identified as a result of a distance education project and an evaluation of the marriage and relationship education sub-program. Final details of how these services will be identified, where they will be located and how they will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operate, will be settled once these projects are completed in the first half of 1997.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr Moore</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) We have no official figures on total Japanese outbound by market for 1995. However figures released by the Japanese Ministry of Transport for 1994 show that Australia's market share was 5.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The cost of travel from Japan is one of several factors influencing tourism demand in that market. Airfares represent a significant part of the cost of a holiday in Australia for all international tourists. With this in mind, the Australian Government has adopted a liberal and flexible attitude towards the negotiation of our air services agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Government continues to act on several fronts to maximise Australia's share of the Japanese tourism market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expenditure by the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) on marketing in Japan is approximately $18 million annually. New market segments which are receiving particular attention include young families, independent travellers, school excursions and overseas weddings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATC will hold the second Australia&mdash;Japan Summit in Canberra in February 1997. The Summits provide an opportunity to discuss issues of mutual concern to tourism operators and to bolster Australia's market share. Issues discussed include infrastructure and air access, product pricing, marketing and distribution and visas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government officials from Australia and Japan met for discussions on tourism in June this year. The objective was to broaden tourism relations between the two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The meeting was the first of what is expected will become an annual event to promote increased tourism between the two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Japanese tourism to Australia is expected to be boosted by the introduction of the Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) in Japan in November this year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is testing the market for a possible sale of the NOMAD Human Resource Management system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) The Government believes (as did the previous Government) that, henceforth, systems of this kind should be developed and maintained by the private sector. NOMAD is a valuable product, with a large share of the Commonwealth market, customers committed to its use for several years, and the potential for redevelopment. It is in the best interests of the Commonwealth and customer agencies that competent private sector interests be given the opportunity to acquire it at a fair market price.</PARA>
