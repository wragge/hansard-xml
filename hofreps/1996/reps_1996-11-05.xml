Given the minister's frequent declarations of the importance of accreditation to the future development and reform of the child&hyphen;care sector, will the minister immediately repudiate recommendation 36 of the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, which recommends the removal of Commonwealth accreditation for child&hyphen;care centres?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow minister is quite right; I have made declarations about the importance of the accreditation system in the delivery of child care in this country. I do not resile from that at all, and neither does the government. We do support accreditation. We have said that consistently. As we outlined in our policy in the lead-up to the last election, we said that we would be reviewing the accreditation system. We will take into account all of the material available for us in undertaking that process and ensure that there is a very strong accreditation system for the child-care sector in this country.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the little bit where you said, `If this comes out I'll get on the front page like Gareth would.' Do you remember that bit of your speech? Well, it will be on the front page but it will not be tomorrow because today is the Melbourne Cup and we don't want you to lose publicity because of a horse race.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Aston asked a serious question because he is seriously concerned about developments in Zaire. I know that all Australians are concerned about developments in Zaire. Even members of the opposition&mdash;those who are sincere and concerned in their approach to politics&mdash;would share the concerns of the government and the Australian community about Zaire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three&hyphen;week cease-fire, which was declared unilaterally by the alliance of Tutsi rebels, is an encouraging development to the extent that it may, at least temporarily, put an end to the fighting and may provide international relief agencies with a window of opportunity for access to the hundreds of thousands of refugees stranded in Zaire. One offer of a cease-fire is not a permanent solution, but we welcome any steps that will at least enable aid agencies to take the necessary measures to alleviate the suffering of the refugees caught in the fighting. We hope that Zaire will cooperate in implementing the cease-fire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">African regional heads of government, who are to meet in Nairobi today, will give consideration to the issue of Zaire. We wish them well in this difficult and complicated task. A negotiated settlement by all countries in the region would be by far the best outcome.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We remain concerned that Zaire has said it will not participate in any regional talks so long as it believes that Rwanda is supplying arms to the rebels and as long as Rwanda occupies Zairean territory. However, we would strongly encourage Zaire to take a constructive approach to such regional initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the honourable member for Aston would be interested to know that I have instructed the Director&hyphen;General of AusAID, Mr Trevor Kanaley, who is currently in Ethiopia inspecting Australian aid activities, to proceed to Nairobi for discussions with international agency officials coordinating the emergency response to the crisis and I have asked him to report to me on constructive ways in which Australian aid can best be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expect the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs to issue a consolidated emergency appeal on behalf of UN agencies as soon as a needs assessment has been completed. The Australian government stands ready to make a contribution to the appeal as soon as possible after that.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Yesterday the Treasurer told the House that job growth in the September quarter was 0.5 per cent&mdash;`right on budget target'. But isn't it true that, according to the ABS, only 13,500 new jobs were created from June to September, a growth rate of just 0.16 per cent? Isn't the reality of the matter that the economy is dead, it is dead flat and that these employment figures of 0.16 per cent employment growth confirm just that?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Mr Speaker, it is not right that the economy is dead flat. That is right; it is not dead flat. Try as they might, the opposition have not been able to land a blow on the budget or land a blow on this government's economic management, and that is why it was the most popular budget since they started taking polls.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not interject if I were you. You had a bad day yesterday; you will have another one today if you keep that up. Gareth on what happened in the election: `As far as political massacres go, 1996 was of the low intensity variety. We simply weren't hated or despised in the way some past Labor governments have been.' Well, I would not kid yourself. There are piles of these things. Every time you interject I am going to remind you of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that in relation to economic management this was a government that took $70 billion of cumulated deficits and turned it around&mdash;$70 billion of cumulated deficits over five years. The Labor Party was a government which mortgaged the futures of Australia's young. It was a government which was prepared to run up debts to buy votes but had no concern about future generations of Australians. It was a government which had mortgaged and put our future in hock. It was a government which had run a current account deficit&mdash;the worst in the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what is the complaint that is now made by the member for Batman? The complaint that is now made by the member for Batman is that unemployment is at&mdash;what?&mdash;8.7 per cent, after you took it to 11 per cent. These are the people who look around and say, `Unemployment is only three per cent lower than we peaked at. What a terrible job you're doing.' It is like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. When we make housing affordability the best since 1984 he says, `Oh, that's only the best in 10 years. It could be the best in 20 years.' When mortgage variable rates were the lowest in 20 years he says, `What are you crowing about? It should be the lowest in 30 years.' The fact is we beat you on every single indicator. These are the people who are defying gravity in their economic attacks on the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that in relation to economic management we have the conjunction of low inflation and we have wage restraint. These are the matters that will be in the minds of decision makers. These are low inflation, low interest rate, low variable mortgage, high housing affordability and good economic <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prospects that this government stands for&mdash;and no wonder the Labor Party hates it!</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SK6">Mr TONY SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has the minister's attention been drawn to the sentence imposed on Wang Dan by the Chinese judicial system? Does the minister agree that the Chinese government needs to examine this case on the basis that Wang Dan's only crime was to be one of the leaders of the pro&hyphen;democracy movement and Wang Dan had the courage to maintain his commitment to democratic freedoms in China? Was the procedure leading to his conviction and sentence commensurate with due process of law as Australia knows it?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6494" SPEAKER="Downer, Alexander, MP" NAMEID="4G4" ELECTORATE="Mayo" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Foreign Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question&mdash;without notice. I am well aware that on 30 October the Chinese government sentenced Wang Dan to 11 years' imprisonment. Wang Dan is well known for his advocacy, as the honourable member knows, of democratic rights and freedoms. His case has attracted widespread international attention since he was arrested in Beijing in May of last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the previous Australian government and this government have been monitoring the case since Mr Wang came to prominence in 1989, and I am aware that the Parliamentary Amnesty International Group has taken a particular interest in Wang Dan's situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So you will learn something about it. The severe sentence and the speed with which the trial was conducted are obviously cause for serious concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well known that the Australian government of both sides has a longstanding policy of commitment to human rights and to fundamental freedoms, including freedom of speech and association. During my visit to China I raised Australia's concerns about human rights with China's foreign minister, Mr Qian Qichen, and stressed that Australia, as a country with a long liberal democratic tradition, held human rights as an issue of great importance. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6495">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just say in conclusion that we clearly have been concerned about the case that the honourable member raised of Mr Wang Dan. We, naturally enough, are in the process of expressing those concerns to the government of China in Beijing.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Mr GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I ask him: if it is not appropriate for Commonwealth departmental heads like Ted Evans to be paid extra remuneration for their membership of bodies like the Reserve Bank, why is it permissible for Mr Max Moore-Wilton, Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to draw an extra salary of more than $50,000 for continuing to chair the board of the Victorian Public Transport Corporation?

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation in relation to Mr Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton is as follows. When he was approached to accept appointment as the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, he had a number of positions in the private and public sector which gave him an aggregate remuneration significantly above the remuneration that he now receives. He discussed all of those things with me and he put to me, after discussion with the Victorian minister for transport, Mr Brown, the possibility of continuing the part-time chairmanship of the transport authority in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised because I understood the members of the opposition, when they were in government, saw the deeming arrangements as being very beneficial and thought they had developed a system which was well recieved. I will pick up the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6496"> specific matters raised by the honourable member for Hinkler.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He asked whether I am in a position to review the matter. I have to say I represent the Minister for Social Security in this place, but I do not make the decisions for her. The government does constantly monitor the appropriateness of the extended deeming rates. It assesses them against market rates that a person could reasonably expect to earn in safe investments. A fall or rise in official interest rates would not be the only factor that would be taken into account in deciding whether to change deeming rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We look at such matters as sustainability. We do not want to cause disruption to pensioners by too frequent changes in the deeming rates themselves. We do look at other factors that influence investments including bank deposits, shares and managed investments. All those matters are taken into account. Obviously, if and when any changes occur, the government would look at it again.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0K6">Mr BARTLETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of reports that there are very significant numbers of public hospital medical positions filled by overseas trained doctors because Australian trained doctors do not want them? Is there any substance to the claims that well paid public hospital positions are dead&hyphen;end jobs?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6496" SPEAKER="Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP" NAMEID="8E4" ELECTORATE="Chisholm" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Health and Family Services" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of reports. It is staggering that in two states alone&mdash;New South Wales and Queensland&mdash;there are 365 unfilled hospital positions. Many of these are very good positions paying up to $75,000 a year, so I was rather surprised to see them represented as dead&hyphen;end jobs by young doctors. I think young doctors need a bit of a reality check, given that most honourable members in this place would represent electorates with average incomes of about $30,000 a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it puts lie to is the claim that there are going to be hundreds of young doctors who have no prospect of practising medicine. In fact, I have checked the number of specialty training positions and general practice training positions as best I can. There are 400 training positions next year in general practice; 125 in anaesthetics; 21 in intensive care; 25 in obstetrics and gynaecology; 93 in psychiatry; 22 in ophthalmology; six in dermatology; 35 in radiology; 260 physicians; 54, general surgery; 10, cardio&hyphen;thoracic surgery; 11, neurosurgery; four, paediatrics; six, plastic and reconstructive; 20, urology; 29, orthopaedics; and nine, laryngology. That makes 1,102 training positions. That does not count emergency medicine, occupational medicine, paediatrics, rehabilitation medicine, medical administration, radiotherapy or pathology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6497"> When you add all those together and the other places that become available in speciali ty areas and general practice, the simple fact is that there are more jobs than there are doctors in training positions. The only reason a young doctor needs miss out on a training position is that he or she cannot be bothered to be fully trained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that for too long general practice has been a dumping ground for the medical profession. Bob Douglas of the ANU showed last year that a third of general practitioners would leave the profession tomorrow if there was something else they could do. Peter Baume, in a report last year, showed that general practice had been progressively deskilled over 20 years. It is time that general practice was given the status, the training and the backup that it deserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, this is incredibly in the public interest. General practice is the basic primary health care in Australia, and to have it detached, deskilled and disillusioned is a tragedy for Australia. I understand the changes put some obligations on young doctors. I understand that it is a change from what they expected. But, without this measure and without the limiting of overseas trained doctors, the fact is that general practice would have no future whatsoever.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because it works well for those industries that are covered, and it is a much preferable system to the non-existent prescribed payments system which otherwise would operate. As I said to the member for Moore when he last asked me this question, that does not mean that you should not keep under review the operation of the tax system. We always do.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I just say to the honourable member, who I know is concerned about this situation in Sri Lanka, that the Australian government is concerned about the tragic suffering of civilians in that country. The intensified conflict in the north has displaced thousands of people, and the bombings this year, allegedly by the LTTE, in Jaffna and Colombo killed or injured hundreds of civilians on all sides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the conflict is primarily one for the main participants in Sri Lanka to resolve, but we are taking every opportunity in our contacts with the Sri Lankan government to encourage progress towards a peaceful resolution and to add Australia's voice to calls to all parties involved to look for and negotiate its settlement. We would see some value in third party mediation or good offices in the conflict, provided that such mediation was acceptable to both the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE and that both sides were willing to engage in genuine negotiations. The present environment in Sri Lanka appears not to be conducive to constructive negotiations of that kind to be mediated by some third party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just say in conclusion that on the humanitarian situation Australia has provided substantial emergency assistance to large numbers of people displaced by the conflict in the north of Sri Lanka and has allocated <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6498"> $4.2 million to relief purposes in 1996-97. I also want to say&mdash;I think that the honourable member would be interested to know&mdash;that we frequently get requests for a meeting with me from representatives of the Sri Lankan Tamil community. I want to make it clear to the House that my position is that I will not see Tamil groups in Australia unless they indicate to me in writing that they condemn the terrorist activities of the LTTE. Given this government's strong and principled position on terrorism and political violence, I am sure that the honourable member would well and truly understand this position.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

That was the Labor Party performance&mdash;to triple <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6502"> Commonwealth general debt over three years, with underlying deficits over five years of $70 billion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would be the future for young people in Australia if we told them that they had to pay taxes not for their health care but for this generation's health care? What would be the situation if we said to the young people of tomorrow that this was a government which after five years, although it had told the Australian people that it had balanced the accounts, was running a deficit of $10,000 million? They were out by $10,000 million! Right throughout the election campaign the people of Australia were being told that the accounts were balanced. They were wrong by $10,000 million. And total Commonwealth net debt rose $8 billion to $101 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that means, as the member for Deakin will know, is that servicing debt in this country now ranks with our expenditure on education. Servicing past debt ranks with our expenditure on education. It ranks with our defence budget. It is one of the large items built into the Commonwealth accounts from which there is no escape: Labor's legacy to future Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great thing to be able to say to the member for Deakin is that, because this is a government that had the strategy, a government that had the courage to sit down and do it over three years time, notwithstanding sabotage from Labor, we will be in a position to balance the accounts and stop that debt escalating.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr JULL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the government policy that frequent flyer points accrued by senators and members in the course of official travel should be used to meet the cost of further official travel. Senators and members were requested to notify my department of the use of the points so that accurate records could be maintained. It is correct that no senator or member has formally notified the department that he or she has redeemed frequent flyer points since the introduction of the policy. I wrote to all senators and members in July advising them of the new procedures on the use of frequent flyer points. The fact that my department has not been formally notified of the use of the points suggests that some senators and members and their staff may not be aware of that requirement. So I am writing again to all senators and members to remind them of the procedures for using points and the importance of reporting their use to the department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes it is not acceptable to Australians that parliamentarians, or any others whose travel is paid for from the public purse, should obtain personal perks through doing their job. That is why the policy was introduced.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Did the Prime Minister's Chief Political Adviser, Grahame Morris, consult him before he wrote to the Assistant General Manager of OGIA, Ms Cathi Moore, telling her that DDB Needham Adelaide should be on the original list of propositions to be examined for the gun control advertising contract, because there is no doubt in some ministers' minds that this is the benchmark for the communication program? Which minister was Mr Morris referring to, if he did not consult with the Prime Minister or Attorney&hyphen;General?

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr JULL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been waiting for about three weeks for a question on this particular contract. I am absolutely amazed that I have not received one as yet. The suggestion by Mr Grahame Morris was simply that, because of the interest that had been shown in the DDB Needham proposition for that campaign, maybe they should be considered. That was all that was there. I remind you that the short list of people who decided that panel of advertising agencies consisted of officials from OGIA, the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, the Commonwealth law enforcement agency and representatives from the Prime Minister's office in the form of Mr Morris and the office of the Attorney&hyphen;General. A member of my office, Penny Farnsworth, was present but she was not a member of that panel and she did not vote or express a view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, while Mr Morris may have made the suggestion, the fact is that the short list of three was agreed to by a full assessment panel. No member of that panel voiced any objection or expressed any concern about the short list. I think it is absolutely amazing that in the Senate we have had these accusations of a political fix to look after mates. It is absolutely amazing that we must be so hard up to look after our mates that we meet in committee from 5.30 in the afternoon until 10 past midnight. We must be so stupid that we invite the New South Wales Labor Minister for Police to come along and have a vote, and we ask the Australian Capital Territory Minister for Police to come along and have a vote. If you reckon we are trying to rig under those circumstances, frankly, you're a bigger pack of dills than I ever took you for.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I thank the member for La Trobe very much for his question. He is of course right: unless the literacy issue can be properly addressed in the early years of schooling, it is very difficult to correct the literacy difficulties of students later on. That is why the government has introduced a new literacy goal that every child should be able to read, write, spell and communicate by the end of primary school. It is also why we have introduced, and will be introducing with the states and territories, national standards for years 3 and 5 in primary school which will meet the needs of students in those early years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the House would be particularly interested to know that over the next four years the government will be putting some $635 million into literacy programs. That will include specific targeted programs aimed at these early years of schooling. The expert evidence certainly does confirm what the member for La Trobe has said.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People working in agricultural industries in Australia dependent on very strong quarantine protocols have reason to be concerned about the early performance of the Howard government and the performance of the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in its first few months. It is not just about imported cooked chicken meat. It is a very real question of quarantine issues across a range of products, and producers are now starting to come forward. I include salmon producers from Tasmania, who are becoming concerned, apple producers, and pear producers, who are threatened by the risk of fire blight disease from New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's performance at question time today only serves to heighten those concerns. The minister's answers were, I think, very slippery indeed. It has been my experience that when ministers resort to answers that are slippery it is because their actions are suspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are our suspicions? The first thing that has happened is that the minister has very clearly reneged on an unequivocal coalition undertaking and promise in this area. He wrote in February of this year, when he was the shadow minister, to the President of the Mangrove Mountain Districts Community Group. This is a letter I sought leave to table during question time today and leave was denied. What did you have to hide? Now I have to read it in here. It is a letter in which the minister, when he was the shadow minister, very clearly said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Coalition Government will suspend the approval of all proposed new import protocols, including the one for salmonid products, until such time as the scientific review has been completed and its recommendations acted upon in full.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a very clear undertaking and it is now being breached. He has been caught out not only by us but also by his coalition partners. I am sure he was very uncomfortable as he watched the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>  last Wednesday night on the ABC when it was covered, in particular when Ray Moynihan raised the question. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at a private Liberal Party meeting in early October, the Prime Minister indicated that any decision on chicken meat would come to Cabinet. The PM's comments highlight just how sensitive <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an issue this is for a government dependent on a large rural constituency. And they could signify a major change in quarantine policy, moving decision&hyphen;making from AQIS firmly into the political arena.</PARA>
<PARA>He further went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister has told a private party room meeting that any decision on chicken meat will have to get Cabinet approval.</PARA>
<PARA>They have taken it out of your hands. That is what has happened. Even the Liberal Party has become pretty concerned about the way you have been handling this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It goes further than this. In question time today, he tried to pass it off on us. He made the claim, as he was reported to have done by AAP on Friday last week, that he was moving in this direction because the previous Labor minister had already taken the decision. Today, he tried again to create the impression that former Minister Collins had already taken the decision. But, of course, we know what happened: the minister saw the report and noted it. Anyone, particularly in this place, who has been in these positions knows very well that there is one hell of a difference between noting a report and taking a decision to implement its recommendations. To stand up there and portray that the minister had already taken the decision&mdash;and that is why you are breaching your undertakings&mdash;is trying to slide around a broken promise. That is what we are talking about here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To do what you did to me today&mdash;to misrepresent my position, to bring in a personal note I wrote to you, which I dealt with a little earlier&mdash;simply underlines the fact that you are getting desperate. Your coalition partners are concerned about your handling of this matter and you are resorting to tactics. While the Prime Minister claims to be looking for high standards from his ministers, he will probably have a word to you about this at another point.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As they did in opposition. We have been absolutely straight with all constituencies about our position on this, including our position in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. It is a unanimous report. Both sides have supported the recommendations. A very interesting point is made in the overview, particularly in relation to imported chicken meat, and I think it would do the minister well to study and understand it. You are treading on very dangerous ground, and I will go into this in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decisions that you take and are taking at the moment are very important decisions not just for the chicken meat industry, not just for other agricultural producers and the people who work in value adding and rely on the markets but also for Australia's international clean green image as a food supplier. The decisions you take are important decisions that have to be strongly based. The committee report says, and I suspect they must have understood what was likely to happen:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee fully understands that any breakdown of the cooking and certification process will not necessarily result in disease outbreaks. However, the Committee believes AQIS's reputation will be irretrievably damaged if IBD&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, infectious bursal disease&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or ND&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, newcastle disease&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">enter the country via a cooked chicken meat importation under its control.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: the committee believes AQIS's reputation&mdash;that is, Australia's reputation&mdash;will be irretrievably damaged if you get this wrong. You are heading down the path of getting it very wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are party to recommendations that support the WTO process on trade. We are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> party to section 2.12 of that report under international obligations where we outline that `quarantine decisions must have a sound scientific and technical basis'. We are not arguing that you put up quarantine as artificial trade barriers; we are arguing that it has to have a sound scientific and technical basis. The report says that they have to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> . . . flow from a proper process of risk assessment;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> AQIS must adopt a consistent approach to risk management, that is, not arbitrarily adjust the acceptable level of risk from case to case;</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>We accept that. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> access decisions must be designed to achieve the determined level of risk in the least trade restrictive way; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the decision making process must be transparent and open.</PARA>
<PARA>We accept that right across our frontbench. Our shadow minister for trade, Mr Smith, has been very strongly arguing these points to me&mdash;even in the last 24 hours&mdash;as has our shadow minister for primary industries. There is a commitment on our side. There is an understanding of that commitment. That is why your behaviour today was way beyond the pale and reflects the actions of someone who is getting pretty desperate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, we are becoming concerned that what could have been and should have been a bipartisan follow-through of a process that we set in motion and supported has now changed because of widespread concerns about your actions. Just as the Senate committee and I have said&mdash;I refer to your comments on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> relating to risk&mdash;you said that Australia cannot have a zero risk quarantine policy. We agree. We have never said anything different. But the obligation lies with you to start outlining what is the acceptable level of risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing, Minister, in a number of these issues that even the science is not clear and defined. When asking about the acceptable level of risk, or what is the risk factor, you can have a situation where AQIS says that there is an unlikely risk of an importation that could cause disease among an Australian product that does not have that disease at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6509"> moment and science saying that the risk is inconclusive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Experience says that if AQIS says it is unlikely and science says it is inconclusive then you have got to take a pretty cautious approach to it. Whatever the risk, it is unacceptable for you to not give guarantees that are very strong for Australian producers.</PARA>

When you wrote that letter to the Mangrove Mountain Districts Community Group and gave that undertaking that no changes would occur until such time as the scientific review was completed and its recommendations were acted upon in full, you did not know two things. You did not know that if and when you became minister you would move to break those undertakings&mdash;you now have&mdash;and you also did not know that your parliamentary secretary would rat on you. You got up here today and tried to purport that the previous Labor minister took the decision and that you are effectively carrying it through.

Now we know where you stand, you great champion of rural Australia and its needs from the Hunter Valley&mdash;just like your old man. You will run the populist line every time without doing your homework, and that is why, in direct contrast to what the farm groups in this country would urge you to do if they were aware of your position, you urge us to renege on our obligations under GATT. No doubt you will be speaking next, and you can trot out your answer and say that it is highly qualified, but I reckon that is pretty simple language.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just make this point: what we have heard from the shadow minister at the table is the same trick of saying, `No, the minister did not sign off it,' but we are hearing from the ex-minister himself when he knows full well that that is not the issue. The way they set up the legislation&mdash;with our support; it has not been changed&mdash;is that AQIS does the technical risk assessment work and the director makes a decision. That then goes to the minister. All the minister does is note it. He did not annotate it. He noted it. He signed it. His responsibility then&mdash;and the responsibility that I had from its being on my desk, because of the way in which the process had proceeded well down the road&mdash;is to satisfy himself that the process has been done properly.

It is a great shame that the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) has sought to politicise this debate. I intend to answer the political points. I begin by saying that it is typical of the utter gall of this mob to try to imply that we are lowering Australia's quarantine standards. It was us who pushed you so hard to conduct a full independent scientific inquiry into AQIS. Your then minister held out for as long as he possibly could. He finally did it. But it was as a result of the pressure that we brought to bear, along with industry, that you finally put together Professor Malcolm Nairn's inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, in government, as one of my first actions, moved to expand its evaluative capacity, and it is about to report. Like the government of the day, like the opposition at the time, like the Senate inquiry, like the farm groups in this country, anybody should look at it objectively and away from the sort of hypocrisy that is reflected in this MPI&mdash;because that is what it is. You thoroughly deserve to be revealed. I need not have quoted your letter. I could have gone to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot escape the obvious conclusion, the only conclusion, that can be drawn from the letter that you sent to me. You asked for it with this utter hypocrisy. What is more&mdash;it is not just hypocrisy&mdash;it reflects an extraordinary lack of research and understanding. No wonder your former Minister for Trade has left the chamber, because he knows how far off the mark you are, what weasel words <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> certain people on your side are using in relation to this matter.

We continue to maintain it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We export more than five times as much as we import. So we have a great interest in a stable set of international trade laws. That is why the farm groups and the previous government, with our support, pursued stable trading laws for many years. Part of that is the SPS agreement, supported, as recently as last week, by the Senate committee. It made it quite plain that we ought to oblige the provisions of the  agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures. But, all of that notwithstanding, we do and will maintain our conservative approach. That is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6511"> reflected in the recent decision&mdash;a very interesting one&mdash;to actually reject, on scientific grounds, an application by industry to support 14,000 fertilised eggs from Denmark. We have rejected it. We are quite happy to reject things when it is appropriate to do so. But you left us, apart from anything else, with a bank&hyphen;up because you would not act on your own policy&mdash;a bank&hyphen;up that now has us being laughed at internationally.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found this mess on my plate, and I have made it plain in this place that we will stand by the commitment we gave. We will not progress further access requirements until we have the Nairn review in place and have adopted the recommendations. But understand this: your minister, whatever weasel words he likes to use, noted the advice. Under the procedures that you put in place&mdash;let me repeat it again till I am blind, because I hear some pretty clever and slippery lines floating around the place&mdash;he noted it. The director of quarantine makes the decision. Under your legislation, in those circumstances&mdash;and you know this is the case&mdash;the minister has to satisfy himself that due process is being followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your minister at no stage indicated that he had any doubt about the science. And neither, for that matter, did the bureau. This is what I did not know in opposition when I wrote that letter. I will be quite open about it. I wish I had known. But when you are in opposition there are certain things you do not know, as you are increasingly finding out and as is increasingly being reflected in your cheap populism. I did not know that it had been noted; nor did I know that the objective which I was trying to put in place&mdash;which was that AQIS's scientific capacity ought to be properly checked off by independent scientists&mdash;had been done by BRS, by AAHL and, interestingly enough, by those who spoke for the science on behalf of the chicken growers themselves.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would Australia, with the full support of the farm groups, go down the road of seeking a stable set of international trade laws, including the SPS agreement? Would we do it out of the goodness of our heart because we simply wanted to invite everybody who wanted to import into this country to have open slather? Is that why they would have done it? Is that why we would have supported it or the farm groups would have gone on with it? Of course not. Good trade policy is all about enlightened self-interest. It is all about net benefit to the rural communities. That is what it is about. That is why you had our support for this broad approach. That is why the farm groups broadly supported it. The fact is that it has been producing benefits. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6512"> I ought to give you some credit for it. It is actually beginning to produce some benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great pity that you have sought to politicise this issue. It is important that we explain to the Australian people that enlightened self-interest is the right approach to trade. As a result of the Cairns group/ GATT/WTO, we have gained very significant extra access to the US market for beef. Here they are looking on and wondering why in the name of good fortune&mdash;when your minister notes that this is ready to progress&mdash;nothing happens for nine months. The position you left the director of quarantine in and the position you left Australia's international standing in had to be taken into account when I looked at the mess you had left me. You left me with a mess to clean up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that we have been winning things like access to California for citrus, access to the Philippines for citrus, increased access to Taiwan for a range of agricultural products, rice into Korea and rice into Japan. We have an interest in stable, agreed international trade laws, and that is what this is all about. Since gaining office, the government has pushed on with improving bilateral trade arrangements. We intend to keep going, but we want to be able to do so on the basis of our international credibility. Here you have the supposed alternative government in a very cowardly and misleading way walking away from their own position, because that is what you are doing. Why on earth can't you have the courage to stand up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know what is more illustrative than what they do say on this matter? It is what they do not say. Let the ex&hyphen;Minister for Trade and the ex&hyphen;Minister for Primary Industries and Energy come out and actually say, `No, we weren't going to let it in. No, we don't believe the process was properly followed. No, basically, we are not going to progress it.' Let them just say that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard a suggestion in here that we are not considering this properly and not thinking this issue through properly. While in the process of cleaning up their mess, in consultation with industry, I set up two working groups. One was to look at the technical aspects of imports, which you did not do, and the other <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> one was to look at adjustment issues. That is what we have put in place. If that does not reflect consultation and the desire to take into proper account the impact on industry, what does? The simple fact is that we have done what you did not do. I am awaiting the outcome of those arrangements prior to, on my own volunteering, taking a broad based paper&mdash;it is mine&mdash;to cabinet on Australia's trade and quarantine arrangements so as to seek confirmation of the broad approach taken.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can attempt to reinvent the wheel, but I am simply telling you the truth as it stands. I want to turn to a couple of other points in the short time remaining to me. I want to again emphasise the way in which the procedure worked. I wish to put on the record again that what I did not know and what I could not have known in opposition was that after seven years of analysis, scientific study and discussion the former minister had a final report from AQIS in May 1995 indicating its technical assessments were complete and that access would be granted to the USA and Denmark subject to the fulfilment, as specified in strict conditions, which we are progressing right at this moment. Access to Thailand would also be granted subject to the outcome of processing plant inspections. The former minister, I repeat, noted this. He signed off on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AQIS intended to take the formal decision on entry after the former minister concluded further consultations with industry, but he did not do so. On the industry's own admission, nine months went by and nothing happened. Procrastination and mismanagement by the former minister left the director of quarantine open to legal challenge and Australia susceptible to international trade challenge. Faced with this situation, I did the only sensible thing I could: I opened up consultations with the industry and I set in place the two groups that I have just mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of all of this, I want to conclude by making the obvious point that when it comes to regional representation on that side, firstly, they have not learnt the lessons. They were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6513"> comprehensively thrown out because they would not hold a policy position and they would not deliver from rural Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noted with great interest the state of the government frontbench during the contribution from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). I think that probably reflects pretty well the attitude of the cabinet to this very important issue. I did note that the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) and the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) were present. That is good to see.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted even more importantly the strong representation here from members of the National Party. Like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, they know the devastating impact of this decision. They understand how the minister's mishandling of this decision will affect people living in rural and regional Australia. How disappointed they must be by his defence. All the minister wants to talk about is trade. But there is no reference to trade liberalisation in this MPI. There has been no concern expressed by our side about the government's approach to trade, because they are doing it no differently from the way we were doing it. We were very proud of the way we were doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This MPI is about quarantine and the minister's inept handling of the quarantine issue, particularly in relation to the importation of cooked chicken meat. The unanimous findings of the all&hyphen;party Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee are a damning indictment of Minister Anderson's handling of this issue and represents a vote of no&hyphen;confidence from his coalition colleagues on the committee. It recommends a sensible, well&hyphen;considered approach and offers real hope to a $2 billion industry that employs at least 45,000 people nationally and up to 3,000 people in the Hunter. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the coalition senators who sit on the committee, I call upon the minister to immediately embrace the recommendations of the committee and to act upon them. The Senate committee has recognised that the proposal to allow for the importation of cooked chicken meat poses a real threat to the industry and to Australia's native bird population. Unlike the minister, the committee has been reluctant to accept AQIS's recommendations and its guarantees that the importation of cooked chicken meat can proceed without the risk of the introduction to this country of the dreaded newcastle disease and the infectious bursal disease. Unlike the minister, the committee has listened to the industry and was left holding grave doubts about the science underpinning AQIS's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the minister's embarrassment does not end there. The committee has recommended that the government should do what the minister was unprepared to do, and that is to look seriously at a GATT friendly assistance package if, in the longer term, we are unable to gather enough scientific evidence to deny the importation of cooked chicken meat into this country. It is a question of science, not a question of trade policy. But the minister's embarrassment does not end there either. The committee, chaired by their own Senator Winston Crane, has recommended that the Quarantine Act 1908 be amended to put the final decision not in the hands of the minister necessarily but, to use their own words, back into the hands of the minister `and/or the government'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know in public life that words can be bullets. This bullet, Minister, is directed at you, and it comes from your own side. This is why they are in here. This is, of course, a very subtle vote of no confidence in you from your own side&mdash;and you know it. They have no confidence in the minister's ability to competently handle this application or, for that matter, any future applications, whether they be with respect to salmon, apples or pears. His handling of the issue has sent shock waves through the chicken industry, and it has those who work within the apple, pear and salmon industries shaking in their boots.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6514">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue has been running for months now. What have we heard from the minister? The same thing we heard today: `It is all Bob Collins's fault. I'm innocent. I'm not a party to it. It was all said and done before I arrived here.' The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) has already referred to the letter&mdash;which he sought to table&mdash;from the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), where he clearly states that the former minister only noted the AQIS recommendations. I do recognise one thing. I do recognise that the parliamentary secretary did get it wrong when he said that it is not yet legislated. That in itself expresses his total ignorance of how the act works. But we do have from the parliamentary secretary a letter which confirms without any doubt and which makes it very clear that former Minister Collins did not give his imprimatur to this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Quarantine Act, the final decision on these matters does not rest with the minister of the day, as you have quite rightly pointed out. But the minister is responsible for the act, as you know. As part of the process AQIS seeks the minister's imprimatur. It did not get the former minister's imprimatur, I can assure you. It is in this area that we find the greatest differences between the former minister's approach and the current minister's approach to the applications from Thailand, Denmark and the United States to import cooked chicken meat into Australia. As I said, AQIS does not require the minister's approval, but it does have to seek his imprimatur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Anderson's story is a much different story from that of former Minister Collins. He was very quick to give the proposal the tick, despite his written guarantee to the industry, before the election, that he would not allow chicken meat to be imported before the Nairn review had been completed. The member for Burke has referred to Minister Anderson's letter. It is dated 14 February 1996, nicely just prior to the election. I will just quote the last paragraph where he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Coalition Government will suspend the approval of all proposed new import protocols, including the one for salmonid products&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>but that is a typo, obviously, I think he means chicken; the rest of the letter is all about chicken&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">until such time as the scientific review has been completed and its recommendations acted upon in full.</PARA>
<PARA>You cannot be any more clear than that. Let me paint a picture for the House. Let me tell you what really happened. There is Minister Anderson, sitting behind his big ministerial desk. He has been there only a couple of months, and he is feeling pretty important. He is contemplating his determination to show his bureaucrats how tough he can be, how well he can get across a ministerial brief, and how determined he is to take the tough decisions. The next thing you know AQIS rolls in. These are the people, of course, who have been seeking Senator Collins's imprimatur for months. But he proved too cautious and too determined to protect the interests of the industry from disease. But the same cannot be said for Minister Anderson. `You have to agree with this,' the AQIS bureaucrats said. `We're obligated under the rules of the World Trade Organisation.' So what happens? In typical <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>  fashion, the two&hyphen;month&hyphen;old minister says, `Well, give me the bit of paper. I'm ready to tick.' Let's look at the way the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  covered the incident. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At 5pm last night the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr John Anderson </EMPHASIS> had signed off on a politically sensitive protocol allowing the importation of cooked chicken meat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If he hasn't already, he soon will have," an aide said confidently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conversation with our correspondent then proceeded something like this.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aid: (unintelligible gurgling noise).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Us: "See you."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suddenly it was 5.30: the aide was on the line. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6515"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aide: "I was wrong. The minister hasn't signed off after all. He's going to consult with the industry first."</PARA>
<PARA>He just stood here and told the House that there was no opportunity for the minister to sign off. He does not seem to understand or that certainly does not seem to be the message being communicated by his staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, when the industry representatives read the article, they went ballistic&mdash;and why wouldn't they? They had been given an ironclad guarantee by the minister prior to the election that he would take no such decisions until the Nairn review had been completed. What did he do? He tried to keep blaming Senator Collins. But, of course, when that did not work, he tried something else. He established two joint government&hyphen;industry task forces, which he has mentioned. I will tell you how often they have met. One task force was to look at the protocol issue and the other was to look at industry restructuring. The first has met twice, the second once&mdash;three meetings in total. This is the minister's initiative. It is just absolutely unbelievable!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the minister doing while all this was going on? He was still out there on the airwaves telling all and sundry that the decision will proceed because Minister Collins has already put the whole process in place. So he is setting up two committees, he is asking them to meet and, while they are meeting, he is on the airwaves saying, `Well, it's going to go ahead anyway.' Notwithstanding the all&hyphen;party report that came down from the Senate last Thursday, on Friday he was still saying the thing will go ahead. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a flight of fancy! What a featherweight fight has been put up by the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe). I stand here as the Liberal participating in this debate. I am not here because I was sucked in by the whip's office and I am not here because I was called simply to make the coalition look cohesive. I am here because, as I walked down the corridor at the close of the party meeting, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said to me, `This is the MPI.' I said, `That's an MPI I would like to be involved in because I know just how much <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nonsense we have had from the opposition about the status of the minister and his involvement.' Unlike everyone on the other side, including my coalition colleagues&mdash;except the member for Murray (Mrs Stone)&mdash;I know what happened in the Liberal Party meeting when this was discussed. There has been all of this nonsense running about some sort of vote of no confidence in the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely you realise&mdash;certainly the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) realises&mdash;that this is the most important matter that Australian primary producers have had to deal with since we came into office, certainly the most important matter since the issue of uncooked pig meat was dealt with by you in government in precisely the same way. Because it is such an important matter, it was raised in the Liberal Party room where there was not a whisper of no confidence in the minister. The comment was, `Since this is so important, we ought to strengthen the minister's arm by getting frontbench approval.' That's why it has gone to cabinet&mdash;because we think this is important enough to warrant cabinet intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike those opposite, I happen to have a particular interest in AQIS and a particular interest in the clean and green image of Australian exports. I will not stand silent when this sort of nonsense is being run in this chamber this afternoon by the member for Burke and the member for Hunter. Why do I have a particular interest? Because, as Mr Crean knows, I am in an area which happens to be uniquely fruit fly free in Australian terms and, for that reason, I have grown up in a quarantined area, an area in which the standard of AQIS and the standard of quarantine was absolutely important. I will tolerate nothing that compromises Australia's quarantine standards, neither will the minister and neither will any member of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6516"> Here we are dealing with the fundamental question of imported cooked chicken meat. The nonsense you are running suggests that in some way the minister is compromised when he has done precisely the opposite. But does it concern anyone opposite that all of this argument, including the member for Burke's MPI, may in some way itself compro mise Australia's image overseas? No. If it is popular&mdash;and I know that this is popular because I know what my chicken growers are saying&mdash;let's run it. If it damages the AQIS reputation, that does not matter because there might be votes in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The grim reality is that we cannot afford to stand up here and be unnecessarily critical of AQIS because it not only implies that what comes into Australia comes in and is not adequately supervised; it also suggests that what goes out&mdash;our clean and green image&mdash;is in some way compromised as well. It is inexcusable and unforgivable for the member for Burke to hang AQIS out to dry without any adequate evidence. That is what he has chosen to do with this MPI today. Why am I passionate about this? Because we are going through it now with cooked chicken meat and we had to face precisely the same dilemma over salmon and apples. We, the government, do not intend to compromise on any of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be fair to the member for Burke, he was honest enough to acknowledge that you cannot have a no&hyphen;risk strategy&mdash;he knows that; we know that. The very fact that people move in and out of our country means that all of Australia's quarantine is, one way or another, at risk. But to suggest that we would lower the standard beyond anything that former Minister Collins had set is a scurrilous lie. We are as determined to maintain Australia's standards as you ever were and I have a personal interest in maintaining that standard to boot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact, of course&mdash;and the fact that you have chosen not to get in the way of a conveniently populist argument&mdash;is that the minister has no choice but to process this application and that is what he has done. As he has already acknowledged in his participation in the debate this afternoon, he came into office recognising that Minister Collins had not wanted to compromise Australian producers either and that Minister Collins had, in fact, delayed this application to the point at which the international court was banging on our door and putting all exports at risk. So he has no choice but to continue, as slowly as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he can, processing it. That is precisely what he has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are we supposed to apologise for merely following the course you had already set? Did I stand over there critical of you or Minister Collins when we were dealing with the pig meat exercise? Did I run this sort of populist line in spite of the number of pork producers I have in my electorate? Did I run this sort of populist line in the face of the pig meat decision? No, I did not. Why not? Because I was not prepared to be as unscrupulous as you have been with this particular MPI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the facts are that under the GATT arrangements we have no choice but to allow this to proceed. As I used to say from that desk opposite, it is high time people in the Labor Party recognised that we in the coalition facilitated the trade arrangements, frequently at great political cost. I know it because I was in opposition and the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) knows it because we both shared the anger of the citrus growers over the way we dealt, to your advantage, with the question of imported Brazilian juice and, recognising it was in the national interest, we endeavoured to support you. Here, with just a whiff of an issue that allows you to be popular, you want to run around and misrepresent all that we have been about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Burke in his MPI suggests that in some way the government has failed to give proper consideration to quarantine issues in relation to the importation of cooked chicken meat. But there is not a skerrick, not even a sniff, of evidence that we have in any way failed to give proper consideration to quarantine issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Burke, in great indignation, holds up the Senate report as if in some strange way the minister and my coalition colleagues and I are supposed to apologise for the report of the committee chaired by our colleague Senator Winston Crane. Have you heard the minister being critical of the Senate report? No. Have you heard me being critical of the Senate report? No. Have you seen us walk away from the recommendations in the Senate report? No. But you want to run that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6517"> as some sort of evidence that the minister has failed to meet his responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to where I started. I stand here as a member of the Liberal Party, proudly part of the coalition, and I stand here as a volunteer in support of the minister to undo all the nonsense you have run about some sort of division in the coalition. The coalition recognises in government, even more clearly than it did in opposition, the obligations we have under GATT to allow reasonable trading arrangements. We recognise that we are facing difficult and unpopular decisions that we cannot take anything but a responsible stance on, that we cannot take a populist stance on, and that if we fail to deliver on them we will put Australian exporting industries at risk. For that reason we have been consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not painted AQIS as an organisation that is perfect. For his entire political career, since the day he entered this parliament, the minister has stood here and been critical of AQIS. He has said that it needed to be amended, that its costs were frequently unrealistic, and that many of its work practices ought to be adjusted. But on work practices, as always, you turn a deaf ear. The minister has been entirely consistent. This MPI deserves to be tossed out of the parliament and certainly does not deserve the debating time that it has been afforded.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stand here proud to be an Independent in this debate. Australia has built a reputation around the world for the manner in which it has maintained a clean, fresh and disease free environment for its primary production. At the moment it is still a very clean supermarket to Asia, but that reputation is at grave risk, with trading imperatives distorting sound judgment on maintaining protection of our crops, and as instanced in the disaster of imported pilchards causing the spread of a virus through our native variety, and the discovery of the papaya fruit fly in southern New South Wales, identified only by a New South Wales research team now to be disbanded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The point is that our quarantine abilities are being severely challenged. Last week the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Trans port Legislation Committee said that it was not satisfied with the science that has previously cleared the importation of cooked chicken meat. There is a growing distrust of our quarantine inspection capabilities, and the answers from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in this House this afternoon did nothing to convince me that the decision to import chicken meat will be anything other than a short&hyphen;sighted level playing field, no trade barrier decision to placate our trading partners, rather than a decision based on sound scientific judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at what America does when it wants to dump some meat onto our markets. Look what it does when it wants to try to protect its motor industry. Look at Indonesia and look at Malaysia and the sort of non-tariff barriers that might be erected to distort our trading situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is particularly in the area of importing New Zealand apples and the risk of importing fire blight where I see another looming danger for my own electorate. Two reports issued in early August suggest the risk of importing New Zealand apples to Australia exceed any trading benefits. A New Zealand proposal to send apples to Australia is being reviewed by both the AQIS and the Australian Bureau of Resource Economics. ABARE estimated the spread of fire blight into Australia could cause crop losses of between 20 and 30 per cent and believes it is uncertain whether fire blight can be restricted to one region by quarantine and control measures should it arrive. Fire blight also has the potential to devastate all plants in the Roseaceae family, including roses and the thousands of ornamental berry trees that grace the central tablelands where I live and elsewhere in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the dismantling of the Rydalmere Research Station, the Carr government in New South Wales has already put at risk the research capability of that state. In fact, the ability of the New South Wales agriculture department to seriously study the effectiveness of a vaccine to counter the spread of the potentially crippling merino industry ovine johnes disease is another example of the devalued and understrengthed research capability we now have in this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6518">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee report on the importation of cooked chicken meat makes very sobering reading. The committee recommends AQIS commission tests of the thermal inactivation of the newcastle disease virus which, if imported, could not only devastate our industry but make inroads into our native fauna. The committee is reluctant to dismiss lightly concerns from scientists within the Australian chicken meat industry about some of the assumptions AQIS has made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it hard to reconcile these doubts with the minister's answer to the House this afternoon suggesting, because the previous government had allegedly cleared the scientific studies into imported chicken meat, because the process was put in train by the previous government, that the decision had effectively been made and he would find it hard to reverse the decision. The AQIS view is not infallible. It has been found wanting on other occasions. There is enough doubt over the chicken meat issue to raise serious questions about its ability to reach a sound judgment on the threat from fire blight. The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture, in a letter to AQIS in December last year claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Export of mature apples produced under New Zealand conditions will not be a viable pathway for the introduction of Erwinia Amilovora.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Yet fire blight is a serious bacterial disease in 34 countries. Why should we believe the New Zealanders who also most likely delivered us johnes disease in carpet wool sheep in the 1970s&mdash;when our quarantine was fairly impeccable, I might add? I am told submissions to AQIS on the fire blight study have been extended until the end of this month. AQIS will then prepare a draft pest risk analysis to go out to the public for comment before a final decision early in the new year at the best. Given the adherence to the trading imperatives we face, `We don't rock the boat attitudes' and the minister's acceptance of a process set in train, he says, by a former government&mdash;so I guess everything is okay&mdash;I hold real concerns for the imperatives that will determine AQIS's final recommendation. Our research and quarantine record and reputation is in danger of being sidelined for short&hyphen;term trading imperatives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we talk about level playing fields and equal access I recall that when I was minister for electricity I had a number of contracts to bring to cabinet one morning. All of them were allocated outside of the state of Queensland. I got the commissioner in and asked why there were no Queenslanders and he told me we were under an agreement with the other states to take the lowest tender. Where this is most relevant to this debate is the fact that in seven years Victoria had not allocated a single electricity contract outside the state of Victoria. So while people sign these agreements there are those out there who actively circumvent the agreements on a continuous basis. That is an important background to the decision we are talking about here today. The ALP in this place, the opposition, has come up and acted holier than thou, which is a most remarkable performance. It could only be made as an exercise in total ignorance of what has transpired up to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of North Queensland suffered a 25 per cent cut back in AQIS&mdash;so much for the crocodile tears being shed on the opposition benches today. When we complained about this and said it opens the door to the incoming of diseases to the northern part&mdash;we are the gateway for Australia&mdash;we were told by AQIS and Mr Keating's government that although the cutbacks were 25 per cent in size they would not in any way open the door to any threats to Australian agriculture or horticulture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within 18 months we had the papaya fruit fly in Far North Queensland and the cost to our industries was over $30 million per year&mdash;and we are now into our second year. Not only do I criticise the government but really I must also criticise the public servants because no matter how good or bad you are as a minister you definitely will be influenced by the public servants. As a long&hyphen;serving minister I know only too well that on a lot of occasions you have to rely on their judgment. I would urge the current Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in the strongest possible way to be very careful <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6519"> when he is relying on the judgment of these people because his predecessor, when he relied upon their judgment, was caught imposing upon Far North Queensland, upon all of our industries up there, a cost obligation of $30 million per year. So much for the crocodile tears coming from the opposition but, also, so much for the reliability and reassurances given to us by AQIS; so much for their veracity and dependability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where I come from, their standing as far as credibility is concerned is zilch. Let me just reflect upon the fact because I have, in Mareeba, a very significant chicken meat industry that services the cooked chicken meat industry of Australia. If ever there is a town which reflects what has gone wrong in this country and the decision making of the now opposition&mdash;the Keating&hyphen;Hawke government&mdash;it is the town of Mareeba. We had a TB eradication campaign introduced and that wiped out 600,000 head of cattle; it did not wipe out TB but it did succeed in getting rid of our cattle. Four hundred jobs were lost in Mareeba with the closure of the meatworks because there were no cattle to process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then had Senator Richardson, as minister, introduce world heritage which closed two timber mills. Half the main street of Mareeba is taken up with the giant timber mill that dominated the economy of the town. It was closed down and two, arguably three, other timber mills in the area were closed down, costing us 150 jobs. So that was 550 jobs. The incoming Goss Labor government in Queensland introduced an increase in water charges from around $5 up to around $30 a megalitre and that closed down the rice industry. The deregulation of the tobacco industry is another example. We removed the 50 per cent home content rule from tobacco, which was nothing to do with tobacco being dangerous to health or any of those things. At the same time the United States House of Representatives was passing legislation to increase their home content rule to up to 72 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> So much for level playing fields and so much for the hypocrisy of the now opposition. In all of these decisions we can see the reasons why they are sitting on the opposition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benches. I am talking about hypocrisy here today. We had some 12 goldmines in the Mareeba area; they introduced a gold tax which closed at least half of those goldmines and put another 50 people out of work. At the time of speaking, their Hilmer legislation is threatening the sugar industry which we are trying to get under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me back very specifically to what we are talking about today. AQIS informed us that it was very safe, that they had everything under control, that they had no problems and that the 25 per cent cutback would result in no cutback in our security against the importation of disease. That is the same thing that they are telling us with this particular legislation before us in this House today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must deal in a little more detail with the introduction of the papaya fruit fly. It has now been disclosed that they knew that the papaya fruit fly was in the Torres Strait three years before the outbreak in Far North Queensland. Even though they knew the papaya fruit fly was in the Torres Strait three years before, they introduced no quarantine restrictions upon the Torres Strait islands whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the information of the House, it is extremely easy to quarantine the Torres Strait because there is only one crossing of the Jardine River. All you have to do is pay the ferryman and you have got yourself a quarantine service. You already have six full-time officials operating on Thursday Island who can police the airport. So it was very easy to protect us. AQIS knew that the papaya fruit fly was there, yet they did absolutely nothing to quarantine the Torres Strait. The net result was the loss of $30 million a year to the economy of Far North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me move specifically to this decision. I say to the minister: please understand that this town is reeling. Blow after blow has been delivered by the previous government. I do not want to see another blow delivered to the economy of Mareeba.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the Senate estimates hearings&mdash;and I will quote from five pages. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I deeply regret that you could not stay on for your own meeting that you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6520"> called. The AQIS representative in a fairly high&hyphen;handed manner, I might add, told all of us that the research on this had been done over a long period. I asked whether this was done before this time last year and she said, `Yes, all of it was done before this time last year.' I said, `Fine. You came to this parliament and you told us that this is quite a safe decision,' yet I am holding here the quotes from the hearings of the Senate. Senator O'Chee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are you aware of a letter that Mr Alexander wrote to Mr Peter Board on 9 February 1993, in response to Mr Board's earlier correspondence advising that AQIS was reviewing Australia's prohibition of importation of chicken meat and chicken meat products on the basis of the use of at least one of five time temperature treatments? I ask whether you are aware that, in his response, Mr Alexander said&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the important point for this House and this is the authority upon which AQIS has made all of these recommendations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must admit when we did that work I did not expect it to have such ramifications.</PARA>
<PARA>That means allowing the importation of cooked chicken meat into Australia. Senator O'Chee goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me quote the letter. I will happily give you a copy. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would say that the heat inactivation of any organism is dependent on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The organism&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that was whether it was a high pathogenic level organism or not&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The medium in which the organism is treated and its thermal properties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The temperature applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The length of time the heat process is applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The heat inactivation curves that we produced give a guide to the rate at which inactivation of the strain of infectious bursal disease virus used takes place within the specified parameters. Thus the greater the initial number of virus particles present the longer it will take (if the other parameters remain constant) to reach required low probability of survival of infectivity that is selected as the required level of confidence.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not going to read all five pages here, but it probably does behove me to read one other quotation from Senator O'Chee. He said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you are aware of the fact that if you have different concentrations of the organism then you will require longer time temperature cooking to reach a level at which you can say there is a low probability of effective survival . . . but you do not actually have, across the whole range of meat product, a particular time temperature limit at which you can guarantee no effective survival.</PARA>
<PARA>AQIS came forward to the meeting that I attended and told us all that it was 100 per cent safe, yet they are holding a letter from their own expert saying that there are three areas that need to be tested&mdash;one is the heat, one is the time that you apply the heat for and one is the pathogen level and the type of pathogen strain that you are dealing with. The third parameter has not been tested. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate's amendment be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment, the piece of work that we seek to include in the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, is very short. The purpose of it is to allow persons other than officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, which has been recently discussed in this House, to be appointed as authorised officers under the Imported Food Control Act 1992 with all the powers of an authorised officer other than specified enforcement powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment is sought by the government as a result of concerns raised by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills regarding the unlimited nature of the enforcement powers which would flow to persons authorised under the Imported Food Control Act 1992. As a result of the amendment, AQIS anticipates a more effective and efficient service to industry as it not only minimises the duplication of inspection service activities but also provides a more flexible approach to inspection service delivery in locations where an AQIS officer is not readily available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importing industry has been consulted at length and strongly supports the amendment. In essence, it is about delivering to the importing community a more flexible inspection system of the sort that we are very vigorously engaged in supplying to the exporting community. In the vast majority of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> circumstances, inspections are, and will continue to be, carried out in the major port facilities as this is where the bulk of imported food products enter the country. But there are occasions when inspections need to be carried out in more remote locations and the services of an AQIS officer are not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have been concerned that this may amount to import facilitation, but it is not really quite so much that as facilitating those who use imported product. For example, the dairy industry and other food processing companies often import some product or some part of the materials that they use in their food processing on a seasonal&hyphen;basis need and are able to inspect it at the local level and in the regions. They often cannot find an AQIS officer readily available and, when they bring one in, they find that it is very expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under those circumstances, it seems more than appropriate&mdash;indeed, very sensible&mdash;to ensure that people such as local health inspectors or other suitably qualified people can provide basic service delivery in this regard. Therefore, we do endorse the approach.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the adjournment last night, I was relating to the House correspondence which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) received from a Ms Gilda Villani of Pascoe Vale concerning the child&hyphen;care decisions being made by the government in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill. Ms Villani states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is your strategy in assisting the middle and lower class workforce, (particularly working mothers) by forcing them out of employment and back into the kitchen . . . this mentality of yours is well out of date.</PARA>
<PARA>It certainly is. She goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wake up Mr. Costello and listen to our genuine concerns, we are saying we want to be able to afford quality care for our children, we did not ask you to make it a luxury. More importantly you must retain <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Subsidised Community Based Child Care Centres</EMPHASIS>  that don't put profits before the quality care of children . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think they are very important points. The letter is signed by Ms Gilda Villani, who signs herself off as `one of many thousands of angry working mothers'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, this bill represents yet another government broken election promise. If we go back to the pre-election period, the government made a commitment to retain&mdash;I guess that must have been a non&hyphen;core commitment&mdash;the non&hyphen;means tested child&hyphen;care cash rebate and the system of child&hyphen;care assistance. But what we see now is the abolition of operational subsidies for community based long day care centres, the government will not provide capital funding to build the promised 5,500 new long day care places, it is restricting eligibility for child&hyphen;care assistance and it is applying a means test to the child&hyphen;care cash rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Once again, we have seen a Labor government acting as the enlargers, expanding child care from 46,000 places&mdash;a derisory 46,000 places&mdash;to 270,000 places, just as we expand ed tertiary education places massively, just as we expanded secondary education from one-third of all children completing secondary education to better than two-thirds, just as we expanded health insurance to those two million people who were uninsured who were without health insurance when we came to government, just as we expanded superannuation from a narrow elite to encompass the overwhelming majority of Australian workers, just as we expanded jobs with our job creation programs. We created some 700,000 new jobs in our final term of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all those areas Labor were the enlargers. In all these areas we have seen a coalition government come in and put a stop to it. Once again, we are seeing this legislation putting a stop to the growth in child&hyphen;care assistance, putting a stop to child care being affordable and accessible in the way it should be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this place to draw to the attention of the House again the fact that I am proud to represent within the electorate of Isaacs the suburb of Cranbourne&mdash;perhaps the child&hyphen;care capital of Australia. I submit that because it was at Cranbourne that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) launched the coalition's child&hyphen;care policy&mdash;perhaps best described as its ill-fated child&hyphen;care policy&mdash;during the election campaign in March. We can all well recall pictures flashed across the newspapers of the country of the Prime Minister seated at a child's tea set enjoying a tea party with a young child&hyphen;care beneficiary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to begin my contribution by referring briefly to an editorial of 15 August from the main weekly newspaper of the Cranbourne area, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cranbourne Sun</EMPHASIS>. This editorial, which dealt with the looming crisis in child care resulting from the federal government's changes in this area, had this to say about the government's changes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision of child care services is an unquestioned government responsibility in most industrialised countries.</PARA>
<PARA>When an editorial of nothing more than a News Ltd newspaper accepts the vital role played by government in ensuring the provi <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6524"> sion of quality long-term day care to children of a particular area then I think it is fair to say that those who hold the view that the government ought not be playing such a role are well and truly in the minority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) has so lucidly pointed out, the Labor Party takes great pride in the fact that as a government we had established a system of high quality, affordable child care that was the envy of the rest of the world. In fact, the introduction of such a service was largely driven by the recognition of the fact that there was an increasingly large number of women in our society who wished, as I will allude to a little later on, to pursue working careers, and without adequate child care many women would be denied this fundamental right, this basic opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, as the member for Wills has succinctly drawn to the attention of the House, child care and the use of that facility in Australia has grown to such an extent that there are currently over half a million children in Australia enjoying the benefits of Commonwealth funded child care. The government justifies these changes to the child&hyphen;care system, such as this bill's abolition of the operational subsidy for community based long day care, by claiming that this initiative shall encourage services to be more efficient and more cost competitive with the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the thinking that is identified by the fundamental flaw of, as we see in so many other pieces of legislation before this House, the government again failing to recognise the value of child care. In this instance, the government recognises the price of everything but the value of nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's thinking is that the private sector can and ought to provide child&hyphen;care services: let us save a few bucks and leave it to the private sector. Those of us on this side of the House have no objection to the role of the private sector in child care. In fact, it was under the last Labor government that the operation of private child&hyphen;care providers absolutely flourished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side also accept the notion that there is a direct role for government to play. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Long day care is an excellent example of where this should occur. For instance, compared with the private sector, government subsidised community based long day care provides services for children with special needs, more places for babies and extended hours that are, in many instances, beyond the range of the hours provided by private sector based child&hyphen;care operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to the month or so prior to March of this year to remind those present in the House of the Prime Minister's often touted election slogan: for all of us. We on this side have come to realise that `for all of us', when defined in practice, falls a long way short of the people who need to be brought up to the standards enjoyed by many Australians, those people Labor never left behind and whom this government is seeking again to leave behind. Of course, I am talking about the children of this nation who will be denied access now to proper child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill makes clear the government's priority when it does turn to families; that is, those in which one partner is at home caring for children. It is not those families in which both parents are working. The government, in this legislation, is clearly saying to the over 50 per cent of women who are working these days, `Don't work or we'll penalise you. We'll take away your right. We'll take away the opportunity Labor afforded you to gain access to community day care for your children.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of this operational child&hyphen;care subsidy is yet another broken promise from a government that promised to set a new standard in propriety. It has demonstrated, through its failure to keep its word or act with some integrity, on too many occasions of late a new low standard that will draw forth the scorn of all Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6525"> I note what the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) said with regard to community based long day care centres in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of August of this year. She said that she `can't give a guarantee they won't close because it will depend on how the management structure operates'. This is despite the government trumpeting the $8.3 million that they are providing to help com munity based centres manage the loss of operational subsidies. Like many of its apparent acts of giving, this is another case of the government giving with one hand and taking back with the other. In this case it is taking a lot more back&mdash;$118 million&mdash;with that other hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Chief Executive of the Municipal Association of Victoria, Mr Robert Barnes, has claimed that `the loss of operational subsidies will mean rises in council&hyphen;run child care taking funds from elsewhere or closing centres'. Having taken away this $118 million from community based day care, it is not likely that councils&mdash;councils such as the City of Kingston within my own electorate of Isaacs, which will lose $120,000 in funding for its four child&hyphen;care centres&mdash;will be able to come up with replacement funding. There is no way the costs to parents will not rise unless&mdash;I suspect that Kingston may well do this&mdash;the quality of child&hyphen;care services provided is reduced. To quote another person knowledgeable in the area of child care, Frances Wright of the Victorian Subsidised Child Care Coordinators Association:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once again, it's those who can least afford it who will suffer the most.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an emerging trend now with this government: those who can least afford it are those that are hit the hardest. Another angle that this government, which claims to represent small business and the battlers, has overlooked is the impact these changes to child care will have on more women being forced to leave work. An August editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cranbourne News</EMPHASIS> &mdash;Cranbourne is an area which has a high proportion of families where both parents work to make ends meet&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prohibitive costs will also force some parents out of the workforce as well as the child care system, with ramifications for local economies. Those families will have reduced incomes and less to spend.</PARA>
<PARA>The alternatives to fee increases for child&hyphen;care centres are quite alarming. First, they could cease to provide cooked meals for the children. Secondly, they could be forced to reduce, or even cease providing, care for children in the under&hyphen;two age group. Thirdly, they could reduce the numbers of staff or the hours of those staff. Fourthly, they could have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to re&hyphen;evaluate the after&hyphen;school program and incorporate these children into the long day care program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that this is not the last we will hear of the government and its tampering within the child&hyphen;care area. We have the recommendations of the EPAC child care task force, which has been looking into this area. We expect to be back here at some time in the near future, fighting in the interests of all Australian families to save what is left of our once great system. I commend the amendment proposed by the shadow minister to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) reminded me in his speech of the famous tea party scene where the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), then Leader of the Opposition, was seen in the sandpit with children in a day care centre. That image, while somewhat  embarrassing at the time, is seen as transparently hypocritical in light of the policies this government has pursued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thrust of this Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill is to discontinue payments of operational subsidies to community based long day care centres from 1 July 1997. The impact of the bill is shown in the financial impact statement contained in the bill's explanatory memorandum. The bill says it will achieve net savings of $118.4 million over the first four years. Because they are net amounts, which otherwise would have been contributed by the government, they have to be made up out of the pockets of parents. Because they come out of the pockets of parents, they are a gross figure. So, effectively, that is $220 million coming from the parents of children in community based long day care centres if they want to, or are able to, maintain current standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt on any objective analysis that it has been the community based day care centres which have been the innovators and the developers of the first&hyphen;class facilities. This is in comparison to a number of centres which have failed or are yet to pass the accreditation standards. By far, the majority of those which have passed the accreditation standards are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6526"> the community based centres. They are the centres of quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of the community based centres are that they enable minority groups, which include, quite frequently, children with special needs, to have access to the centres. Not only are those children with special needs children from poor families, they also include children who lack English skills and indeed, quite frequently, children with disabilities. The operational subsidies have meant, quite literally, that those first&hyphen;class services have been affordable and accessible to the total spectrum of those in our community requiring community based day care facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite simply poor government to abdicate the field of quality child care to private interests, as this government is well down the track of doing. As one commentator said, `We don't dump kids in a school system that we don't regulate and don't fund,' and it is absolutely no different in terms of the crucial preschool age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is already a black economy in child care which follows on from the United States example where so many child-care centres, if you can call them that, are regarded as `child warehouses', where parents literally dump the kids off at the door of these child warehouses just as someone might dump a pet off at a local kennel before they go on holidays. They do not particularly want to look inside because they do not want to be distressed when they are away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, that is going to be the sort of scenario facing a great many parents who will have to put their kids into substandard child-care facilities as a result of the funds being taken out of the child-care system. I do not want to see any child developed in these crucial years in a warehouse environment, yet that is what this government is driving towards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thrust of the government is one which is predicated upon failure to recognise the legitimate entitlement of women; and it is one so frequently revealed, when one scratches the surface of the government's rhetoric, in flashes from the internal soul or the internal conscience of the government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), in his speech on this topic, regarded the child-care sector in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the child&hyphen;care industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>By the way, community based centres are not an industry; they are community based caring centres. They are not profit driven. But they were his terms. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the child&hyphen;care industry has grown in response partly to demand but more so because the government policies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring to the Labor government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we have experienced in recent years have driven it. It was seen by the former government as a politically correct cause. It was seen as an opportunity to win votes by pandering to the extreme feminist agenda . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have met a number of very fine people, both men and women, who are active in community based child-care centres. On their behalf, I strongly resent any reference to an unbalanced or misconstrued view of life or any simple insult implied by referring to them as being driven by a feminist agenda. They are concerned fundamentally with the proper upbringing of children at a very crucial age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, in the St George region just outside my electorate, we have a centre for children with learning disabilities. The convener at that centre, Ms Maria Cook, has written to the Prime Minister. She said in her letter to the Prime Minister that, if you do not provide adequate care and if you do not properly train teachers at this level, it will result in kids with disabilities being undetected and you are not going to be able to apply the right treatment and help where it is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Cook has referred to United States examples where research shows that the cost of not treating, or not addressing, learning disabilities is multiplied many times in order to address the problems confronted by those children later in life. Regrettably, those problems are also quite often confronted by society later in life as a result of those learning disabilities possibly manifesting themselves in such things as criminal conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, Tracy Popple, the director of the Kogarah Uniting Church long day care centre, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6527"> has written to me. She has referred to the fact that much of her patronage is from migrant families. She has referred to the fact that 25 per cent of families in her centre are eligible for the maximum child&hyphen;care assistance, which requires a total family income of less than $476 per week. She has indicated that the additional fee of $25 per week will clearly be something those families will not be able to afford. Many will be driven from the quality system of community based day care into the private industry, but those parents will be able to afford only very low quality day care at the bottom end of the private scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) today in answer to a question from one of his colleagues referred to illiteracy in the community. He announced that the government had the intention of addressing illiteracy, despite the fact that clearly the initial program is one developed by the Labor government. Be that as it may, there is absolutely no use treating the symptom if you do not treat the cause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He acknowledged, in fairness to him, the importance of addressing the illiteracy problem at primary school age but, as Maria Cook quite rightly points out, up to one in five children have learning disabilities. The time to detect, the time to address, those problems is at preschool. The government's claim that it is interested in addressing illiteracy will come to naught if it does not and is not addressing the problem at the very earliest opportunity&mdash;that is, in these vital preschool years. The government is taking away the resource base of the community based centres. It is taking away the talent base from the community based centres. It is driving away parents who need the resources of the community based centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's hollow rhetoric comes to nothing. Their actions with respect to this issue in particular are contemptible. Far from being motivated by a feminist agenda, the opposition is motivated by very committed and concerned parents. The government, ultimately, is going to pay a very heavy price for the policies they are pursuing. I strongly oppose the government's bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like all of us on this side of the parliament, I speak in absolute opposition to the proposition which this uncaring government has brought before the people of Australia today. The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is nothing but philosophically driven claptrap. To suggest that people in this day and age, particularly women, should be denied access to affordable child care is akin to suggesting to people they have no legitimate right to take a role in the work force if they are women, that they have no legitimate right to seek some opportunities for respite care for their kids or that this might be some sort of a rort to the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the words that I used there are the sorts of words we hear time and time again from this government. This government says, `If you have used some R&amp;D grants in the past, it's a rort now and we're going to cut those out. If in some way you have access to concessions to promote tourism overseas, it's a rort and we're going to cut that back.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of child care, they are suggesting that, because they believe saving $118.4 million over three years is an appropriate way to attack child care, they are going to put in place this legislation. This legislation will, firstly, discontinue the operational subsidy to community based long day care centres to take effect from 1 July next year and, secondly, amend the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 to reduce the child&hyphen;care cash rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for families with a taxable income in the current year lower than the family income cut&hyphen;off for part A of the family tax initiative, which is currently $70,000 per annum for a family with one child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the basis of this government's attack on child care. Yet you have to wonder whether the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or any of these ministers on the other side who are part of this government have actually ever been to a long day care centre or have ever been to a community based child-care centre. Have they ever been there and spoken to the people who use the facility?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They sit here in this parliament, point the finger at us and say, `The Labor Party is out <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6528"> of touch.' They say that the Labor Party has forgotten what the average, ordinary battlers of Australia want. I can tell you: the average, ordinary battlers of Wollongong&mdash;the average, ordinary battlers of the Illawarra&mdash;who utilise child&hyphen;care facilities have long memories. They have very, very long memories. This issue, which is raging in Illawarra, will come back at some stage in the future and bite this government where it hurts most. It is incredible to think that in some way opportunities should be denied people to access community based child-care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are non-profit organisations. These are organisations that often are run by the local councils or by community groups. In the case of the Illawarra, the Illawarra Children's Services Action Group runs a number of these. You have the Bulli Children's Centre. You have a range of others&mdash;at Corrimal, the Western Suburbs Child Care Centre. They are all generally under the auspices of the Wollongong City Council, the Illawarra Children's Services Action Group or some other organisation that is community based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You ask the mothers, the trained staff at these child&hyphen;care centres, and the fathers as well: why do you put your kids in child care? All sorts of reasons come out. They tell you, for example, `I happen to be a single mother because I am divorced, and I need the opportunity to have my children looked after in child care occasionally so that I can go to university, so I can improve myself, so I can get a better job in the work force to look after my family.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You hear of two-income families who are at the lower end of the scale&mdash;two incomes are a necessity for some of these people. They put their kids in child care not only because they want an opportunity for them to mix with children of their own age but also because it is actually an economic necessity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You ask people why their children are in child care, and they will tell you it is because they believe that their children get an enormous socialisation experience, they mix with kids of their own age, they relate to one another and it is part of their social development. Yet those on the other side of this chamber think that that is all nonsense. In <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hard dollars and cents facts, they say, `We are going to slash into child care.' Hang the consequences. Do not worry about what the people want. Do not worry about the fact that these people, over a long period of time, have come to believe that child care is a right in our society and have looked to governments&mdash;particularly federal governments; Labor governments&mdash;to sustain that belief. We certainly did that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to remind the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of his commitment when in opposition to continue adequate, affordable, available child-care facilities for Australian families. Child care has become a lucrative thriving business in Australia. The majority of the cost, 60 per cent or $1.5 billion, is met by governments. Of this, in 1995-96, $1.1 billion was Commonwealth government funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1983 there were 46,000 Commonwealth supported child-care places. The number of Commonwealth assisted places already exceeds the target of 300,000 set for June 1997 and further expansion is expected. This <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6530"> expansion is under severe threat thanks to proposed budget cuts. Thanks to these cuts, the creation of additional places to meet the ever increasing demand for child care is unlikely. What of the commitment to the continuation of adequate, affordable, available child-care facilities for Australian families?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community based long day care centres are non-profit centres. Centres in my electorate are normally administered by a committee made up of parents and other members of the community. This is of great benefit for all those involved&mdash;the children, the parents, the community and the centre. The big plus is, I believe, the ability of a centre run this way to be more responsive to the needs of those involved. The provision of the opportunity for parents to be so involved in decisions affecting the care of their children is of great comfort. Let us face it: most parents would prefer their children to be cared for in the home. It is a sad indictment of our society that these days, if a family wants to get ahead, it is often necessary for both mother and father to go out to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Operational subsidies are targeted for removal from 1 July 1997 for community based long day care centres. This subsidy is paid by the government to these centres which are owned and operated by the community on a non-profit basis. Many of these centres in my electorate of Oxley have operated for more than 20 years. Subsidies have given these community based organisations the financial help they have needed to continue to provide a service for the thousands of children who attend them. The continued viability of these centres is questionable if the removal of the operational subsidy goes ahead. Without the subsidy, some families will have to find at least another $15 to $20 a week for child care. To many Australian families who are already battling to find the money to pay the bills, this will be the last straw.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Operational subsidies cost the government $137 million in the 1995-96 budget. This was paid to the community based long day care centres and family day care centres. Under the present proposal, long day care centres will lose their subsidy as of 1 July 1997. Unfortu nately, this loss will mean that the price of care will have to increase by the amount of the subsidy withdrawn. This could ultimately bring about the closure of some centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This operational subsidy was introduced to encourage the provision of quality child care in those areas shunned by the private child-care sector. Why? Because these operators prefer to set up centres only in economically viable areas. Operational subsidies received by the long day care community centres help to offset the expense of operating in rural and remote areas. Operational subsidies mean that long day care centres can offer a high standard of quality care to children who because of their age&mdash;many of them are under two years&mdash;need special care and attention. This care and attention is simply not provided by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of this operational subsidy will mean that the supply of quality, affordable child care will gradually become a thing of the past and that low income earners will be forced into accepting substandard child care. In some cases, they will simply give up. The loss of this subsidy could see a reduction in the quality of child care overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child-care assistance is another subsidy paid by the government to aid low income families. This subsidy cost the government $745 million in 1995-96 and will cost $850 million in 1996-97. This subsidy is also available to sole non-working parents for up to 50 hours per week. The government will pay a maximum subsidy of 84 per cent for one child and 91 per cent for two dependent children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I consider this proposal, which allows for 50 hours support per week for non-working sole parents, a slap in the face for the married parent who, I am sure, would also dearly love to have 84 per cent of their child-care expenses paid for by the taxpayer. I have no objection to single mothers having 50 hours of child-care support provided they are in full-time employment. I believe it is counterproductive to be providing support and encouragement to those who are not in employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Being a single mum, I can appreciate being able to have a break from your children, but 50 hours a week is only releasing sole non- <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6531">working parents from their responsibilities to care for their own children by allowing them to leave their children in child care at the expense of the taxpayer. People will argue that they may need the time to search for work or to attend training programs. Even so, the average working week is 40 hours. Isn't it in the child's best interest to be with the parent, especially when they are under school age?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provide care by all means, but 12 hours per week for non-working sole parents is enough of a burden on the taxpayer. The saving from this would enable the government to retain operational subsidy to long day care centres. This would benefit the community, employment and those parents who are trying to keep their heads above water. It would also mean that in some cases working mums would not be forced into a situation where they will have to give up their jobs and get back on to the social security roundabout.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child&hyphen;care assistance and the child&hyphen;care cash rebate will be paid by a new Commonwealth service delivery agency from 1 January 1998. At that time families will be given the choice of receiving their child&hyphen;care payments directly or having them paid to their approved child&hyphen;care service. Parents and providers will benefit from a streamlined system involving one agency and a significant reduction in red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After speaking to a large number of long day care and family day care providers&mdash;the people who deal in the industry daily&mdash;it is obvious that they are appalled by the government's proposal to pay parents directly. This, I believe, will leave the door wide open for the system to be abused and some parents using the money for purposes other than intended. Thus, children will not be receiving the child&hyphen;care services, employment will suffer and the taxpayer, again, will be taken for a ride.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cannot afford to shirk its responsibilities to the taxpayer by passing the buck and saying that it is cutting red tape. We must be fair when making decisions. How can the child&hyphen;care proposal in its present form be considered fair when, again, the average Australian battlers will be the hardest hit?</PARA>

But, where they spend time in organisations that are directly under the province of government, we have a responsibility to provide a high quality service. This also provides an important opportunity to raise the level of awareness amongst the broader community about high quality child care and raises the acceptable standards of the entire community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me this is one of the most important imperatives for continuing the operational funding to community based centres. In many areas these organisations are the flagships of quality by which parents can have a benchmark to judge the service they receive. Many parents are also in areas where private providers are few and far between because the economic base or the geographic spread of the population makes private centres less financially viable. It is a great shame that the current government, as part of its first budget, has also cut thousands of places that were planned for new growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 abolishes the operational subsidy for community based long day care centres. I have seen many spurious arguments put forth to justify what is in reality a simple but punishing cost saving. This policy stems directly from the National Commission of Audit and its ideologically driven commitment to the fairytale of competitive neutrality in the child&hyphen;care sector. The rhetoric of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6532"> report is chilling in its treatment of this service in its oversimplified and short&hyphen;sighted consumer/provider terminology</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quoting directly from the report on this matter, we can see the complete lack of comprehension of quality issues expressed and the sheer leaps in logic that this report presents as some form of unchallengeable truth. On this issue, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Operational subsidies to publicly funded child&hyphen;care centres result in distortion in the public and private sector supply markets for child care. Achievement of competitive neutrality between publicly funded and private sector suppliers is desirable and will also improve equity in relation to the fees faced by parents using suppliers in either sector.</PARA>
<PARA>I would personally like to see any of the government members spouting that garbage to a delegation of concerned parents&mdash;I have had many concerned parents coming to see me not just here but in my electorate office&mdash;and teachers from their local community based long day care centre. I am sure the reception would clearly dispel these myths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more insidious, however, is the complete lack of discussion in this document about the way in which changes to funding processes will impact on the quality of the service. I would therefore now like to look a little more closely at the forced options being faced by the community based long day care centres in my own electorate of Throsby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received direct representation on this issue by several members of the community based centres in my area, including the South Coast Workers Child Care Centre, the Western Suburbs Child Care Centre, the Wallaroo Child Care Centre, the Warilla Child Care Centre, which is run by the local council, and Illawarra Area Child Care Ltd, which is a not for profit, community based umbrella organisation which sponsors and assists the management of six children's services in the Illawarra, including four, 40 place long day care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also attended a public meeting on this issue at the Wollongong Town Hall on Thursday, 12 September. At all times it has been made quite clear to me that this proposal is putting before these organisations a decision where they are directly facing the choice <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> between significantly increasing costs to parents or significantly decreasing the quality of the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The South Coast Workers Child Care Centre face a loss of $30,670 in 1997 and $61,341 per year after that. They have indicated that they will not be choosing to compromise quality and so will have to pass on the additional cost to parents. The same situation arises at many other centres. All centres are indicating that they cannot trade off quality for decreased service fees. They are extremely concerned that this will push many families who are just able to meet their current child&hyphen;care costs out of the system and into unregulated and even backyard services. The impact on families is dramatic. One constituent wrote to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not a political person. I am a single parent defending my pre&hyphen;schooler's right to quality, affordable child care. My child has been attending the Wallaroo Community based long day care centre full&hyphen;time while I have been temporarily employed and training in an effort to become self&hyphen;sufficient and no longer require Social Security payments. Under proposed budget cuts, Wallaroo will lose its operational subsidy and be forced to find other means to replace this money. I was recently informed that my fees may increase by twenty&hyphen;five dollars per week or otherwise the level and quality of service will have to be drastically re&hyphen;organised. This means reducing the number of qualified staff, purchasing less equipment for the children, possibly cancelling places for children under the age of 2 years and no longer providing hot meals. I am already struggling financially and can see no alternative other than to keep my son at home and give up any hopes of becoming independent.</PARA>
<PARA>This letter is typical of the issues parents and centres are struggling with in their concern that the cuts will be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are everyday people. They may well not be political people, but they have seen an excellent service&mdash;run by the local community, delivering a needed and quality service to them and, most importantly to many of them, to their children&mdash;being beaten up by this government. These people can see no reason for this action other than cost cutting. If there is one area where people will not tolerate cost&hyphen;cutting measures it is in the area of services provided to their children. These organisations are not protesting this decision <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6533"> because it eats away at their profit margin or weakens their investment potential. These are organisations run by dedicated members of communities who have put many years into building a service which their local community can be proud of and which ensures a benchmark standard of excellence. The people protesting these measures are adamant in their commitment to quality and will not trade it off for savings. They are insulted by the government sop of offering money to undertake efficiency reviews to make the organisations more financially effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Choice in child care for parents should not revolve simply around the purchasing power of the dollar. It is not good enough to say that if you want to spend more you can buy better quality when it comes to the critical years our children spend in preschool facilities. Real choice relies on an educated population who understand the balance of quality and price issues effectively enough to allow them to make informed choices with their money. Community based and government subsidised child&hyphen;care services have provided the measuring stick for many parents in this field. At the end of the day they may choose not to use a community based centre but, as part of the real choice, they should have that option to consider. What happens in reality is that those centres hold excellent reputations in their local communities and are so in demand that many parents who would use them by choice are not able to get places in them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an obvious statement to say that an under two&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child requires far more supervision than older children. This means a far higher staff to child ratio and therefore significantly increases the costs to the provider. It is no coincidence that this is an area with a huge unmet demand problem already. In my own electorate of Throsby, only 25 per cent of the current private centres provide any positions for under two&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. Children with disabilities and children at risk particularly need the option of a quality fully resourced centre to provide for their needs. The families of these children are often already faced with significant out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses to meet the child's needs and should not have to face personally providing extra <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> funds to the child&hyphen;care centre to resource a place for their child. The interaction provided is important for the growth of that child and ensures that other children are able to develop the compassion and understanding that we all should have for children in this situation. If this type of cost cutting forces those parents to take their children back into the home, then we have moved a long way backwards in our recognition of the dignity and rights of children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to comment on the other proposals which change the eligibility and administration of the child&hyphen;care cash rebate. This scheme was put into place by the Labor government in July 1994. It was the first formal recognition that child care constitutes an essential expense incurred in earning an income. It provided some assistance to working families not benefiting from targeted child&hyphen;care assistance and some further assistance to those in receipt of child&hyphen;care assistance. Most significantly, the rebate was not income tested because it was already a direct recognition of the cost of child care as a legitimate work related expense. It was administered as a direct rebate rather than as a tax concession because this allocation is to be paid to families not in direct income&hyphen;earning situations, such as those studying, training or, indeed, seeking work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Means testing the child&hyphen;care rebate is therefore a direct contradiction of the purpose of the rebate in the first place, and it is a clear broken promise by the current government. Over the last decade, we have developed a child&hyphen;care system in Australia that is of world standard. Much of this achievement has been based on the funding of a system that has ensured quality and equity. To attack this now is short&hyphen;sighted and self&hyphen;defeating penny&hyphen;pinching which can only negate results for all the interested parties. Not least of all, the children will be directly affected. I totally oppose what the government is proposing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the measures in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 that will abolish the operational subsidy for community based long day care centres in my electorate of Corio. There are eight community based <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6534"> child&hyphen;care centres operated by the City of Greater Geelong and parents who use those facilities will have their child&hyphen;care costs dramatically increased as a result of John Howard's budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition made a very explicit promise to the people of Australia before the election. The promise was contained in a letter written to the Australian Early Childhood Association by the then shadow minister for employment, training and family services, David Kemp. Dr Kemp had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition policy also states our continuing support for the community based long day care sector and we regard the operational subsidy as one of the key supports of that sector.</PARA>
<PARA>And listen to this, Mr Deputy Speaker:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition has no plans whatever to change the operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet here we are barely seven months after the Liberal and National parties won government and they are violating a key promise to many working families and putting affordable, quality child care out of their reach. It is not the only promise they have broken. In aged care, health care, education and jobs, this government&mdash;barely seven months in office&mdash;has one of the most appalling records of any postwar government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In removing the operational subsidy from community based child&hyphen;care centres, the Howard government has taken a further step towards the Americanisation of child care&mdash;a system regarded as one of the worst in the world because of its high costs, poor standards, low wages and unequal access. The members of the coalition have no appreciation of the high quality of child care provided by community based long day care centres. These centres provide more places for children with special needs and provide extended opening hours for working parents. They are staffed by a highly dedicated and qualified staff and cater for small babies as well as older children. It is these centres that will be hit by increased costs with the removal of this operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently visited several community based long day care centres in my electorate to assess first&hyphen;hand the potential impact of these changes on the working parents who use those <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> centres. At the Corio Day Care Centre, a dedicated staff of 12 people cater for 60 children coming from 100 families, most of whom are working parents. In allocating access at the centre, priority is given to children of working parents and families with special needs and, of course, single parents studying to improve their economic situation and future opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fees at these centres have recently increased due to the local council's competitive tendering process. The removal of the Commonwealth's operating subsidy will mean the centre will lose $65,000 in income out of a total operating budget of $488,000. Given that cutting costs further is not an option for the centre, as the centre is already trying to cope with constraints on its funding from local government sources, the  only alternative it will have will be to increase fees to parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar situation occurs at the Rosewall Child Care Centre, which I also visited recently. This small centre caters for 25 children at a time, is used by around 40 families and is staffed by four extremely dedicated people. The removal of the operational subsidy will simply mean that the centre's fees will have to increase, to the disadvantage of those working families and single parents who currently use it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the bad news doesn't end there. From April next year, a means test will apply to the child&hyphen;care centre rebate, leading to further effective cost increases for working families. Add in further normal cost increases that flow from local government sources and I can quite believe the figures presented to this House earlier in this debate by the member for Fremantle, Dr Lawrence, who in quoting the financial effects on her constituents provided estimates of fee increases of between 40 and 50 per cent for a single parent with two children in full&hyphen;time care. These measures represent a half a billion dollar grab from working families, and the government ought to be ashamed of it and condemned for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently had a very distressed mother contact me about the impact of increased fees on her own family situation. She has four children, three of school age who require <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6535"> specialised medical attention for physical problems. That constitutes quite a financial drain on the family budget and requires considerable transportation to receive the required medical and educational attention. She relies heavily on community day care facilities to assist in the minding of her four&hyphen;year&hyphen;old while she and her husband seek out the required medical attention for their other children. She has informed me that she faces fee rises of $38 per week, and the family simply cannot afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I wish to make in this debate is that, when you strip the rhetoric of this budget away and examine the financial impact and direction of many of these government proposals, it is clear that the intent of John Howard's family taxation package, combined with these child-care measures, is to simply drive some of the working women out of the work force back into the home. That is despite the fact that there are women who must, of necessity, work to supplement the inadequate wages received by males in the household.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian society over the past three decades has changed dramatically, and so has the role of women in that society. The increased participation of women in the work force has been driven in some cases by the increases in educational opportunities for women, which has legitimately raised their own personal expectations of taking fuller advantages of expanded life choices. For many other women, sheer economic necessity has propelled them to enter the work force to put food on the table, to pay off the home mortgage, and to educate their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some key statistics bear out the degree to which women currently participate in the work force. The ABS family national summary of 1996 showed that, in 1985, 45.5 per cent of couples with dependants were both employed. By 1995 this had grown to 57 per cent. Between 1980 and 1995, the labour force participation rate for females increased by nine per cent, from 44.8 to 53.8 per cent. Of course, there are those in the community who bemoan these developments, who seek to deny women the opportunity to work, and who seek to turn the clock back. I am afraid <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is one of those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was intrigued to read some very interesting material recently outlining the economic benefits to enterprises of people returning to the work force or, conversely, the cost to enterprises when they lost experienced employees. The Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment has estimated labour turnover costs at between 50 and 130 per cent of the past incumbent's salary. In the car industry in 1990 it was estimated it cost $850 per car for each unwanted staff turnover in a 4,000 person factory. I mention this point because there are many women employed in the car industry in my electorate. In the finance sector it was estimated that losing an employee with eight years experience cost $80,000. I mention these examples because there are many in our community who would deny the efficiency gains and the overall economic benefits to enterprises and the nation of an expanded work force with high levels of female participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, let me point out the reality of what these child-care fee increases mean in community based long day care centres. It will mean that many working parents will simply drop out of employment. The important tasks performed by these centres in monitoring children at risk will itself be at risk. The quiet community setting where parents can talk with professionals about their children and get good advice may in the long term be closed off to those parents. For single mothers who do not have family or neighbourhood support, these fee increases will put even one day's care to give these deserving mothers a break from their children out of the reach of many of those single mothers. The simple question will be asked by many women from low income families, `What is the point of me going to work?' and they will simply drop out of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation represents yet another appalling breach of John Howard's pre-election commitments. He has clearly demonstrated that he is a Prime Minister not to be trusted.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be speaking on the Child Care <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6536"> Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. Prior to entering parliament I can recall many discussions about child care. There used to be a view that child care was a women's issue. I have never actually seen child care as being a women's issue; I think it is really a family issue. The availability or non-availability of child care certainly affects women most particularly. When considering this bill, the parliament needs to take note of the changing work patterns occurring in society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, when I first entered the work force&mdash;I dare say when you first entered it&mdash;we all aspired to a permanent job that we might hold for 40&hyphen;odd years. The reality today is that when people enter the work force it may not be for a full&hyphen;time job, it may be for a part-time job. Whether you are female or male, you can anticipate periods where you will be in full&hyphen;time employment, periods where you might be in part-time employment and periods where you might withdraw completely from the work force. Increasingly this is happening to both men and women in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For families there can be no more important responsibility than the care and upbringing of their children. In looking at this mobility in the work force, this changing work pattern and the need for workers to be completely retrained for different occupations throughout their lifetimes, the availability of child care becomes absolutely important for families. I contend that child care is exceptionally beneficial for the children involved. Like other speakers, I have to confess that in the past my family has been privileged to be able to utilise child care for our four children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We keep on being abused by government members about our record of 13 years. But one of the achievements that we can point to is the tremendous increase in the availability of child-care places. Much as I am proud of that&mdash;and I am sure most members on this side of the House are proud of that&mdash;there are still not sufficient places to meet demand, and then there are issues of equity and access to child care. One of the popular refrains these days is to bemoan the fact that single parents may be in receipt of social security benefits <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and to injunct them to get back into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I go around my electorate and talk to women in this situation, one of the keys for them re&hyphen;entering the work force is, in fact, the availability of child care. One of the things that I find I am rather horrified about is the fact that there can often be just a marginal difference between them remaining at home or entering the work force and paying for child care. Economically, it is almost a case of indifference&mdash;that is, there is hardly a benefit in it and, if there is, it is marginal. But, of course, it does wonders for them and for their self&hyphen;esteem and confidence, and they are very keen to take up whatever opportunities there are. Regrettably, under this present government, there are going to be decreasing opportunities in the workplace, not increased opportunities. For a whole variety of reasons, child care is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our society there is nothing more special than to entrust a family member&mdash;whether it is a child or an aged person&mdash;into the care and responsibility of others. In child care, you entrust very young children into the care of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We get into some ideological debates. If I say that I have a preference for community based child care, perhaps some people will say that I am being an ideologue. That may be the case. I recognise that there are private child-care providers and that they have a role in our society. But I want to mention some figures about child care in the two local government areas in my electorate. Firstly, Blacktown has 20 long day care centres catering for 1,350 children, three out of school hours programs catering for 93 children and a family day care service catering for 600 children. I might say that the family day care service employs some 142 carers. Secondly, Penrith Council has 17 long day care centres, nine out of school hours centres and one occasional day care centre catering for something like 2,000 children. Penrith claims that they are the child&hyphen;care capital of New South Wales. As I have said before, I do not get into that debate. I just say that both councils have demonstrated a real commitment to young families in their respective <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6537"> areas because of the number of community based child&hyphen;care centres that they are involved in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we say that the opposition is going to cut out the operational subsidy, it sounds as though it is so many dollars and cents and perhaps it is a very small amount and, after all, aren't we just a whingeing opposition? Let me say that, for Blacktown Council, the amount of the operational subsidy for its centres is $800,000 per annum. For Penrith Council, it is about $740,000 per annum. I know that Blacktown and Penrith are fairly significant councils. Indeed, Penrith&mdash;a Liberal controlled council, I might add&mdash;was so strapped for cash that it increased the rates by nine per cent this year. I do not have to tell you just what multiples over and above the rate of inflation that represents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that I really want to make&mdash;and it is not to score political points&mdash;is that they just do not have that money available to pick up the shortfall. They cannot say to the federal government, `Oh well, you have cut the operational subsidy; we'll pick it up.' They just do not have that spare cash available. So what does that mean? It means that the users of the centre are going to have to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot about battlers. I am proud of the fact that I have a pretty large amount of public housing in my electorate. The private housing is often what I would call first level or first time private home owner. In other words, the families have scraped together every cent and probably borrowed to the hilt to get into the house they call their own and pay off their mortgage. So an unforeseen increase like this is just absolutely devastating. To say that it will have no impact is just a lot of bunkum. In fact, these measures, ripping hundreds of millions of dollars out of child care, is one of the most savage attacks on the women of Australia, in particular the women of my electorate and their children, that I have ever seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot about the women who have come onto the government side. I welcome that. Congratulations! But I am puzzled that they should applaud and endorse such a move that has such a devastating effect on women <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and their children and what they seek for them in the world of work. If anything, you would have thought that the government would have had a more compassionate and humane side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least, it has really been through the commitment of the previous Labor government that we have so many child&hyphen;care places in the Penrith and Blacktown city council areas. But where are the additional places going to come from? Are they going to come through serendipity? Are we going to have some magic&mdash;and suddenly there will be some child&hyphen;care places created there? It really does require a commitment by the government to ensuring that those people who wish to utilise child care for their children, those women and families who want to get out into the work force or to return to the work force, are able to do so because of the availability of child&hyphen;care places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no commitment in this bill to fund the sorts of increases that we have enjoyed under the previous government. It is no wonder that so many people have rung me in my office or spoken to me absolutely dumbfounded about the stance of a government that claims to have families as a special priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really resent this bill. I am certainly opposed to it. I think it turns the clock and the debate back 10 or 20 years. I assure my constituents that I and my colleagues on this side will not give up, have not lost heart and will not lose the great objectives that we have had in the past about child care. We only seek the chance to re&hyphen;implement them at the first available opportunity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would first like to thank the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) for his courtesy in cutting short his speech to give me the opportunity to make some comments in this debate on the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill. When I looked at the speakers list for this bill I noticed there were 14 speakers listed&mdash;13 from the opposition and only one from the government. Of the 14 people who have spoken on this matter this week, 13 are from the opposition. Only one government member would stand in this parliament this week and seek to support the bill that is now before the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is for good reason. They know this is a bad piece of legislation. They know this hurts a lot of Australian people. They know it is not just hurting Australian people in taking money from their pockets, but it is affecting their lifestyles. This is not just a piece of legislation that takes money from Australians from whom it should not, because it certainly does that. This is a piece of legislation that goes to the very lifestyle choices that Australian families make. This is a piece of legislation that is designed to engineer an outcome in families that happens to suit a model that those in the government believe should be the prevailing view, believe should be the dominant position, of family activity in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pernicious in that respect. It is also harmful in the way in which it has focused upon community child&hyphen;care centres. It has been focused deliberately to attack the very heart of the community child&hyphen;care system within this country. The decision to remove operational subsidies is one issue that has justifiably brought great criticism from one corner of the country to the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents deliberately choose to send their children to a community child&hyphen;care centre rather than a private care provider. They do it for many reasons. Having spoken to many parents who have been involved in this decision making process, many of them do it because they want their child to be in a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6540"> community centre where they, as parents, have a direct involvement in the administration and operation of the centre and in the delivery of services as part of the community, not simply as a purchaser of goods and services as they might if they were buying a bottle of coca&hyphen;cola. They make a decision very consciously that their child's care should be something they have a say in, even though they may not be there for the hours that the child is in care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is deliberately striking at the choice those parents make. It is deliberately targeting community child&hyphen;care centres. In my electorate in the central city area of Brisbane I have a range of community child&hyphen;care centres that cover the full socioeconomic bracket. One of those child&hyphen;care centres, Koolyangarra, specialises in providing assistance to low income families, particularly to migrants from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds and to Aboriginal and Islander families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That child&hyphen;care centre, because of its target client group, ensures that its fees are at the lowest possible level so it can provide support which the community values. That community knows that without that support many of those young children would grow up in much worse circumstances. With these changes and with the difficulties they have confronted they have approached the department. Indeed, I have written to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who is at the table, about their plight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they approached the department the caring shoulder they leant on said, `Find another clientele. Find someone else who can afford to pay higher rates.' In other words, they said, `Turn away those children who come to you from difficult family backgrounds, from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds. Put them back on the streets and go and find someone who can afford to pay a higher bill.' That has been the response from this government. To the best of my knowledge, I have not got a response from the minister at all to the letter which I sent in relation to this matter. Given that the minister is at the table, that is something she might like to take account of.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the last few months, I have attended a number of meetings at community child&hyphen;care centres with providers, with parents and with others. I have been touched by the concern they raised. I have been touched by the stories they tell of the decisions they arrive at. One of the things that stands out&mdash;it is a bit like this debate&mdash;is the absence of any government members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most recent meetings I attended was not in my electorate; it was in an adjoining electorate, in the seat of Lilley. The community child&hyphen;care people there had arranged a meeting. They sent invitations in turn to some five or six Liberal members of parliament from Brisbane. We all know there is no shortage of Liberal members from Queensland in this federal parliament at the moment. Not one of them would turn up&mdash;not a single, solitary one would turn up at that meeting. Even the member whose electorate it was in would not turn up. The child&hyphen;care centre where we held the meeting was literally across the road and two houses from the local federal member, the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This schedule seeks to eliminate the operational subsidy that is currently paid to community based long day care and the opposition has indicated that it will be opposing this schedule for a number of very important reasons. The first, I would have to say, is that one of the roles an opposition has is to keep a government to its promises. This government made it very clear before the election that they intended to keep the operational subsidy for community based long day care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of removing the operational subsidy will be that centres will have two choices. Either they will put up their fees by anything between $20 and $25 a week per child or&mdash;this is the one the government favours&mdash;they will have to reduce their services. One service all the community based centres around Australia are considering <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> removing is the more extensive, highly qualified staff that they have in their centres. The effect will be a reduction in the quality of care children in community based centres have in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, parents will be required to either pay more for food or provide lunches, fresh fruit, morning tea and afternoon tea for their children in the centres. That will mean that parents will indirectly be paying more for their children's care. Other services that centres are talking about removing are nappy services and other services that in any other place would be considered essential services. To say that somehow this move is going to improve efficiency I can only say is very short&hyphen;sighted and is not a view of efficiency I can understand. This view of efficiency equates poorer quality, more children per staff member, poorly qualified staff and lesser services with efficiency&mdash;a very funny definition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is very important for those members opposite to recognise is that all around Australia there are people writing to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and me about their very grave concerns of these changes. I have letters from all the states and territories of Australia. In the short time available, I will choose a couple of paragraphs from some of them to show the huge concern that exists in the community about this change. It is a very serious change because it is going to abolish the notion of community based long day care in this country. I would like to quote from a letter to the Prime Minister, a copy of which the writer sent to me. She is from Western Australia and she says: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I am aware that your government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>she is writing to the Prime Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is obsessed with the notion that almost all goods and services can be provided better and cheaper by the "private sector", in child care that is simply not the case and is never likely to be. You have completely underestimated the role community based child care centres play in upholding the quality of service to ensure that our children have the best of care. The community based centres have set the benchmarks for quality care of children, industry leadership and innovation. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6542"> </PARA>
<PARA>These are the things that we will lose as a result of this operational subsidy being abolished by this government. This is something the now government, before the election, led the community based child&hyphen;care sector to believe would not happen. She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many families like ours, the selection of a carer for our children is not just a market commodity, we want a place that provides a framework of fundamental values to do with family and community, social responsibility and somewhere where we can feel we can have a strong input about the care provided. Our community based centre provides this but is now threatened by your budget cut.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the sentiment that is reflected all around Australia. If we go to New South Wales, to a completely different type of organisation, the Benevolent Society of New South Wales&mdash;as it says at the top of their letterhead, `Caring for Australians since 1813'&mdash;also says to the government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of child care is far more complex than this policy suggests&mdash;this policy of seeing efficiency from the narrow framework of getting rid of a subsidy just to save money.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The operational subsidy is currently paid on a non means tested basis to community centres, even though they currently provide only 30 per cent of all centre based care. Community based centres cater for about 70,000 families. Operational subsidy has never been paid to private centres, despite the fact that they provide 70 per cent of centre based care, catering for more than 220,000 Australian families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, all special or high cost services provided by community child&hyphen;care centres are also provided by the private child&hyphen;care sector. Accordingly, there is no justification to continue with the differential in government assistance between the two sectors, clearly prejudicing one group of parents. The removal of the untargeted operational subsidy from community child-care centres removes a significant inequity in government assistance that currently exists between families using the different facilities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Barton (Mr McClelland) implied that the private sector is not subject to the same standards as the community based sector. Quality is assured in both sectors through the state and territory licensing regulations and the Commonwealth government's quality improvement and accreditation system. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) can reassure constituents that the government is committed to maintaining accreditation and to extending it to outside school hours care and, in particular, to family day care, which is a very flexible option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Operational subsidy has been retained in family day care and in occasional care. I heard one of the members opposite saying that we are going to cut all of the subsidies to all child&hyphen;care services. The fact is that we will be spending $5 billion in this term of government on child-care services. We will be retaining operational subsidy for the family day care program, for occasional care, for outside school hours care, for the multifunctional services and the multifunctional Aboriginal children's services. These services are crucial to meeting the diverse needs of Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly for family day care, the operational subsidy fund is a central coordinating unit which monitors quality and supports carers. The government also provides training and support for family day carers to provide good quality care in the home environment and to family day care coordination units to assist them to provide quality care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The private sector cares for almost twice as many babies, almost twice as many special needs children and more children from low income families than the community based long day care sector. Even though the private sector provides these services, their fees, on an average, are only $4 a week higher than the community based centres, and of course they operate without the operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Savings have been directed and we have been very responsible on this. I heard the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) quoting from letters, but I have to say that we have spoken, along with my department, to many of the community based sectors&mdash;some of the big groups operating community based long <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6543"> day care&mdash;and they are working constructively with us in a responsible manner to ensure that they maintain a high standard of care and that fees are not unduly affected by this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have done this in a responsible way. We have allowed plenty of time for restructuring to take place. We have directed much of the savings from this measure into other areas. Over the next four years $10.9 million will be provided to fund new places in rural and remote areas. After all, these are the parents in our community who have been most affected by the economic conditions brought about by the former government. These are people who have suffered drought, who have suffered economic hardship and who also have not been, under the former government, receiving very much assistance at all in terms of child-care facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will provide $10 million per year, and $31 million has been set aside to support the inclusion of children with high level and additional needs, particularly those children who have disabilities. We have set aside $8.3 million over the two years to enable community centres to obtain financial and management advice on options to help them restructure their services. We will also provide $4 million per annum to ensure that families in areas of economic disadvantage will maintain access to child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been a responsible measure. We have not pulled the rug out from under them, as the former government was intending to do. We have done it in a responsible and restructured manner, allowing plenty of time for this restructuring to take place without disadvantage to the families who care to use, and choose to use, the community based centres. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) in opposing schedule 1 on the basis that abolishing the operating subsidy for community long day care is a very retrograde step. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware, the struggle for affordable quality child care has been long and arduous for many of the families in working-class areas such as the area that I represent. They are battling fami <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> lies&mdash;the battlers so championed by the coalition in the run&hyphen;up to the election. The abolition of operating subsidies to community based child-care centres is a measure which hits hard at the aspirations of these families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another reason I wish to take the small time that is available to me to speak to this measure is that I have a feeling of deja vu about some of the aspects of this debate. In 1985, when I was the President of the then Shire of Whittlesea, I was in the position where, as the leader of a Labor controlled council, I found myself in dispute with the state Labor government and the federal Labor government. The basis of that was that we as a municipality had decided, as part of improving the access to child care, to build a long day child&hyphen;care centre. We had the building, but we found ourselves in dispute over the operating subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the basis of that dispute? It was the same sort of basis that we are seeing trotted out today. I went through some of the cuttings from that time. There were allegations that expenditure on child-care centres was excessive. There were allegations that, if organisations did not receive the subsidies, they would have an incentive to reduce costs. There were allegations that families would be able to pay the higher fees and that sponsoring bodies might be more capable of putting in additional moneys. The argument was false then&mdash;and it remains false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that community child care has displayed the type of benchmarks that were necessary. At that time, in 1985, we were seeing the federal government not willing to cover the costs of the type of child care that was required under state legislation. We have had this battle. We have won this battle, and now, through this budgetary measure, we want to be taken a step back. It is wrong. It is only through community child care that we are able to give families in the suburbs that I represent access to quality child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To now place those child-care centres under pressure is mean&hyphen;spirited indeed. What are the alternatives? The alternatives are to increase fees. I would contend that for the families who use these centres it would be a great hardship and very difficult. Are we to see the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6544"> committees of management of these centres now look at such issues as the staff ratio of qualified staff to non-qualified staff?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we contend in this debate, the community sector has shown the lead by having ratios that are over and above the standards set by the states. This is what people would like to see. It is a matter of choice. It is a matter of being able to choose to take their children to centres such as this. Because of the special needs of such areas as Thomastown West and Lalor West in my electorate&mdash;basic working&hyphen;class suburbs&mdash;without access to community child care they would have to go back to the bad old days of backyard operators. There should also be the ability to adjust the ratio based on the age of the children who are within the centres. These things will place pressure upon the centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The council was able to place the centre I have been talking about in the hands of a community committee of management. It is now run not by the council but by the community committee of management. The people who are managing these centres on a voluntary basis are going to have to contend with difficult issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister is fair dinkum about the type of transitional arrangements that she has spoken about, I hope we will see areas such as in my electorate amongst those assisted. If this measure goes through, I am worried that these things will not be properly targeted. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This is a very important issue and one which those opposite should listen to. They might also listen to the views of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), because they will discover that the minister actually agrees with our amendment, as it actually corrects a mistake in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill. The original bill intended to give the Health Insurance Commission an open-ended power to defer making a decision about a claim for the child-care cash rebate. So, if the commission did nothing, people would not be paid the child-care cash rebate that they would be entitled to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, of course, would have meant that families, parents, would have been guilty until proven innocent.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition has long supported the recognition of the costs of child care associated with employment.</PARA>
<PARA>They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Coalition government will maintain the non-means tested childcare cash rebate.</PARA>
<PARA>Child care, as the coalition apparently readily agreed to before the election, is a legitimate work related expense. Both parents cannot work without decently provided child care. Senator Newman, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, has conceded that child care is a legitimate work related expense. But this government, in breaking yet another promise it went to the election with, has changed its mind. What they are saying now is, `We don't think it is a legitimate work related expense. We think the whole amount spent on child care should be reduced.' Something the minister failed to mention in her remarks earlier is that this government is reducing the amount spent on child care by $500 million&mdash;$500 million that will have to come out of the pockets of parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the coalition's logic, why shouldn't highly paid men who claim tax deductions for expensive tools, or lawyers who claim for their professional libraries, or politicians who claim for whatever they claim for be subject to the means test? We are not in here debating that issue because this government does not want to address this front on. It does not want to take into account that it is a legitimate work related expense, that women who work have to take out expensive child care. Certainly, with this government, they will be paying a lot more for child care. They will be paying the $500 million out of their pockets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government wants to do is make sure that we yet again have the debate which we actually solved while we were in government. What you will see come out of this decision is a claim for tax deductibility of child care&mdash;something that I would hope nobody in this House would support because of the regressive nature of such a move. The rebate recognised that child care was a legitimate work related expense, but it was not introduced in a way that gave much more benefit to those at the top end of the income <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6546"> scale and zero to those who did not earn any taxable income. This is another retrograde step, another broken promise, another message to working women that their place is not in the work force but in the home&mdash;go home, do not bother about child care. This is Howard style political correctness and we will not have a bar of it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You do not know the meaning of `means test'. We have not abolished the rebate. However, the government considers that it is only fair and equitable that higher income earners make a contribution&mdash;and it is a small contribution&mdash;to their child&hyphen;care costs. Under the changes announced to the rebate, families with incomes below the new family tax initiative cut&hyphen;offs of $70,000 for one child, rising by $3,000 for each additional child, will continue to receive a 30 per cent rebate, while families with incomes above those limits will be restricted to a rebate of 20 per cent. This measure reduces benefits only for families in the top 20 per cent of family incomes in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a great number of unmet needs out there in the community. As a government, we have a responsibility to ensure equitable evenness in the distribution of child-care subsidies. I find it puzzling that the opposition is so keen to promote the interests of higher income earners but does not believe that higher income earners should draw any comfort from this stance. Labor appears to have a more sinister agenda for higher income earners, as hinted at by the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield), who was adamant <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in his claim that high income people do not need child-care facilities.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to make the point that, while the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) denied that the claims made by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) were correct, she has simply confirmed that they were. She has indicated that the cut&hyphen;off point is $70,000. The differential treatment of families below and above that figure indicates that quite clearly a means test is being applied. The member for Jagajaga quoted directly from the manifesto that government parties used prior to the last election when she said that the coalition said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition has long supported the recognition of the costs of child care associated with employment.</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Coalition government will maintain the non-means tested childcare cash rebate.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, the government parties are not doing that. The government is repudiating another very clear, unqualified undertaking that was given in its own manifesto. The litany of broken promises gradually being added to by this government is bringing it into serious disrepute. It is not just a matter of political dishonesty; it is an increasing example of the way in which the Australian people were hoodwinked and were taken for mugs by this government and, increasingly, they are becoming aware of it. All of these examples will come back to haunt the coalition.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a third time.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition has established a strategic direction for child care which is sustainable in the long term, offers greater flexibility to parents and protects the benefits of low and middle income earners while ensuring that high income earners who can afford to make a greater contribution to their child&hyphen;care costs do so. The opposition's failure to support the key measures in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 reflects Labor's arro <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6548"> gant disregard for mainstream Australia&mdash;families who, for the last 13 years, have been struggling to make ends meet&mdash;and its lack of concern for ensuring equity and fairness to all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor believes that high income earners should be entitled to the same benefits as low income earners, that subsidies should be paid to community based care centres, irrespective of people's income, and that 220,000 families in private long day care&mdash;that is 70 per cent of families in centre based care&mdash;should be ignored and receive fewer subsidies than other families. The coalition does not accept this position and I do not believe that the majority of Australian families do either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure contained in the bill eliminates Labor's inequities, treating families who use community based long day care no differently from the majority of families who use private long day care. Labor has taken a conscious decision to support the current flawed system and has run a deliberate and irresponsible scare campaign aimed at frightening parents into believing that they will be worse off because of the government's measures. Nowhere has this been better evident than in the course of this particular debate. I welcome this opportunity to repudiate many of the claims that have been made by the opposition both in this place and within the general community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the budget, the opposition has told families that, because of the removal of operational subsidy from community based long day care, services will close or fees will rise. At one point, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) was claiming that fees could rise by more than $50 per week. In the course of this debate we have heard a number of case studies from the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) and her colleagues suggesting that all families using community based long day care will have to pay extra amounts. The member for Fremantle even cited one example where costs would go up by over $55 per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would strongly encourage parents to challenge claims that fees will necessarily increase, certainly to that extent, because of the government's budget measures. Families <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cannot and should not trust the figures being touted by the opposition because every time we hear the opposition speak about these it is a different figure. It has ranged from $15 a week extra to $58 a week and beyond. They cannot be relied upon on those figures. Nor should parents accept claims by centres that they have had to increase fees because of new government policies. I am aware of at least one situation where a child&hyphen;care centre has written to parents in those terms. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This centre is increasing its fees in January, three months before any changes come into effect, and even though it is a private centre which is not affected by the removal of operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe Australian parents must challenge the claims of many of the centres that are threatening to put up fees immediately and blaming this government's budget measures in that respect. Suggestions by the opposition that all families with children in community based long day care centres will face massive fee increases are a gross embellishment of the truth. I want to make the point that 44 per cent of families using private sector care are on maximum child&hyphen;care assistance, compared with 39 per cent of families in community based long day care. It is inequitable that none of these parents receive the same level of subsidy as the parents using the community based centres. The opposition has not been able to produce a single reason to justify this discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the course of the debate on this bill, the opposition has referred to other child&hyphen;care measures that are not contained in this legislation, but I feel compelled to address those measures because there are gross misrepresentations of fact in some cases.

<PARA>opposition has unfairly represented the 50&hyphen;hour cap that will apply to child&hyphen;care assistance as a disincentive to work. The member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) claimed that, if parents work long hours, the Howard government is now saying that they have to pay full costs once child&hyphen;care goes over 50 hours a week. Nothing could be further from the truth. This initiative places a weekly limit of 50 hours per child on the amount of care attracting child&hyphen;care assistance, unless families genuinely require that extra care to meet their work related commitments. Families who use more than 50 hours of care for work related reasons, including travel time to and from study or work, training or looking for work, will continue to be able to claim child&hyphen;care assistance for that care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vast majority of families use much less than 50 hours of care per week. The average is only 26 hours. Currently, though, 22,500 families are using less than 50 hours of care but are being charged by their service providers for receiving child&hyphen;care assistance for more than 50 hours. That means this government is paying out for services that are not being rendered. I do not believe any responsible government can continue to take that course. In fact, only 4,500 families use the hours that they have booked over 50 hours. It is blatantly unfair to expect Australian taxpayers to subsidise care that is being charged to the government but is not being used. In that respect, I wish to table and have included in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a chart which clearly shows the situation in regard to 50 hours.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition members also attacked the government's decision to give parents across service types the choice, from 1 January 1998, to have their child&hyphen;care benefits paid directly to them or their child&hyphen;care service. While child-care assistance may currently be paid to providers, like the child-care cash rebate, which is already paid to parents, child-care assistance is not intended to benefit services but to assist parents with the cost of their care. That is what this is all about. It is time we got back to first principles here. I find the suggestion that child-care providers will lose their certainty of funding because of this measure highly offensive. The implication is that families will not use their child-care payments to pay their child-care fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message coming clearly from the Labor Party is that the government should pay services because parents cannot be trusted to pay their bills. Why stop at child care? The logical extension of that argument, of the rationale put up by the member for Fremantle, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6550"> is that parents should not receive any pay cheques; rather, the government should pay people's bills, because they might spend the money on something else. In other words, as the member for Fremantle said in her opening speech, parents cannot be trusted. I think that is highly offensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents who receive child-care assistance already must pay the minimum fee plus any gap fee. Child-care assistance is not payable unless the family pays its contribution. Paying benefits to parents clearly acknowledges that families are the intended beneficiaries, not the services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has also been made by the opposition of the Economic Planning Advisory Commission's interim report on child care. Contrary to the opposition's claims, the report is not the government's blueprint. It is an interim report only and it was commissioned by the former Labor government. Someone from the other side said when he was in government:</PARA>

<PARA>This government is committed to delivering a fair and equitable child-care system and to redressing the deficiencies of that system that we inherited and to making the hard decisions that Labor seemed incapable of taking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to remind the House that, although we have removed the operational subsidy from the community based long day care, $526 million in operational subsidy will be provided over the next four years to support services such as family day care, occasional care, outside school hours care and multi&hyphen;functional care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Some very important issues need to be raised in finalising this debate. We have had from the minister a discussion about the impact of the 50&hyphen;hour change. It will have a very serious impact on private centres as well as community based centres. What they are all saying to me is that they will not be able to make sure that they have staff on tap, available for parents to meet their changing, flexible work needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it is going to mean is an increase in the casualisation of workers in the child-care sector. We are going to see child-care workers coming and going throughout the day. These are workers that are already on low wages. These are workers that are already highly dedicated to their task. What this measure is going to do is make their working conditions even worse. The most important thing for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those workers is making sure that they deliver a high quality service to the children in their care. They will not be able to do this with this change to 50 hours. It is a very serious matter. It is a matter that the private sector has raised, along with the community based sector. It is not something that can be just swept under the carpet and done away with as a budget measure. This government says that it wants to provide flexible long day care for children in this country. It will not be able to do that with the introduction of this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has also talked extensively in her comments about quality. She says that quality is assured, that accreditation will continue. I hope that means that she will repudiate the small business task force, which recommends to this government that the Commonwealth get out of accreditation, that the Commonwealth not get involved, that accreditation be left up to the market. That is not the sort of accreditation system that we want. That is not the sort of accreditation system that anybody in the child-care sector wants. It is certainly not what parents want. Not one parent in Australia would want to see the Commonwealth walk away from its commitment to the delivery of high quality child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I call on the government to immediately repudiate the Small Business Deregulation Task Force recommendation that says that the Commonwealth get out of it. I have never seen a more short&hyphen;sighted recommendation as that coming from the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. Of course, the government only see things from the perspective of the market. This is not a market; this is about children. This is about making sure that our children are cared for&mdash;something that we on this side of the House are proud to have stood up for and will continue to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996 is the bill we don't have to have. There is no doubt that, with a change of government and with the discretion that the current Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) has&mdash;discretion that has been confirmed in recent court hearing after recent court hearing&mdash;there is no impediment to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge proceeding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of this legislation can fairly be described as the `Ian McLachlan payback bill'. This is the legislation that this government is introducing in an attempt to vindicate the disgraceful performance by the current Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) when he was shadow minister that led to him resigning from the frontbench. It is a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that tomorrow the minister is launching a book in relation to the Hindmarsh Island affair and it is interesting that the cheer squad is in the gallery this evening. I think it is fair to say that the Minister for Defence would be more productive spending his time looking after his portfolio than introducing a bill into this parliament that is absolutely unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week a financial report for 1995&hyphen;96 from the Department of Defence was tabled in this House. That showed that the military budget blew out by $100 million in the last financial year. You would have been better off putting your attention to bringing the Department of Defence into line and maybe sending in a special auditor.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some amendments that are circulating that I will be moving during this debate. They support the view that we hold that this bill is totally unnecessary. At the conclusion of the second reading debate, I will be moving:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the construction of the Hindmarsh Island bridge can now proceed without further delay and without prejudicing the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975".</PARA>

<PARA>If the government were fair dinkum, they would have no problems supporting that amendment during the consideration in detail stage of the bill. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has declared in this House that his government will respect the provisions and the spirit of the Racial Discrimination Act. Coalition policy says that we should respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a debate last week in relation to racial tolerance in this country where both sides of the House, it is fair to say, supported the resolution. It is not in dispute in this country any more that all major political parties have it in their policies to respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. This bill does not do that. If the government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6553"> says that it does, then it should have no problem supporting the amendment in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act that I propose to move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government says it is unnecessary, then it just becomes a motherhood resolution. In the current climate, it is necessary to send a signal out to the community. Let us put it beyond doubt: if the Minister for Defence says it is unnecessary, he should have no problem in supporting it. If it is unnecessary, all it is is a statement of principle that all sides of the House agree on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the reality is it is necessary because this is a discriminatory bill. This bill discriminates against a class of person; namely, indigenous people. This bill is not necessary because we have had a change of government. We have a minister who has an absolute discretion and a parliament that has an absolute discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs currently has before him another report under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 in relation to Boobera Lagoon. He was given that report dated 20 April 1996 on 22 April 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was taken to court in relation to the Boobera Lagoon because it is fair to say that the Boobera Lagoon report recommends protection of the Boobera Lagoon. It is a positive report under the heritage protection act, but indigenous people in New South Wales are powerless to force the minister to exercise his discretion one way or the other. The best they can do is ask the minister to exercise his discretion one way or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister in response to a question in the Senate on Monday, 28 October 1996 floundered, but then had incorporated into the Senate record on Tuesday, 29 October 1996 an answer to the question we put to him. It is worth reading. We asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does the government intend to introduce legislation into parliament regarding Boobera Lagoon?</PARA>
<PARA>His answer to that was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c): I do not intend to introduce special legislation in relation to Boobera Lagoon.</PARA>
<PARA>Why? Because his discretion under the act at the moment is absolute. There is nothing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stopping the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge commencing tomorrow. Indeed, since December, when the Federal Court confirmed an earlier decision of the single court judge, there has been no protection order in existence in relation to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge area, which leaves it absolutely open for that bridge to proceed. There has been no protection order in existence since 7 December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a change of government and a new minister, the minister's discretion is absolute. We are told in the second reading speech that it is all too hard. Frankly, the minister is asleep at the wheel. That is the problem. We are told:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to prepare separate special legislation to overcome the current situation is seen by the government as being the most practical course to resolve the issue once and for all.</PARA>
<PARA>How fair dinkum is this government? Is this a bill that is requiring urgency? Has the government made any attempt to turn this into an urgent bill? No. We have a letter from the opposition whip in the Senate, Senator Chris Evans, dated 28 October 1996, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Daryl</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please be advised that the Government Leader in the Senate, Senator Robert Hill, has advised that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill is one of a group of Bills that will unlikely be dealt with in the Senate this year.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Hill has advised the Leaders and Whips of all parties in the Senate that he would be hopeful of dealing with the high priority Bills this year, but accepts that it is highly unlikely that the Senate would deal with any Bills not contained in that high priority group.</PARA>

Anyone with half a brain knows it. There are some procedures that need to be followed.

That is what this is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that this minister has the benefit of a number of Federal Court decisions. He has the benefit of a High Court decision delivered on 6 September that said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a determination is essentially a political function.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It reflects the fundamental differences between the introduced common law system and the legal system of the indigenous oral culture.

<PARA>Justice Mathews says on page 2:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the applicant women have not been prepared to reveal the contents of any restricted women's knowledge. Accordingly it has been unnecessary in this Report to embark upon the vexed issue of whether "women's business" or restricted "women's knowledge" exists in Ngarrindjeri culture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of restricted women's knowledge, other issues assumed much greater significance under the application than had initially been anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the reasons the women did not cooperate in providing that material is that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6555"> current government would not provide a female minister to receive the evidence. Notwithstanding that, the position is that Tickner and Western Australia says in effect that what you have to do in providing procedural fairness and natural justice in terms of common law is basically provide the information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Broome crocodile farm case is an example of cases that have recently been decided by the Federal Court. The reality is, however, irrespective of whether the women were to go down that path and provide the material that satisfied the minister, that the minister still has an absolute discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Justice Elizabeth Evatt&mdash;remember her?&mdash;has written the report on the review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. She has just been re-elected to the United Nations human rights section. She got the second highest vote, supported by your government. She confirms the absolute discretion that the minister now has. She says on page 15 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal people are critical of the Act because the power to protect areas and objects is discretionary. The Minister is not obliged to act, even if an area is of significance to Aboriginal people. He/she can revoke a declaration without any express requirement to consult the parties. The Act does not specify criteria which, when established, confer a right to a declaration. The political nature of the discretion is discussed in Chapter 10.</PARA>
<PARA>She cites the Wamba Wamba Local Aboriginal Land Council v. Minister Administering the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, which talks about discretion under section 9 and it flows over to section 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, on this side, can see that with the change of government the minister has an absolute discretion. There is absolutely no way this bridge can be stopped. So why is the legislation necessary? The legislation is necessary as a political stunt to vindicate the Minister for Defence and indeed the Liberal Party. It is not necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You won the last election. The reality is that you should withdraw your involvement in this matter. The fact is that you have lost all objectivity. You are shaming yourself in relation to this. I am not standing here and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> saying it is a decision that is out of our hands.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of options. There is an argument that no further material is necessary, that there is enough material in the public domain for the minister to withdraw from the process and objectively consider all the material that is available.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4T4">Mr MELHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is really interesting. They are not interested in debating the merits of what I am saying. I had the benefit of the minister sending us legal advice on an in&hyphen;confidence basis&mdash;and I will not breach the confidence of the legal advice. I understand where they are coming from. We were given permission to give those legal opinions to our legal advisers, and there is disagreement&mdash;strong disagreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing I will say about the legal advice that the government was relying on and sent to us&mdash;because the minister issued a press release the day after saying that he had sent us the confidential legal advice&mdash;is that the advice was prepared without the bill being before those legal advisers. The minister said in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also attach, on an in&hyphen;confidence basis, a copy of legal advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. The advice confirms that the only way to avoid further legal delays and expense to the construction of the bridge is by legislation. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6556"> </PARA>
<PARA>That is not borne out in the advice. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you will see from the bill, I have also taken account of your concerns about retrospectivity and the Racial Discrimination Act. The Bill is consistent with the RDA and is not retrospective.</PARA>
<PARA>If the bill is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, then the government should have no problems in supporting the amendment that I will be moving in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act in the consideration in detail stage of this bill. If they do not, then they will be exposed not only for their hypocrisy but for being too smart by half. Surely, in all the public utterances of the Prime Minister in other places and in this parliament, they are duty bound to support a clause that respects the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to retrospectivity, it does take away existing rights. The bill is retrospective. You have only to go to clause 4(2), which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Heritage Protection Act does not authorise the Minister to take any action after the commencement of this Act in relation to an application (whether made before or after the commencement of this Act) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So this bill reaches back in time. Frankly, we have supported retrospective legislation in the past in terms of its effect. But let the government know that that is what they are doing. They are taking away existing rights and they can only do it in a retrospective fashion. So the minister's advice does not add up in relation to that because it is retrospective in effect. That is the only reason that you are bringing the bill&mdash;that there is an existing application that you say is a legitimate application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the High Court's decision in Wilson's case, as a result of the recent Federal Court decisions, this whole thing could be resolved without any doubt whatsoever by the minister using someone within the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. He has got the advice from Father Frank Brennan in relation to this. He can pick up all the existing material that was picked up by Justice Mathews and that he now has. It is all publicly available material. They could go through the motions and this could be resolved within a month. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They could allow a reporting date of 14 days after further submissions are received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court in Wilson's case says quite emphatically in that joint judgment that the reporter is not expressly required to hold a hearing. What I am saying to you is: this is a quicker, neater and cleaner solution. We do not need to say, `I'll drop my legal opinion, you drop your legal opinion, which lawyer is better.' Here, there is cross&hyphen;party support now and a concession. Fact No. 1, indisputable: no protection order exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your government solicitors were in the Federal Court recently in relation to Boobera Lagoon. In the matter of Boobera Lagoon, there is a positive report, a report that says a desecration is occurring&mdash;a desecration being the skiing on the lagoon. The desecration in this instance would be the building of the bridge, but there is no positive report in existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what happened in the Federal Court before Justice Foster. The legal advisers took it before Justice Foster on 17 October. Who was there? The Australian Government Solicitor for the respondents. This is what Justice Foster says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lagoon is claimed by the applicant, Toomelah Boggabilla Local Aboriginal Land Council ("the Land Council"), to be a "significant Aboriginal area" within the meaning of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. The Land Council also claims that the use of the Lagoon for the purpose of water&hyphen;skiing threatens it with serious injury or desecration within the meaning of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with s 10(1)(c) of the Act, the Minister has received a report from Mr Hal Wootten QC dealing with the matters referred to in s 10(4). The report has recommended the making of a declaration, inter alia, for the banning of water&hyphen;skiing on the lagoon for a period of 10 years from 1 May 1996. This report was received by the Minister on 20 April 1996. The Minister, however, has not yet made a decision in relation to the Land Council's application. That failure to make such a decision is the subject of application in these proceedings for appropriate relief.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is, in my view&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is Justice Foster&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">quite clear that the Court, at a final hearing in these proceedings, would have no power to order the Minister to make a declaration under s 9(1).

In this regard it must be borne in mind that the Minister may, in his discretion, refrain from making a declaration even though he is satisfied as to the matters referred to in social security 9(1)(b)(i) and (ii). <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it possible, then, for the Court at an interlocutory level to order the Minister to make the declaration sought in these proceedings?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act was considered in Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Mailanga.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on there is this quote:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even in relation to such matters, the power is restricted to the making of the "kinds" of orders, whether final or interlocutory, are capable of properly being seen as "appropriate" to be made by the Federal Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction.</PARA>

<PARA>Further on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as a matter power or jurisdiction, if release can be ordered at the final hearing, it must also be within the court's competence to make such an order at the interim stage, if this is otherwise appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view, having regard to these observations, s 23 cannot, in the present case, empower me to make an order at an interlocutory stage which could not, for the reasons given in Wamba Wamba, be made at a final hearing.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, I am satisfied that I do not have the power to make the order sought. This must result in the decision that I dismiss this aspect of the application and I so order.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this government is currently involved in legal proceedings where there is a positive report under the heritage protection act in relation to Boobera Lagoon and indigenous people are powerless to force the minister to exercise his discretion in favour of protection of the lagoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same principles apply. Why? Because on all the law, on any proper reading of the act, on any proper construction of the act, in Justice Mathews's report at page 12 it says that the minister has an absolute discretion, even if there is a positive report. That is why this legislation is unnecessary. All it does is cause further pain, further misery and further suffering to the indigenous community in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6558"> South Australia. It allows the cheer squad to go out and feel vindicated, but it is not good law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same week that this legislation was announced we had the symbol for the 2000 Olympics unveiled and we saw that it incorporates Aboriginal symbols. What sort of message is that? Actions must speak louder than words. We are getting the mea culpa in relation to what is happening on one side of the debate that is occurring at the moment, but on the other side of the debate special legislation is the first port of call for Century Zinc and special legislation is the next port of call for the Hindmarsh Island affair. There are 161 pages of amendments in the bill to amend the 127&hyphen;page Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that what is happening here is not necessary. This is a lazy government. It is a lazy minister who does not want to go through the processes. What are they saying? The minister opposite, who has been arguing for ages about the frivolous and vexatious nature of the original application, is now left arguing that it is not frivolous and vexatious and that that is why we need special legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I watched with great interest the Labor Party squirm over this Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a second.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, I would like to say that I hope the opposition votes against the bill because if consistency means anything in this place there is no other position the Labor Party can take.

I hope not, but I think I heard that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Labor Party votes for the bill, it will put itself in a dilemma. It will thereby admit that for two years, at unbelievable cost and unbelievable anguish, it supported the wrong cause. Alternatively, it will show that it always knew it was supporting the wrong cause and now it knows the political game is up. Make no mistake: the political game is up. In my state, everybody knows that the secret women's business was not true. You never mentioned it, except to give some slight credence to the fact that you might believe some of it had some merit.

In my state the people know the truth and they are sick to death of your support for those who peddle the fabrications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, if it were the second course you took, then that prosecution of the wrong cause was not only the support of a grand set of deceptions but deception in itself. The Labor party, from early 1994, consistently worked to have the Hindmarsh Island Bridge banned. I suspect that they thought it would look good to a certain constituency&mdash;not necessarily an Aboriginal constituency, although some Aboriginals took a ride on the coach, but really to appeal to that soft centre of political thought which will take on causes which sound as though they accord with some sympathetic or concerned view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter&mdash;and it did not matter, did it?&mdash;that the damage that was wrought, financial and emotional, was sometimes incalculable. In this case it was incalculable, even to those they purported to support. It mattered little that the truth lay somewhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party did not oppose this bridge because it was going to harm the environment, although that argument had some merit&mdash;not overwhelming, but some merit. It did not oppose the bridge because of federal government expenditure, because there was to be none. It sought to interfere in the affairs of the state. Remember, the state government builds the bridge. The state of South Australia builds the bridge. The federal government does not build the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It sought to interfere in the affairs of the state of South Australia after exhaustive reports and reviews which concluded that that bridge, for one reason or another, had to go ahead. It was contractual as much as anything. But the federal Labor government knew better and it sought to interfere for its own political purposes&mdash;and I have to say, `You got it right royally wrong.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have been prepared to forgive the former federal government after the first <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> delvings into this matter because of the less than satisfactory report by Professor Cheryl Saunders. That report was requested by the minister in April 1994 and provided in July of that year. But by the end of 1994 it was crystal clear that the elastic believability was near breaking point. You plunged on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We became aware, when we were on the other side of the House, by mid&hyphen;1994 that the matter was open to very great doubt. So on 9 November 1994 we moved a motion to disallow former Minister Tickner's 25&hyphen;year ban on the building of that bridge. The overriding ingredient from that moment on was that the truth of the matter seemed to be irrelevant&mdash;irrelevant not only to the federal Labor government but to the media at large, I have to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We pointed out in that November that Professor Saunders had not been near the South Australian Museum, a reasonable repository of anthropological knowledge, one would have thought. We pointed out that the main proponent of the secret women's business, Doreen Kartinyeri, had previously written that she did not know much about the culture, customs and language of her people. She was talking about the Ngarrindjeri culture, customs and language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We pointed out that the place that Doreen Kartinyeri described as secret women's business was supposed to be an exact place, yet Professor Cheryl Saunders said in the report that it comprised 100 square kilometres. We pointed out that no&hyphen;one but Kartinyeri seemed to have this knowledge. We pointed out that Saunders's report was categorically wrong on one fundamental point to do with Mr Justice Sam Jacobs's report. He described her view of his report on that matter as `outrageous'. We pointed out that this matter of secret women's business had never been raised, even indirectly, by anyone ever before in the context of the Ngarrindjeri people. We pointed out that the matter of secret women's business had never been raised by any of the anthropologists in respect of that much researched area and that much researched people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very importantly, I pointed out that the parliament was about to vote&mdash;you all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6560"> voted&mdash;on the disallowance motion on evidence that you were not allowed to see. You refused yourselves the luxury of seeing the evidence upon which you were about to vote. It was locked up in some envelopes that no-one was allowed to see or look at. At the end of that debate you voted to support the declaration to ban the bridge, fundamentally on the secret women's business. It was locked up in the envelopes. You voted for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that moment all the people in the Labor Party, including your colleagues in the Senate, voted for a conspiracy of fabrications, concoctions, inventions, lies and deceit the like of which this country has hardly ever seen in its history. That is what you voted for, and you stuck to it for the next year and a half. What is more, you did it on the basis of evidence that you held to be sacred. You were not allowed to look at it, but you held it to be sacred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later, when the former government and large elements of the media said that I had affronted the whole race by placing copies of the so&hyphen;called secret women's business on the table of this House, the government reviled me and anybody&mdash;I repeat: anybody&mdash;who supported the view that this secret women's business was open to doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind you of the accusations that were variously made in this chamber. They included `exploiting Aboriginals for political purposes', `deceivers who are inept', and `the untruths and the lies that the member for Barker had himself perpetrated'. And all of this time you were supporting a proposition inside some envelopes which you had never seen, which a judge could not see, which counsel was not allowed to argue and which led everybody to the eventual grand fabrication. And you were, in fact, the catalyst for that fabrication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week the Leader of the Opposition said in this House, on what was called the race debate, `Messages must always contain what we actually believe'&mdash;that is, messages out there. What did you actually believe about the secret women's business? Did you believe it? Or are you just fools? Or didn't you care? What did the Leader of the Opposition believe when he was sitting over here? Did he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believe it or did he just castigate us and call us liars all the time in this House on this subject? I will tell you what I think he believed: he did not believe any of it. He just followed the party line&mdash;go down the soft centre and see if you can make sure that your political opposition gets a bath. The problem was that it all went wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party knew that it was nigh on impossible for anyone to challenge the idea publicly that something called `secret women's business' could be bunkum. You sat behind that knowledge and you used the Ngarrindjeri people to give support to a conspiracy of fraud with no regard to the truth. What else is that if it is not racism? Not the racism of the ignorant bigot&mdash;but, much worse, the racism of the half&hyphen;intelligent calculator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you had not reckoned with was that the impossible would happen: that some other Ngarrindjeri women&mdash;for who else could actually overthrow the political correctness of the day, as no-one else could do it?&mdash;would display enormous courage and overthrow the lies of the fabricators of Hindmarsh Island.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is there anybody on that side of the House who believes that the minister has the capacity to say, `I will not hear a further application in this matter and will treat it as vexatious,' that is beyond his power or beyond his jurisdiction? The answer is that he has that capacity. But perhaps some of his ministerial colleagues do not have the same tolerance and the same level of understanding that I have given the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can think of no greater cause for a vote of no confidence from fellow ministers than to say, `Look, we know you have the discretion, we know you can say that this has been in and out of the courts and subject to challenge.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation also constitutes, as a result of the perpetration of this sort of attitude, as significant a vote of no&hyphen;confidence in your own minister for Aboriginal affairs as I have ever seen perpetrated by any government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was particularly disappointed at the contribution made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), and also by the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). Over the last 12 months these people and their colleagues have sought cynically to manipulate this whole issue of `women's business', which was found to be an absolute fabrication.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not often quote anthropologists in this place, but I would like to quote Dr Ron Brunton, an anthropologist with the Institute of Public Affairs. He commented on this particular activity which has resulted in the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996, which is before the House. He was referring to the way in which there have been a number of inquiries into the actions of the former Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6566"> Mr Tickner, who had sought to prevent the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. Referring to the Labor Party's conduct, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This fiasco serves as an unhappy metaphor for much that has been wrong with Aboriginal politics in Australia in recent years. Aboriginal heritage concerns were cynically exploited by people with an anti-development agenda. Influential people in the churches, the media, politics and the anthropology profession showed that they prefer Aboriginals who make adversarial claims&mdash;no matter how deceitful or ill-founded&mdash;to Aboriginals who approach their history and culture with integrity. Matters that could readily have been dismissed had key people shown a modicum of good judgment and probity require costly, politicised and unnecessarily duplicated enquiries before they can be resolved. Widespread ignorance about Aboriginal cultures allows ridiculous statements to be taken seriously, and moral posturing drowns out common sense.</PARA>
<PARA>The shadow minister claims that this legislation is unnecessary. He tells us that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) should be able simply to act to authorise the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. Opinions received by the government are to the contrary. Advice from a broad range of government bodies indicates that the minister either has to go back to a further inquiry that will cost another more than $1 million or else we have to bring in this legislation. Indeed, if this legislation is not carried by this parliament, well over $7 million will have been spent proving the right of the South Australian government and the developers to construct a bridge. The advice comes from the Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Government Solicitor and the Office of Indigenous Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite might have advice to the contrary, but the simple fact is that the government has received advice from very reputable legal sources. We are told that this legislation is necessary if we are to get the bridge to go ahead. People who were the original developers have gone broke because of delays. It has been found that the former government conspired with people who were prepared to do anything and say anything to prevent the bridge being constructed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to applaud the Aboriginal women who have been in the gallery today. They are people who have had the guts to stand up and say that they are sick and tired of their culture being fabricated. They are sick and tired of people being prepared to do anything and say anything to stop this bridge being constructed. Isn't it terrible that a certain number of people in society, including the former minister for Aboriginal affairs, were prepared to stoop to such a tactic? They treated Aboriginal beliefs with such contempt that they were prepared to manufacture Aboriginal beliefs to prevent this bridge from being constructed. In all the times the former minister for Aboriginal affairs was tested in a court, 19 judges out of 20 found that the former minister was not handling this area of Aboriginal affairs well at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole thrust of the debate that we have heard from the other side is that this legislation is not necessary. The shadow minister tells us that the minister should simply authorise the construction of the bridge. The minister is supposed to override the legal advice he has received. The shadow minister and the former minister have failed to tell us what would happen if the minister ignored all of the legal advice and proceeded to authorise the construction of the bridge. You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I know that this matter would simply end up once again in the courts. There would be a continuing legal mire. There would be enormous legal expenses built up. Cynical lawyers would continue to rip off the community. They would continue to rip off Aboriginal people. They would continue to trample over the rights of the women who had the guts to stand up and say that the so&hyphen;called secret women's business was absolutely fabricated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people on the other side have come into this place and opposed this legislation. Now, of course, they are virtually saying that the former minister was incompetent. They admit that the former government did not handle this matter well. But when we come forward with a proposal which is clear, which is concise, and which says once and for all, `Let's restore certainty,' they oppose this legislation. I think that indicates that they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6567"> really do not have the interests of Aboriginals at heart. When one looks at the shocking record of 13 years of Labor government in the area of Aboriginal affairs, one realises that it is absolutely hypocritical of them to be criticising this government and to be opposing this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 20&hyphen;odd years, Aboriginals have had some billions of dollars spent in the interests of their welfare. Most reasonable Australians do not oppose expenditure designed to improve Aboriginal health and Aboriginal housing or expenditure designed to reduce infant mortality problems and to improve educational standards. The attitude taken, though, by those opposite and the attitude taken by ATSIC in promoting the actions of former minister Tickner destroys the natural sympathy which most reasonable Australians have for the plight of Aboriginal people. It is appalling that people have the absolute hide to come in here and oppose what this government is doing. We have a program to redress Aboriginal needs. We aim to improve their health, we aim to improve their housing, we aim to improve their educational standards, we aim to make sure that ATSIC is more accountable, and we aim to make sure that moneys spent in the area of Aboriginal affairs attract the same level of accountability as other expenditure of government moneys. Yet every time that we try to do something to improve the plight of Aboriginal people, we find that those opposite, whose record is so dreadful, object to what we are seeking to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had I had more time I could have outlined some of the appalling elements of Labor's legacy to Aboriginals. Let me just mention briefly that, after 13 years, 14,000 dwellings are still required to meet Aboriginal housing needs in urban, rural and remote locations. In rural and remote areas, around 41,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live in such overcrowded conditions that they require additional housing. About 40 per cent of houses in rural and regional areas require major repair or replacement. That is only one area of Aboriginal affairs. I have got page after page that I could outline. But the fact of the matter is that the former government was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a failure. They were long on rhetoric and short on action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over a very long period of time they prevented the Hindmarsh Island Bridge from being constructed. We had five inquiries. Those five inquiries cost well over $6 million. The shadow minister would have us reject the legal advice we have received. He would have us simply override that legal advice. He would have the now minister authorise the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. Of course, at the end of the day, you know what would happen: the matter would go back before the court. There would be an injunction issued against the construction of the bridge. There would have to be yet another inquiry at a cost to the Australian taxpayerof more than $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government had these inquiries. They even sought to appoint Justice Mathews to conduct an inquiry. The court very clearly ruled that Justice Mathews had no right to be appointed. But even Justice Mathews pointed out in her report&mdash;which, of course, is no longer valid because her appointment was not valid&mdash;that there was no evidence that Aboriginal beliefs would be desecrated should the bridge be constructed. The report handed down by the royal commissioner in South Australia is very clear. I will obviously have to continue my speech when the House resumes, but I just want to point out in the minute or so available to me what the royal commissioner said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a fabrication of the women's business. The whole of the women's business was a fabrication. In particular, the claim that there was spiritual and cultural significance of Hindmarsh Island within the Aboriginal tradition of Ngarrindjeri women which was crucial for the reproduction of the Ngarrindjeri people and of the cosmos which supported their existence was fabricated. The claim that the women's business required the prohibition of the construction of the bridge was fabricated. The purpose of the fabrication was to obtain a declaration for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the honourable Robert Tickner MP to prevent the construction of a bridge between Goolwa and Hindmarsh Island.</PARA>
<PARA>We have had a situation where the Labor Party in office sought to frustrate the construction of this bridge. They were prepared to conspire, they were prepared to do any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6568"> thing, to prevent this bridge from being constructed. They were even prepared to trample on the sacred beliefs of Aboriginal people. I applaud those women who had the guts to say that they had had enough and that they did not in any way support what the Labor government tried to do.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tomorrow it seems certain that the clock will start ticking towards the end of many fundamental award conditions for Australian workers because the Senate will be considering amendments to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. As a result of the deal between the government and the Democrats, the Senate will undoubtedly pass section 89A of the bill and then consequential matters, following upon which there will be an 18&hyphen;month timetable before all award matters for Australian workers&mdash;except what are now 20 so&hyphen;called allowable matters&mdash;will disappear. All of those provisions will come under pressure from the proclamation of the bill. Any that survive the 18 months will disappear at the end of that period, unless workers can negotiate an agreement to win back conditions they already have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This change represents a threat to the security of working conditions for millions of Australian workers, particularly those who depend upon the award for their actual rather than merely their minimum conditions, which is about one&hyphen;third of Australian workers. It also represents a breach of two election promises which&mdash;silly us&mdash;we thought were probably even core promises, that is, the first promise that no worker will be worse off and the second that no worker would have their award conditions taken away under a Howard government. Mr Howard said in October last year that no Australian worker would have their award conditions taken away under a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Howard government, and the legislation directly does that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In case you thought that somehow or other the deal between the Australian government and the Democrats might have protected workers in this case, it is far from the truth. All that deal does is reduce by two the number of award conditions that will be lost. That did come as a surprise to many Australian workers, particularly those who heard Senator Kernot's speech to the Australian Education Union on 15 June when she quoted Mr Howard who had said, `No worker in Australia under the Howard industrial relations policy can have his or her award conditions taken away,' and then went on to criticise the bill saying it proposed stripping back awards to just 18 conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workers will lose access to dozens of current award entitlements on 15 June. Unfortunately, on 6 November, that is effectively what she is going to vote for&mdash;reducing those dozens of conditions by only two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has tried, from time to time, to come in here to trivialise the conditions which will be lost. Even those which he deems trivial are important to many workers in many places, but there are some very basic conditions and rights that are affected by these changes. I will seek the opportunity tomorrow to perhaps illustrate some more of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just refer this evening to the hospitality industry and its award. It is evident, on the face of it, that at least 16 conditions provided for under that award will disappear as a result of this legislation and the workers will have to seek to negotiate an agreement to win them back. People might argue about whether there are more that will be lost. That will be an interesting case before the commission. At least these 16 clearly will, including the section on sexual harassment and, in particular, subclause 14.1.2 of the award, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An employer shall not dismiss an employee on the grounds of refusal to dress in a manner which would cause that employee embarrassment.</PARA>
<PARA>What does that mean? That means bar staff cannot be forced to be topless by their employer under threat of the sack. That should <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6569"> destroy forever the idea that this process does anything about the interests of Australian women, protecting their rights and their dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What these changes overall mean for Australian workers, many of whom think they have already had too much enterprise bargaining, is that now they will have to enter into enterprise bargaining just to win back conditions they already have. The government, after promising the opposite, takes away their conditions and requires them to enter into enterprise bargaining just to stay where they are, let alone the greater hurdles that the bill puts in their way to seek to improve their conditions, to seek to improve their living standards. The workers of Australia, who are already suffering&mdash;as the Department of Industrial Relations report says&mdash;increased stress as a result of the pressures of enterprise bargaining, are no longer going to have the choice about whether they enter that bargain; they will be required to do so just to retain existing conditions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.35 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force was released. The report included 62 recommendations, largely aimed at freeing small business from the burden of government red tape. If a recent example of bureaucratic bungling concerning a small business in my electorate of Fairfax is any example of what operators have had to deal with, this report comes not a minute too soon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The incident to which I refer is an incredible example of vilification which has cost a small business in Fairfax valuable productivity hours as well as possibly damaging its reputation and goodwill. Last week, on Thursday, 31 October, the Killyptus Products Company, owned and operated by a husband and wife team on the Sunshine Coast, received a telephone call from their pet supplies distributor in Brisbane. To the horror of these small business owners, their distributor explained that one of their products had been removed from the shelves of retail outlets on the orders of a federal Department of Primary Industries and Energy inspector. They had <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> absolutely no idea and no warning that this was about to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, their first call was to the DPI in Brisbane. They asked why their product was being removed from the shelves of pet supply outlets and they asked the chief inspector to direct his DPI inspector in the field to stop his rounds until the position had been clarified. According to my constituent, the story then developed as follows. I quote from their letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He informed us that he had no way of contacting him in the field . . .</PARA>
<PARA>`Him' being the field inspector. The letter continues&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He then told me he would find out why the product was being removed and ring me back, which he did 15 minutes later. He said that he supported his officer because `we were on the NRA hit list'.</PARA>
<PARA>After discussions with the National Registration Authority, it was revealed that NRA patrols travel the country checking the wording on labels. As it turns out, an NRA representative had noticed the words `low irritant' on a bottle of their pet shampoo some 12 months earlier&mdash;a product which, by the way, has never been required to be registered with the NRA. The same label had been used by this business for five years and had not changed. It had previously been approved by the Queensland state Department of Primary Industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NRA then claimed that it had written to the business advising them of its concern and had received no reply. Interestingly enough, they had received regular correspondence from the NRA during the same period but this time the NRA wrote to a previous address on an old bottle. One section of NRA wrote to the correct address, another section to the incorrect address. The NRA officer then incorrectly assumed that their business had shut down and proceeded with the clearing of the shelves. This is nothing short of negligence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During their discussions with the NRA, my constituents claim that they were told that the words in question, `low irritant', posed a problem because the claim was something that could not be proven. They said that the argument used against them was, `Dogs do <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6570"> not talk, so how do you know it is low irritant?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, the NRA demanded that they remove all the products from the shelves of retail outlets and cross out the two words. Understandably, my constituents were stunned by this incredible suggestion. Finally, the NRA consulted a vet, and contacted the business owners the following day to advise that everything was okay after all and their product would be removed from the so&hyphen;called hit list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 24 hours a small business had its product removed from a pet shop retail outlet, had been told by a DPIE inspector that dogs do not talk, and then was advised that everything was okay. Well, it is not okay. I will not tolerate Gestapo style tactics being used on my constituents by bureaucratic Rambos hiding behind the legitimacy of legislation passed in the parliament. We promised to get small business back into business. We promised to cut red tape. The sooner we act on the recommendations of the task force the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This small business has had 13 years of this sort of rubbish and I am pleased to say that the government will act on this as it has already promised. I call on the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) to review the need for the NRA to exist or at least to investigate its operations through a parliamentary committee.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, while speaking on my private member's motion, I called on the members of this House to put away their political hatchets, jettison their political baggage and give serious consideration to the case for Goulburn as a site for Sydney's second airport&mdash;a site that, when serviced by the Sydney-Canberra very fast train, seems to me to make an awful lot of sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my time in this parliament, certainly during my 25 years of public life, I think I have been fairly up&hyphen;front. I would hope that I have treated members of the opposing parties with as much candour, sincerity and honesty as I have treated members of my own party. Yesterday, in my private member's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> speech, I asked for the same sincerity and candour to be shown by the government members to the motion I put forward. I did not insist that they agree with my proposition, merely that they approach it with open eyes and a clear mind and not dismiss it out of hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hughes (Mrs Vale), I am glad to see, was able to do so. I appreciated her comments made in the House last night and I warmly support her fight to move Sydney's second airport outside the Sydney basin, led most admirably by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). However, it was unfortunately not possible for the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit). Not only did he denigrate my suggestions with the politically biased rhetoric and thinking I had implored members to reject but he even questioned my reasons for starting the debate. The member for Lowe claimed not only that I had ulterior and malicious motives in putting forward my motion but also that the federal parliamentary Labor Party had colluded with me in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reject his slimy accusations. Not only do I reject them but I feel I must address them. The member for Lowe stated in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The underlying intention of the motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) is, without doubt, to limit Sydney to the one international airport&mdash;that is, KSA . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What absolutely unmitigated tripe! Sydney needs a second airport, a second airport which will go some way to relieving the people of Sydney of their intolerable aircraft noise burden. What I object to is the notion that this will best be achieved by building a second international airport on the doorstep of thousands of other Sydneysiders&mdash;be it at Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy&mdash;subjecting them to the same, if not worse, noise levels. I do not wish to delay the building of Sydney's second airport any more than the hopelessly misguided member for Lowe. I just do not want to see a repeat of the mistakes that have been made at Kingsford Smith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After he attacked my motives, the member for Lowe sought to challenge my argument with what he must believe passes as constructive debate. Unfortunately, the member for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6571"> Lowe, to the obvious embarrassment of members of his own party, only succeeded in exhibiting the fact that he entered this chamber thoroughly unburdened with the intelligence required to contribute to the discussion. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why does the honourable member stop at Goulburn? Why not throw in Wilton, Richmond, Newcastle and Wollongong?</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Lowe not only must have rocks in his head but must be as deaf as Helen Keller was blind. I suggest Goulburn as a site for the airport only in conjunction with a very fast train service which seems destined to be built between Sydney and Canberra, and possibly extended to Melbourne some time in the near future. Unless my geography is incorrect, Wilton, Richmond, Newcastle and Wollongong are not directly on the way to Canberra as Goulburn is. Perhaps the member for Lowe needs a new prescription for his glasses. Perhaps he just needs to go back to Geography 101.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lowe states that, because Goulburn finished last in the site selection process in 1985, any further suggestion that it should be looked at again is ludicrous. If my memory serves me correctly, Holsworthy finished second last in that site selection process in 1985 and yet it has not stopped the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) thinking it worthy enough to warrant further consideration. Again, the member for Lowe lets his dim light shine&mdash;dim being the operative word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lowe complains that a very fast train would cost $2.5 billion to build, implying that this extra cost would be borne by the government. What has the member for Lowe been doing for these last few months? The very fast train will be financed and operated by private business&mdash;at no cost to the government. It will employ hundreds of people; it will have many positive economic spin-offs. Do the member for Lowe and the government not want this project to go ahead?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what of his inane argument that you could not have a very fast train servicing an airport at Goulburn because families would have to spend hundreds of dollars catching <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the train to see them off at the airport? Oh please! Of course, they cannot say goodbye at the train station! That is just illogical, isn't it? Well, it is certainly too logical for the member for Lowe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also raises the bogus argument that Goulburn cannot be operated because the site is affected by fog approximately 50 days per year. My God, what does he think they do at Heathrow airport when a London peasouper rolls in&mdash;land the planes on Buckingham Palace? I ask the member for Lowe: what about the microwave landing system, or MLS, which will supersede instrument landing systems by the end of this decade, virtually making landing aircraft in poor conditions a non-issue? What about Lockheed Martin's autonomous precision approach and landing system which offers airlines the ability to operate in reduced visibility free of any dependence on ground based equipment? What about the CHURPs autopilot system presently being developed right here in Australia by BHP senior research scientist Dr David Stirling, which will revolutionise take-offs and landings by computer early next century?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lowe has shown time and time again in this House his incapacity to grasp an issue and make some sense of it. I know it must be hard for him, but for the sake of his constituents and the rest of Sydney who want a solution to the aircraft noise problem I do implore him to look hard enough within himself to find the intelligence which would enable him to make a constructive contribution to this debate. Otherwise, I suggest he stays in his office and continues to watch it on his TV set. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.45 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to place on record my deep concern for the Hawkesbury River system, which forms the southern boundary of my electorate of Robertson. The Hawkesbury River system is the longest river on the east coast of Australia, being some 460 kilometres in length. It has four name changes on its flow to the sea: starting at the Mulwarry Ponds, it becomes the Wollondilly, the Warra <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6572"> gamba, the Nepean and finally the Hawkesbury River.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a great affinity with this mighty river, having spent most of my life either playing in or working on the river. Even today I still live on the banks of this river. Unfortunately, I spend far too little time enjoying its beauty these days. I am not unique in claiming a long history with the Hawkesbury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This river has been a lifeline for the colony of Sydney and today it still supports a successful fishing and prawning industry hand in hand with the multimillion dollar Sydney rock oyster industry. There are many families who are third and fourth generation oyster farmers or fishermen on the river&mdash;families like the Buies, the Thompsons, the Johnsons, the Handys, the Singletons, the Davidsons, the Deas and many more who have made their living from the Hawkesbury River.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The river not only has supported these industries but is now a jewel in the crown of New South Wales tourism. Each weekend, thousands of Sydneysiders flock to the Hawkesbury River to swim, to fish&mdash;yes, the river still provides some of the best fishing around&mdash;to ski, to sail, to hire a houseboat, to enjoy a wonderful meal at one of the many restaurants in the area or just to sit and take in the breathtaking scenery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The river is the major fresh water supply for the city of Sydney. There are a number of dams and weirs being situated on the river. Major dams in the catchment include the Warragamba Dam on the Warragamba River, which is by far the largest. The Upper Nepean system also contains four dams: the Cataract Dam, the Cordeaux Dam, Avon Dam and the Nepean Dam. The Woronora system includes the Woronora Dam and the Prospect Reservoir. There are also four small dams in the Blue Mountains catchment area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Sydney has grown with its urban sprawl, particularly to the west and to the south-west, the environmental pressures being placed on the river system have become almost intolerable, particularly in the Nepean&hyphen;Upper Hawkesbury reaches. There are currently 21 sewage treatment plants operated by the Sydney Water Board in the Hawkesbury- <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Nepean catchment. In addition, there are 20 licensed sewage treatment plants in the catchment, although their combined loads are relatively small in comparison with those from Sydney Water Board's plants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an appalling situation. This magnificent river will not survive if we allow this ridiculous situation to continue. We cannot expect the Hawkesbury River system to absorb the urban run&hyphen;off and sewage outfall from most of Sydney without have a catastrophic effect on the water quality of the river. Thousands of people depend upon the Hawkesbury River for their livelihood and hundreds of thousands of others enjoy the amenities of the river each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The technology is available to improve the water quality. Companies such as Memtec based in Windsor lead the world in water microfiltration systems. Other companies such as Land and Marine Environmental Researchers have developed sophisticated monitoring equipment, such as stratacam, enabling instant data on sedimentation to be collected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already the river quality is improving. Tangible positive signs are appearing. Dolphins are again being seen in the river for the first time in many years. The fishing is improving. The prawn catches are larger and the future for the river will be bright if the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill and the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill are passed by the Senate, allowing funds to be used to continue the fight to restore this magnificent river.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Natural Heritage Trust is established, $85 million over five years will be provided to the national river care initiative. How can those in the other place who claim so loudly that they wish to protect our environment even consider not supporting the government's magnificent proposals to restore this and other waterways that are such an important part of our unique environment and contribute so much to our economy? I appeal to honourable senators to support the Telstra bill and provide the $1.15 billion to the Australian environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only regret I have about the debate last week on the bipartisan motion on racial tolerance was that not more than 11 members were able to participate. An even fuller debate than was possible would have revealed an even greater degree of unanimity of views than was possible in the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All members of this House bring to this place the experience of their upbringing and their life experiences. For all but the three years when I lived in the ACT I have lived in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, in suburbs which can be characterised as working class and in suburbs which are characterised by their high migrant population. I consider that I had within those communities a privileged upbringing. My father was the local GP, who became the local state MP and then became the local federal member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, essentially, the electorate of Scullin has many characteristics that set it apart from other electorates. It essentially epitomises many of the positive characteristics of Australia. The analysis by the Parliamentary Library based on the 1991 census reveals that 36 per cent of the electorate of Scullin were born overseas, that some 21 per cent of the population were born in southern Europe&mdash;the major source countries being Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece&mdash;and that some 4.4 per cent of the population were born in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An even clearer illustration of the ethnic diversity of the electorate of Scullin is exemplified by the languages that are spoken at home&mdash;52.3 per cent of people live in homes where only English is spoken; therefore, in nearly 48 per cent of homes other languages are spoken. The major languages are: Italian, 14 per cent; Macedonian, 10 per cent; and Greek, seven per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can understand that for a community with that degree of diversity to function properly a great degree of tolerance has to be shown. I believe that the electorate of Scullin, as a microcosm of Australia, shows that through the development of the values we hold so dear, which were epitomised by the agreement to the motion on racial tolerance in this place last week, we can build on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> strengths of cultural diversity in a tolerant and open society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It can also be illustrated that those people who live in such communities can show a great degree of loyalty not only to their families, not only to their local communities, not only to their ethnic backgrounds but also to their adopted country, Australia. It is with great worry that, as evidenced by the present debate that has been generated, for whatever reasons, the type of tolerance that we have learnt to live with should be questioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The range and diversity of the electorate I live in is also illustrated by the religious background of the people. The major religions in my electorate are Catholic, 39.5 per cent, and Orthodox, 18.5 per cent. I was a member of the local council when the local Islamic community put in an application to start a community centre. That community centre has now developed into a fully fledged mosque. At the time, because it was different, some people queried whether they could learn to live with a functioning mosque. If one visits Thomastown now and sees the magnificent building that is the mosque, one can understand that that mosque was able to function because of the tolerance that abounds in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people within the electorate number only 275. If you look at the wage ranges of the people of Scullin they could consider themselves to be in the disadvantaged income bracket. When people look at the plight of Aboriginal people they know that they are at an even greater disadvantage, and they are willing to ensure that those needs are addressed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

There are a lot of other organisations in my electorate that tried very hard to get funding from the Australia Council to support very worthy activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It concerns me that unions are taking advantage of this. I would suggest that in the future we need to have a look at this very closely. I am sure there were far more worthy recipients. I hope that in the next round of allocated grants organisations like the ones in my electorate that I have mentioned will be given priority over trade unions.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even though I might describe it a sham that there is a greater degree of freedom of speech, I feel provoked by the comments of the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about some of the grants made by the Australia Council to make some remarks. I think the comments of the honourable member for Leichhardt are based on the premise that workers should not be involved in culture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, like he does, have some trouble from time to time with what the Australia Council may or may not grant. In fact, from questions on notice I have asked or from information I have tried to get from the Australia Council, there has only ever been one grant to an individual from the electorate of Scullin over the last three or four years. But what the honourable member has to understand is that the Australia Council operates at arm's length. The Australia Council, in funding some of those projects sponsored by unions, has ensured that working&hyphen;class Australians have had exposure to many forms of culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the things that have been funded by the Australia Council have allowed culture to be brought into the workplace&mdash;poetry at lunch times, things like that. What is the difficulty? The member for Leichhardt scoffs. Why not have the exposure? In the absence of these grants from the Australia Council some of the people I represent in this place, the battlers of Australia, would have no exposure and no opportunity to enjoy the riches of culture that Australia can provide. He should not scoff at those types of things.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 11 September 1996:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Is Australia a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Is he able to say what Article 14(3)(d) of the ICCPR states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Has his attention been drawn to the High Court case of Dietrich v. The Queen (1992), in particular, the High Court's finding that the courts possess undoubted power to stay criminal proceedings which will result in an unfair trial, the right to a fair trial being a central pillar of our criminal justice system and that the power to grant a stay necessarily extends to a case in which representation of the accused by counsel is essential to a fair trial, as it is in most cases in which an accused is charged with a serious offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Does he support the finding of the High Court in its decision referred to in part (3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Has the Government reduced its legal aid budget by the sum of $33m each year for three years from July 1997; if so, will this lead to a drastically underfunded and ineffective legal aid system in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Is it a fact that Government cuts to its legal aid budget will lead to a situation where persons will (a) seek an indefinite stay of their trial on the basis of the High Court's ruling in Dietrich v. The Queen (1992) that individuals suffering from inadequate legal representation, and therefore having no access to a fair trial, have a right to have their trials stayed, since insufficient legal aid funding will force legal practitioners to withdraw their representation from cases when funding for an individual's case is exhausted, (b) conclude their court actions early or (c) represent themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Did the Standing Committee of State Attorneys-General at its last meeting before the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6604"> federal Budget present a united front against the cuts to Commonwealth funding to legal aid; if so, what is his response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Has his attention been drawn to recent comments made by the Victorian Attorney-General, Mrs J. Wade, the former President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, the former Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr B. Bongiorno QC and the Managing Director of the NSW Legal Aid Commission, Mr M. Cramsie, all alerting the Government to the inequities that will develop in Australian society and the legal system should the cuts in Commonwealth funding for legal aid go ahead; if so, what is his response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) Are the reservations expressed in parts (7) and (8) by those individuals, all from different political backgrounds and all with extensive legal experience, indicative of a general apprehensiveness and concern within the legal profession regarding the Government's decision to cut its legal aid budget.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Article 14(3)(d) of the ICCPR states the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled to the following minimum guarantees, in full equality:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance assigned to him, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any such case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Government acknowledges the decision in Dietrich v. The Queen and is working with the States and Territories to develop legislation to deal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the impact of the decision on the provision of legal aid services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Commonwealth believes that a proper apportionment of responsibility for legal aid between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories will lead to a reduced requirement for Commonwealth funding. This will mean the Commonwealth's contribution will be reduced annually by $33.158m. It is a matter for each State and Territory to meet its funding responsibility for its legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) It is not possible to predict whether any of the situations outlined in the honourable member's question will occur. The Commonwealth will meet its obligations for those charged with criminal offences under Commonwealth legislation. It is a matter for each State and Territory to meet its obligations for legal aid funding for those charged with criminal offences under State or Territory law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) At their meeting on 12 July 1996, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, noting the Commonwealth's dissent, endorsed the following resolution:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, recognising that those people for whom the Commonwealth has traditionally had a special responsibility&mdash;the unemployed, recipients of pensions and other Commonwealth benefits, students, migrants, aboriginal people and veterans&mdash;must receive the highest priority in any such review, regardless of the different legal responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States, so that people in need are not disadvantaged by any changes in the arrangements for funding legal aid, resolves that any changes to legal aid funding should be based on guidelines to be developed by State and Commonwealth Attorneys-General in conjunction with meetings of SCAG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My response is that the Commonwealth is no longer willing to subsidise State law matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) I am aware of the recent comments by those mentioned in the honourable member's question. The Commonwealth believes that a proper apportionment of responsibility for legal aid between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories will lead to a reduced requirement for Commonwealth funding. I understand that Mr Bernard Bongiorno QC addressed a meeting at the Fitzroy Town Hall on 11 August 1996. In his address he said that it was not sufficient for State Ministers to blame the Commonwealth, but that the primary responsibility for legal aid lay with the State Government which should pick up the shortfall in funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) There may be some concern in the community and the legal profession over the Government's action to change legal aid funding arrangements. It is to be expected that people who are concerned <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6605"> about access to justice for those in need in the community would have a view on this issue. The changes that the Government has announced will ensure that the legal assistance for matters arising under Commonwealth law will be maintained, and will no longer be subject to the pressures faced by legal aid commissions from an increasing demand to provide assistance for criminal matters which mostly arise under State and Territory laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In future it will be for State and Territory governments to decide what approach to take to deal with the issue instead of relying on what has been, in effect, a Commonwealth subsidy for State and Territory law matters.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Strehlow collection consists in large part of highly secret&hyphen;sacred objects collected earlier this century by the late Professor T.G.H.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of Mr Hollis' previous question in August 1995 drawn&hyphen;out negotiations between Dr Strehlow and the Central Land Council (CLC) had led to an agreement for the sale of the retained component of the collection to the CLC.</PARA>
