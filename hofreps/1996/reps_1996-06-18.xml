Does the Treasurer recall stating last Friday that the new wholesale sales tax on state car purchases will apply from the date of his first press release on this issue&mdash;last Tuesday, 11 June? Is he aware that, as a result of the government's failure to publish in newspapers today the public notice required within seven days by section 130B of the Sales Tax Assessment Act, any collection of the tax would be in breach of that statutory requirement?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. He has a well&hyphen;known interest in these matters. Indeed, I have seen the reports and it is quite notable&mdash;and many members would know&mdash;that Australians pay significantly more for CDs than many other countries, particularly the United States. In the arts policy which was released prior to the election by my colleague Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">For Arts Sake&mdash;A Fair Go!</EMPHASIS> , we committed ourselves to looking for ways to lower those prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said we would consult widely with both the industry and more broadly with the community about how that might most effectively be done, that is, to get to that aim of lower prices. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is in fact doing formal price monitoring at present. They are about to release their first report. We look forward to that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that this is a priority issue for the government and we do want to find a mechanism where we can get better prices for consumers, but also provide a stable environment for the industry in which to provide its services. The government is determined to try to seriously address this matter, which has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bedevilled the now opposition for some years, to find a meaningful solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know if the honourable member has actually seen the press release by Shock Records only this week, but I am pleased to say that it indicates that they have just announced that they will reduce the price of the top ten CD titles in Australia down to $25 from an average of $31. Polygram Records have also followed suit. So there is some movement now in terms of prices for the top titles. The government welcomes that move, but as I say we will be monitoring it closely. We will be consulting with the ACCC and also widely with the industry to get to the position where the government needs to be to see lower prices for consumers.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V5">Mr SLIPPER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House how the government is assisting demutualisation in the financial sector? What are the benefits of demutualisation for the consumer?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2056" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Demutualisation in the finance industry results in improvements in ownership, it introduces the market mechanism for takeover and it provides the opportunity for the raising of additional capital by way of equity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have recently agreed in principle to facilitate a proposal arising out of the demutualisation of Colonial Mutual. Colonial Mutual has purchased the State Bank of New South Wales and, as a condition of that, was required to demutualise. The acquisition has resulted in a merged business where the banking and insurance arms are of comparable size. There are regulatory advantages in allowing the two branches of the business to be run by the one holding company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The takeover of the Bank of New South Wales by Colonial Mutual was done under a longstanding arrangement, a facility which allowed a holding company to take over a bank where the holding company was an Australian non&hyphen;mutual life. In order to  take advantage of that policy, Colonial Mutual was required to demutualise and, in order to facilitate that demutualisation in the new structure, approval has been given to the holding company structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will introduce legislation at a later stage to provide a more direct means of achieving regulation of the holding company, but I want to emphasise that this is a one&hyphen;off exception made in exceptional circumstances. Before the Wallace inquiry into the financial system reports, we will not be allowing other holding companies to be set up to own current insurance businesses together with banking businesses should any of the six&mdash;or indeed seven&mdash;major players wish to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adopt a similar structure. This is a one&hyphen;off in exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make it clear, however, that the government welcomes competition in the financial industry. It believes that there are enormous advantages from new entrants into the financial industry. With variable mortgage rates, we have seen reductions as a result of new entrants and new competition, and the government believes that, by improving the opportunity for new entrants and for more competition, it will be delivering the best results to consumers, both to home buyers and to small businesses, who have red&hyphen;hot, full&hyphen;blooded competition in the financial sector which will ultimately be to their benefit.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I remind the Deputy Prime Minister of the coalition's election promise not to increase taxes and charges. I refer to the report today that the Queensland government has decided to slug my fellow Queenslanders $190 million extra next year through a household poll tax. Do you understand why Premier Borbidge felt betrayed by the Howard government at last week's Premiers Conference? Apart from that betrayal, doesn't this represent another tax increase by a coalition government in clear breach of your election promise not to increase taxes and charges?

They can be provided for only by legislation of the state parliaments. On the matter of taxation&mdash;and since the 2 March election&mdash;I was hoping the supplementary might have been allowed because I happen to have a piece from a newspaper here which has as its heading `Labor split over GST'. As the left wing goes its merry way in the aftermath of your massive defeat, Labor ranks are split over the services tax. Indeed, you seem to have forgotten that your own caucus is very divided on the question of taxation reform.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dare I mention it? You wanted to be the Secretary&hyphen;General, didn't you? I was constantly asked by the media whether we would support the member for Holt for the position of Secretary&hyphen;General of the United Nations. As the member for Holt quite rightly points out, I was very gracious. I always try to be gracious. I simply quoted the words of the member for Holt. I read them in a profile on the member for Holt when he said that he enjoyed being the shadow Treasurer and that he quite enjoys his time in opposition. I would not want to get in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the way of that. If you would like to come and have a talk to me about one of the undersecretary&hyphen;general positions, we would be quite happy to consider that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am digressing, though, because the real issue here is Australia being elected to the United Nations Security Council. I am cautiously optimistic about Australia's chances. We certainly have very strong support from the Pacific island countries and the east Asian region, from the Caribbean and the Gulf Cooperation Council. We still have more work to do with African countries and more work to do in Europe, including central and eastern Europe. But the simple argument that Australia can put&mdash;that the other two candidates are both European Union candidates and Australia obviously is not&mdash;is, in my view, a very strong argument for us to put.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The European Union already has two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and it also has two of the non-permanent positions&mdash;the two for the West Europe and Others Group at the moment. For the United Nations General Assembly to elect two more EU members for the next two years to the non-permanent West Europe and Others Group seats I think would be a major mistake. I do not think the West Europe and Others Group representation on the Security Council should be dominated by the European Union&mdash;no objection to the European Union, but I do not think the council should be dominated by the European Union. It is very important, therefore, that Australia win this election, and the government will work hard to ensure that we do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this is like any election campaign: you do not know ultimately what the outcome is going to be. There are still some four months to go until the vote takes place, and we will need to work very hard throughout that time on the other members of the United Nations to get the requisite two-thirds vote.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the minister seen a report that the opposition will not oppose the union disamalgamation provisions of the workplace relations bill? Would such a position be consistent with Labor's overall approach to the bill?</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2058" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I must say that, when I read the reports this morning of further amendments from the Labor opposition, I could only come to the conclusion that the confusion continues within their ranks. I was interested because it was only a couple of days ago that the number of amendments we could look forward to was around 200, but this morning it has grown to the precise number of 291. I can only assume that their confusion is so great that they are now amending their amendments before they bring them into the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this latest set apparently they are supporting superunions and amalgamations to achieve them but they are also supporting disamalgamations&mdash;so we have them getting bigger, getting smaller. They are supporting the retention of the conveniently belong rule, but at the same time if that does not work they want a complete open slather. They really are all over the place. They seem to have a lot of problems coming to grips with some of the essential issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is any problem in publishing their amendments, I think we would be prepared to help. The government's bill is on the Internet. We have had 60,000 hits on the Internet in terms of people looking at our bill. I think a lot of people would be interested to know about Labor's amendments. So I challenge the honourable member for Canberra, if he has some amendments, whether the number is 291 or perhaps 334 by tomorrow, to let us have them by 5 o'clock. If he likes, we will put them up on the Internet for everybody to see and we can pore over them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More seriously, though, it is in contrast to the government's position on disamalgamation and coverage issues, where our policy position is based on two very commonsense rules&mdash;firstly, simply that workers have a right to be in a union of their choice and, secondly, that businesses have a right to have effective redress when their business is being threatened by unsanctioned industrial action. It seems from the reports that the shadow minister's view is that, if a business and its employees are being threatened by industrial action and where that industrial action may <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2059"> lead to unemployment, then as a result of a demarcation dispute the business must go to the wall, that there should be no effective means of redress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is even further confusion because it is usually the position of the opposition that the Industrial Relations Commission should be the umpire to decide these issues. Yet, on one of the shadow minister's secret and mysterious amendments, the commission would have no such power. He really ought to make up his mind: which way is it going to be; what exactly is his position? I think the best way for him to perhaps come to grips with some of these issues is to release these amendments so that there can be fair public debate about them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two other things need to be said which I think evidence the shadow minister's difficulty in coming to grips with these issues. He is wrong on a couple of points. He is critical of the idea of autonomy for union branches. But the fact of the matter is that that is not a new concept. If he knew his current act better, he would know that it was required by the Conciliation and Arbitration Act back in 1904 and, in fact, it was provided for in Labor's own legislation. Our bill simply gives real effect to that proposition. But it is, however, an old concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point where he is particularly wrong is in the proposals the government has with subsection 118(a) and the right of people to choose the union in which they are members. The section relates to coverage, not to membership. So it would be open, for example, for a worker at a site covered by a particular union to appoint another union as their agent to negotiate an Australian workplace agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, in fact, support the right of people to be in a union, and we back it up. But one of the real differences between our policy position and the opposition's policy is that we seek to protect the rights of individual workers. What they do is seek to protect union power to the disadvantage of workers. It is about time he released his secret amendments.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I refer to that oft repeated claim during the election campaign by the coalition that there would be no new taxes and no increase in taxes. I ask the Deputy Prime Minister: in view of those amateurish shambles represented by the Premiers Conference which took place last week, and the fact that New South Wales residents will be subjected to a tax increase of $900 million over the next three years&mdash;and that represents an increase for every family of $300 over the next three years&mdash;does that represent an increase in taxes under this coalition government?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far we have had Queensland, Tasmania and New South Wales. We are now going to get Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria to follow. The answer is the same: Labor has no credibility on the matter of taxation. Labor has absolutely no credibility. The reason for that is what you did after the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with the member for Charlton in welcoming our American friends. Indeed, if our American government friends whom I had the privilege to meet a couple of hours ago knew the full story, they would advise the same conclusion; namely, in the 1993 elections, then Labor Treasurer Dawkins said that there would be no new taxes and no tax increases. The first budget you produced after the 1993 elections increased taxes in four areas, particularly with regard to fuel excise tax.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make it entirely clear that, as far as this government is concerned, if matters come to light where exemptions are being used improperly to avoid the application of the taxation system, we will fix it. In relation to the wholesale sales tax, I direct the attention of the House to a release by the Motor Trades Association of Australia which was put out on 11 June 1996. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many years, MTAA has adopted as its policy that steps should be taken to eliminate the use of sales tax exemptions for the purpose of minimising income tax. Representations to the previous Labor government on the matter did not even receive the courtesy of an acknowledgment.</PARA>
<PARA>The release continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a sensible and worthwhile reform of an area of taxation administration that has become the subject of very significant tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA>Not even the courtesy of a reply. You were a government that presided over taxation avoidance and you would do nothing about it. I refer the House also to part of the September 1995 newsletter by the Auto Industry of Australia entitled, `The unfair advantage for council car trader'. It says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chamber&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has recently been made aware of a bid by the City of Whitehorse, formerly Box Hill and Nunawading in Melbourne, to obtain a motor car traders licence. If the motor car traders licence is granted, the council will be selling vehicles it bought sales tax exempt and with fleet discounts.</PARA>
<PARA>You were prepared to preside over a system where councils were able to get motor car licences. The newsletter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A local newspaper report on the matter in part noted: `The council already makes a profit on the sale of many of its cars because they are bought free of sales tax and sold at the normal retail price while still in good condition. But the council estimates it can make an extra $2,000 to $3,000 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> profit on each car by selling them direct to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>No government could allow a situation where councils took out motor car licences to take advantage of sales tax exemptions to engage in motor car trading. As the Motor Trades Association said, this was unfair competition. This was an exemption which, in relation to the application of the taxation system, was unfair. This is an exemption which the Labor Party refused to do anything about because you loved this area of tax avoidance. I take it you are still opposed to closing it down. Is that right? Are you opposed to closing it down? You can't even announce a position on this because you know that to announce a position on this would expose the failures you had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any state government that takes the opportunity to raise its taxes takes that responsibility for itself, and it is responsible. If they want to say there is any federal contribution in relation to their taxation regime, they can lay the blame with the person who is really responsible&mdash;the Beazley black hole. As the Prime Minister said, a Carr tax out of Beazley.</PARA>

But I make it very clear that we are proceeding with the completion of the privatisation of the Commonwealth Development Bank. That, of necessity, meant decisions had to be taken with regard to the particular arrangements which existed between the federal government and the Commonwealth Development Bank. We have dealt with that as a government. I strongly defend the commitment that has been provided with regard to the loan arrangements of the Commonwealth Development Bank.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of this House must remember that it was the previous Labor government that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2063"> instituted the inequitable, unfair and distressing Bennelong funnel that caused so much distress in Sydney.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. I draw the minister's attention to the UNICEF report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The progress of nations 1996</EMPHASIS> . The report found that Australia has an overall child poverty rate of 10 per cent and that more than 50 per cent of Australian children <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2066"> in sole parent families are living below the poverty line. Can the minister detail what action the government is taking to address this appalling and shameful situation?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2066" SPEAKER="Moylan, Judi, MP" NAMEID="4V5" ELECTORATE="Pearce" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Family Services" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4V5">Mrs MOYLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Makin for that question. The findings of the report are a damning indictment of Labor's commitment as enunciated by former Prime Minister Bob Hawke when he declared that no Australian child shall live in poverty by 1990. It is a fact that under Labor there has been a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor and a decline of 25 per cent in the number of households in Australia earning between $22,000 and $72,000 per annum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is there has also been a doubling of the number of people earning less than $22,000 per annum. Unemployment and family dislocation are two of the principal causes of growing poverty and of growing social inequality in our community. Younger single people, some of whom live in neighbourhoods where unemployment has exceeded 50 per cent, now make up 25 per cent of all Australians living in poverty. This is not to mention those of the indigenous population for whom employment is not an option in many parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now there is also Labor's legacy of 600,000 Australian children who live in families with income levels below $22,000 per annum. As the member for Makin has quite rightly pointed out, many of these children come from sole parent families&mdash;Labor's legacy. The report findings are a sad testimonial to 13 years of economic mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, this government is committed to the most significant family tax initiatives this country has ever seen. This initiative is targeted at lower and middle income earners, many of whom found it increasingly difficult to make ends meet under the Labor government, as the UNICEF report has quite rightly pointed out. Our policy will mean an extra $21 per week for a single income family of five on average weekly earnings, with at least one child under five.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the Prime Minister has recognised homeless youth as a particularly vulnerable group in our community and has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> implemented the homeless youth task force to address this growing problem. This is a practical policy, a practical reform, that will reduce the vulnerability of those young people&mdash;and there are some 20,000 of them every night in this country who have to seek shelter and who are, essentially, homeless youth. That is an indictment of 13 years of Labor's policy. Our government's approach is action, not rhetoric and humbug.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset how regrettable it is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has decided to absent himself from the chamber for this debate on what is an extraordinarily important issue for the parliament and indeed for all of Australia. It indicates a certain cavalier and irresponsible attitude on his part. I dare say it is entirely consistent with the approach he took yesterday in his thinly veiled attack on the integrity of Richard Woolcott, the Chairman of the Australia-Indonesia Institute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All honourable members are aware that the United Nations has declared this year, 1996, as the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. No member of this House should question the necessity for intensifying our international efforts and making every effort possible to eliminate poverty and to alleviate social injustice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Australian Council for Overseas Aid declares in its submission on this year's overseas aid budget, the persistence of hunger and extreme poverty is the most profound moral and spiritual contradiction of our age. Despite 50 years of great achievement by international foreign aid programs, the gap today between rich and poor continues to grow. Today, in this age of immense economic and technological accomplishment, more than 1.3 billion people survive on an income <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2075"> of less than $1 a day and are denied their basic rights of health, education, shelter, clean water supply and sanitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Five hundred million of the world's 800 million most needy people live in the Asia-Pacific region; that is, they live in our region. I put it to the House that the problem of global poverty and social injustice is right here on our doorstep and we as a nation cannot turn our backs against it. It is against that backdrop that the Minister for Foreign Affairs last month established an independent review of Australia's overseas aid programs. In making his announcement, the minister rightly said that Australia has an overseas aid program of which all Australians can be proud. He put this on the record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Millions of people around the world are now better off thanks to the help they've received from Australia. Our aid program, administered by AusAID and delivered by Australian companies, individuals, non-government organisations and academic institutions is highly effective.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he announced the review. For our part, the opposition welcomed the establishment of the review, chaired as it is by Mr Paul Simons, the former executive chairman of Woolworths. It is our view that, in ever changing international circumstances, the continuous review of Australia's overseas aid program is crucially important for maximising its effectiveness and for making sure that we maintain its primary focus of contributing to lasting poverty reduction whilst also serving Australia's international interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although many individual Australian aid programs and projects have been subject to comprehensive review down through the years, it is now some years since the Jackson report on Australia's overall aid program. We readily agreed that the new review established by the government is an appropriate and timely one to take place in this International Year for the Eradication of Poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Minister for Foreign Affairs declined to mention when he announced his review was that, as a consequence of the government's ruthless slash and burn approach to the aid budget, Australia's commitment to provide development assistance and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to alleviate poverty in and beyond our region is about to fall to its lowest level in more than 20 years; that is, it will fall to below 0.3 per cent of one per cent of our gross national product. As I pointed out when the minister made his announcement, any review will be a farce if the job of the review team is simply to pick up the pieces after the government has taken the axe to our overseas aid programs. Alternatively, the real purpose of the review may be just that: to work out what might be done with a greatly reduced aid budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On our side of the House, we are proud that Labor increased aid spending in real terms in each of our last six budgets. In 1995-96, we provided just over $1.5 billion; that is, 0.33 per cent of GNP. That is a proportionate decline only because of the rapid growth of the Australian economy, but it is a real increase in dollar terms and a substantial improvement on the OECD average of 0.3 of one per cent. That is the truth of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, Australia was one of only four OECD donor countries to increase its aid budget in real terms. We did it year after year and we are immensely proud of it. In the lead-up to this year's federal election, the coalition publicly reiterated its support for the bipartisan UN goal of applying 0.7 per cent of GNP to overseas aid. For Australia to meet our international obligations and show Australia's international good citizenship, the government must demonstrate a serious commitment to achieving the UN target with, at the very least, annual real increases in the aid program as urged by ACFOA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of the development improvement finance facility program was announced by the coalition during the election campaign long before any fatuous talk about budget black holes. If the money saved by the abolition is removed from the overall aid program rather than redirected to other parts of the program, it will represent a 7.9 per cent cut to Australia's aid program. That will be the first time that we will have seen Australia's overseas aid program fall to below 0.3 per cent of one per cent. It will have fallen to 0.29 per cent of GNP. It will be the first time in history that our Australian aid level has fallen below the weighted OECD average. No <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2076"> responsible or moral Australian would regard such an outcome as anything other than a national disgrace and a grave embarrassment for a country whose closest neighbours in Asia and the South Pacific are overwhelmingly developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The foreign affairs minister has spoken at length about the need to respond to humanitarian concerns. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has promised to protect the needy against his government's budget cuts, but those words clearly count for nothing when the foreign minister has already axed the DIFF scheme without any reallocation of funds to other programs. Indeed, he is reported to have accepted the need for further aid cuts as deep as 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is perhaps most astonishing is the preparedness of the government to proceed on this course of action, which is so contrary to its stated commitment to achieve lasting poverty reduction and is so detrimental to our regional engagement. The across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board axing of DIFF funded aid programs without any evaluation of the merits of individual programs or recognition of the serious consequences for Australia has received near universal condemnation. It has been condemned universally both at home and abroad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks to the government's actions, Australia now faces a major regional backlash and serious damage to our international credibility as our neighbours are forced to cancel important development projects, including programs for the provision of clean water and electricity in rural and remote areas. In many cases, the recipient countries have already invested significant funds themselves. Those investments have been made on the assumption of the good faith of the Australian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In eastern Indonesia, for example, 21 regional laboratories will not now be equipped with Australian scientific equipment for environmental monitoring, including water quality monitoring on five major rivers, despite the fact that the principal Australian supplier has in the last 18 months invested more than $1.3 million in the project with the written encouragement of the Australian government. The Indonesian government itself has expended more than $500,000 to upgrade <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the laboratories to operate the new Australian equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Across the region, our neighbours are being told that understandings reached in good faith count for nothing in the calculations of the new Australian government. It is little wonder that China, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines have all made official protests through their ambassadors and at our embassies throughout the region. As I pointed out in question time today, the Chinese ambassador has left the government in no doubt that the scrapping of DIFF projects in China will do Australia no good in terms of our credibility or business interests. Representations have been made by the Chinese government, irrespective of whether the minister admits it, at a vice&hyphen;ministerial level on at least four occasions. They have sought a reversal of the government's decision to cut over 50 per cent of Australia's aid to China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Similarly, the Philippines ambassador has stated publicly that the decision to scrap DIFF creates a perception that Australia was not serious in its engagement in the region, while senior Indonesian officials in Jakarta have said Australia is `shooting itself in the foot' by scrapping DIFF. In eastern Indonesia this is most certainly the case. The 21 environmental monitoring laboratories that I mentioned earlier were to be equipped by Australian companies. That work will now almost certainly go to Japanese competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only yesterday, here in this chamber, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No country is more central to Australia's drive into Asia than Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said. But with the axing of DIFF, Japanese scientific equipment will become the benchmark for environmental monitoring in Indonesia, and Australia will effectively be locked out of this key export market. So much for the often boasted engagement by the new government of the clever country of Australia in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is very hard to see the logic of the decision to scrap DIFF. It is absolutely impossible to see the logic as it affects the 52 individual projects in the DIFF pipeline. The comprehensive effectiveness review of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2077"> program, the one conducted by AusAID with the assistance of independent consultants, released only in January this year, found that the vast majority of the projects carried out under DIFF contributed to the overall economic and social advancement of the recipient countries and met the primary objectives of our aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, the review found that DIFF had generated substantial commercial benefits for Australia. Almost all firms surveyed stated that DIFF had been important to their business, with half stating that it was either crucial or very important to their operations. Combined with funding from the Export Finance Insurance Corporation, the 51 projects examined in the review&mdash;involving some $285 million of AusAID funds&mdash;generated direct project expenditure in Australia worth $709 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, follow-up business already won by the companies and directly related to the original DIFF project was estimated at $263 million, and the firms predicted a further $397 million of follow-on business to be achieved over the year following the survey. Total business generated as a result of the projects is therefore estimated at $1.37 billion or almost five times the original aid expenditure. For many Australian companies a DIFF project was also their first overseas contract. As a consequence, they changed their focus from solely concentrating on our domestic market to including a significant export orientation in their activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For every dollar invested in DIFF, Australia received a fivefold return while contributing directly to long-term alleviation of poverty and economic development in the region. Unfortunately, however, DIFF is no more, though the government&mdash;and it is no surprise&mdash;has told companies that it may consider the establishment of a similar arrangement in the future. In the meantime, however, total Australian commercial losses on the projects in the DIFF pipeline resulting from the government's decision are estimated to exceed $67 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In the case of the high&hyphen;technological environmental monitoring project in eastern Indonesia, no less than 67 Australian com panies&mdash;almost all of them small and medium size business&mdash;are counting their losses. Across the country some 600 subcontractors are estimated to be affected&mdash;a state of affairs which makes an absolute mockery of the Prime Minister's statement that the government supports small and medium business. There is little wonder that the decision to scrap DIFF has been universally condemned by Australian businessmen and by such commentators as Bert Evans of the Metal Trades Industry Association, who described its abolition as `foolish' and as `the most short&hyphen;sighted thing' he had seen in his career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, Australia had an aid program which produced win-win outcomes. We achieved real and lasting benefits for the people and nations of our region. We lifted living standards, provided long-term solutions to the problems of poverty, disease, malnutrition, lack of access to education and basic services. We gave substance to our growing regional engagement and contributed directly and substantially to our bilateral relations with our friends and neighbours. It was good for the Australian economy and good for Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, tragically, we are caught in a lose-lose situation. Crucial aid projects are, at this very moment, being cancelled with grave consequences for the recipient regions and their communities. ACFOA hit the nail on the head in saying that slashing the aid budget and abolishing DIFF sends all the wrong signals to our neighbours. At the same time, the impact on Australian jobs has aroused condemnation from a coalition of opinion including business, aid organisations, union leaders, conservative state premiers and ordinary Australians who believe our nation should play its part and pull its weight. The government stands condemned for its short&hyphen;sighted and miserly approach on this important policy issue&mdash;the approach described very fairly by one leading foreign policy commentator as `dumb, dumb, dumb'.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose it is one of the cruelest ironies of this debate that the gentleman who probably knows the most <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2078"> about developmental cooperation and aid matters is not here to lead this MPI for the opposition. Mr Gordon Bilney was the previous member for Kingston and Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, and as he sits on his yacht pondering the reasons for his defeat and who to blame for it, I wonder if his mind might venture as far as the honourable gentleman from Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). The irony is cruelest in Mr Bilney's case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This MPI is specifically about the abolition of the DIFF&mdash;the development import finance facility. In answering the honourable gentleman's allegations and criticisms, I point out very bluntly that yes, we said during the election campaign that this would be abolished and yes, it does amount to an eight per cent cut in the total aid budget. We said that before the election. We said it very clearly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look back at what the opposition's record was when it was in government, as far back as 1993, when Mr Kerin&mdash;a fine gentleman and the predecessor in the seat of my friend the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham)&mdash;was the minister responsible for the aid budget. He promised during the 1993 election campaign that the then government would lift the aid budget as a percentage of Australia's GNP from 0.36 per cent to 0.4 per cent during the period 1993 to 1996, where we find ourselves today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said at the time that such a commitment could not be believed or trusted and, of course, he denied that. But the fact is that, under Labor, the aid budget fell from 0.36 per cent to 0.33 per cent in the period from 1993 to 1996. If we go back to February this year, we find that Labor did it again. This time it was Senator Evans&mdash;Senator Gary Evans as he is to be known henceforth, or Mr Gary Evans, the member for Holt&mdash;who said in a prepared speech that he delivered on 23 February&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) was the shadow minister for points of order, but you seem to be claiming some of his territory. I will henceforth refer to him as the member for Holt. He read a prepared speech to a forum put on by Community Aid Abroad&mdash;sponsors, I might add, of today's great national day of action. In promoting its national day of action and fomenting a protest in front of the national parliament, how many people did it attract? Twenty! There were 20 people at the Community Aid Abroad's national day of action protest outside the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back to the member for Holt: he said in this prepared speech that he committed the Labor Party to increasing the aid budget, again as a percentage of GNP, from 0.33 per cent to 0.4 per cent by the year 2000&mdash;once again, the same target of 0.4 per cent&mdash;and in doing so he drew a distinction between a commitment and a mere aspiration. I quote from his speech at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We retain the aspiration to continue real increases in aid to reach the UN target for official development assistance of 0.7 per cent of GNP, and the commitment to at least get to 0.40 per cent by the year 2000 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty clear commitment. But the problem that this poses is that, to fulfil such a commitment, the Labor Party in government would have had to find an extra $1.2 billion. It would have needed $1.2 billion extra money, unfunded, to meet that commitment of 0.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the man who made that promise doing now? He is my friend the member for Werriwa's immediate boss; he is the shadow Treasurer&mdash;the person who would bandy around that sort of a commitment in an election campaign without the slightest hope of ever finding the money. Three days later, once he realised the scale of this folly&mdash;folie de grand&mdash;in a speech before the National Press Club he had to retract the promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There you see a clear difference between what the opposition will do in an election campaign&mdash;make commitments it cannot meet and then quickly fudge them a few days later in a speech&mdash;and what the coalition on this side of the House does. The coalition is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2079"> always quite plain about the commitments it makes. You will see demonstrated on 20 August, when the budget is brought down, that it will fulfil those commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We make no bones about the abolition of DIFF. But it is worth drawing the House's attention to something that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) alluded to during question time today in his answer to a question posed by the shadow minister. He asked the House to ask itself how important this issue is to the opposition and why it was that the first question in this House about this scheme was made 98 days after this government was sworn in, despite the terrible consequences that the shadow minister alludes to&mdash;all this wailing and gnashing of teeth across the Asian region. This must have been plain from the moment we made the announcement during the campaign that we would abolish it. But no, it took 98 days and it was the 140th question.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, let me talk a little more about why we settled on DIFF as what we were going to abolish. Quite plainly, you can sum it up in two words: fiscal discipline. Budgetary health is quite plainly the prerequisite for economic health and competitiveness in this region and the reduction of real interest rates. Having been in private enterprise for a while, I know that what a business has to pay for money is a serious cost to any business. The consequence of a country borrowing too much or a government being too profligate is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> always that the companies, the enterprises and the individuals within that economy must pay more for money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is plain to us and to the opposition, though they are loath to admit it, that we face very serious problems with the current account deficit and with our savings ratio. In order to arrest the trend of national dis&hyphen;saving, we have to take some hard decisions in making reductions to all portfolio areas of the federal government, bar the defence budget. In saying so, we are quite clear that the aid budget cannot be quarantined from this sort of austerity. There is no reason why, in trying to reclaim some of the next generation's assets that have already been spent by the previous government, we should spare the aid budget when we are making the same difficult and hard decisions in other areas, especially where it delivers political pain to Australia in domestic terms. So fiscal discipline is quite plainly necessary if Australia is going to engage effectively in this region and if it is going to be a strong and growing trading nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable gentleman alluded in his speech to the notion that, in abolishing the DIFF, we are somehow doing away with an extraordinary fivefold increase in the trade benefits that accrue to the companies whom we subsidise under this program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I am asking whether there was one. I will go back to the idea that there is a fivefold benefit ahead for any company that is subsidised under this program. We were suspicious of that. We thought it was a rather shallow notion, so we showed the AusAID in-house review of the effectiveness of the DIFF program to Treasury and asked them to scrutinise it and find some flaws in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> And what did Treasury find? Sure enough, the adjectives they used to describe the review were `superficial', `shallow' and `somewhat flawed'. Among other things, they found that the review did not distinguish between gross expenditures made under DIFF programs and net benefits&mdash;that is, the review did not take into account the opportunity cost. No effort seems to have been made to estab lish the veracity of the survey data collected for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More particularly, the review did not ask whether or not DIFF supported activity was actually better or worse than other activity. For example, most of the projects in the DIFF pipeline&mdash;even in the latter days of DIFF&mdash;were infrastructure projects that took place in spoiled markets. Those spoiled markets are where companies, especially French, German and Japanese companies, competed for these projects with subsidies&mdash;subsidies which, in some cases, were not just from their federal governments but from their state governments. So it is fair for Australian parliamentarians to ask ourselves whether we should always be there with our cheque book in these spoiled markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, why should we not spend this aid money on other types of developmental cooperation, or&mdash;and this is a terrible notion that the opposition has had to swallow&mdash;why should we not return it to the taxpayers by making an absolute reduction in the expenditure? When you look at other activities that take place as part of the aid program where we have to make a choice of what to cut, what should we cut? Should we cut the HIV&hyphen;AIDS programs for people in Thailand, Papua New Guinea or the Pacific? These, in my opinion, are of far more immediate consequence to Australians and deserve a higher priority than any form of mixed credit scheme. Or should we make budget cuts to programs which support the education of women and girls? Should we do that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to set a list of priorities in this, and it is the problems of health, immediate poverty and sickness that strike us as deserving a higher priority than mixed credit schemes. That is why the minister said that, if there is room and if budgetary circumstances permit&mdash;that is, if we do our job in this year's budget and restore some rectitude to the federal budget&mdash;down the track, in the financial year after next, we may be able to reintroduce a form of mixed credit scheme and resume some of the projects that were in the pipeline. If it was the case that after the election we had been left with a budget that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2081"> was in a reasonable shape, I have no doubt that there would be no abolition of a scheme like DIFF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, let me also point out one other thing the shadow minister said that is quite wrong. He said that, as a consequence of our reduction of the DIFF scheme, Australia's ODA to GNP ratio would fall from 0.3 per cent to about 0.29 per cent. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's decision to slash Australia's overseas aid commitments to the detriment of our regional engagement and international humanitarian objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), shadow minister for foreign affairs, spoke in detailed terms on Australia's overseas aid commitments and our international humanitarian obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to focus on that part of the MPI which refers to the detriment of our regional engagement. It is clear that, so far as our aid program is concerned, not only are we looking at the notion of seeking to assist developing countries; we are also conscious of our place in the international arena and in the region and the sorts of benefits which come to a nation through having a sustained and sensible aid program. So far as Australia is concerned, that gets down to notions of trade and notions of export&mdash;not just export of goods but export of our expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The development import finance facility, the DIFF scheme, has, in a sense, two bangs for the taxpayer's buck. The government has abolished the scheme. The two bangs for the buck are that the scheme is an effective aid program and it also brings very many benefits to Australia so far as trade and exports are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As part of the government's response to its abolition of the DIFF scheme, so far as trade related matters are concerned, the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) has had the opportunity to explain to the House how this could somehow enhance Australia's trade and export performances. But he has ducked the ques tions, and we know why he has been ducking&mdash;because he has other things on his mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his absence, his colleagues have been talking amongst themselves.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am directing my remarks directly to those aspects of the matter which go to our regional engagement, and I have always regarded trade as an aspect of that. The response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has been to do two things. Firstly, as he did in question time today, to say that the abolition of DIFF is a monumental beat&hyphen;up, that it is not a serious issue and, to quote his words back to him, it is specious to suggest otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, anyone who suggests that the abolition of DIFF is other than a monumental beat&hyphen;up, that it is a serious and not a specious issue, is blackguarded. We saw yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs blackguard the former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Woolcott, and we saw the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Andrew Thomson) today continuing that blackguarding, raising serious questions about Mr Woolcott's integrity and credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at when Mr Woolcott first raised the issue of the abolition of DIFF. He first did it to my knowledge a month ago, Wednesday, 15 May, reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as `Loss of DIFF draws attack from Woolcott'. Mr Woolcott is recorded in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are some very good projects in the pipeline which ministers in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and China were expecting to go ahead . . . <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Scrapping them retrospectively could undermine <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2082"> Australia's credibility as a reliable supplier, and advantage our commercial competitors in the region, who may pick up those projects which Australian companies will not be able to proceed with . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also means considerable wasted time and investment on the part of a number of Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA>Those comments by Mr Woolcott were picked up in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 18 and 19 May. There is also analysis by Geoff Hiscock in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> : `Demise of DIFF a loss of face'. I quote from his analysis:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia's competitors for Asian infrastructure projects will be shaking their heads in wonderment at our short-sightedness . . . What it will not save is Australian face among Asian friends . . . Japanese, German, French, Italian and Spanish companies all benefit . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to refer to an Australian Council for Overseas Aid statement which refers to the abolition of DIFF as sending `all the wrong signals'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Woolcott made the mistake of repeating these analyses of policy and criticisms of the abolition of DIFF in a letter to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs which was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of this week. In his letter, Mr Woolcott is reported as repeating his view that the abolition of DIFF will damage the credibility of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and of the government in Asia, that it will offend neighbouring governments, that it will undermine our national credibility, and harm Australia's competitiveness. The price which Mr Woolcott pays for that is to be blackguarded in this House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;best seen in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> report today headed `Howard's envoy decked by Downer', a report by Ian McPhedran which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, launched yesterday an extraordinary attack on former senior diplomat and Howard Government envoy Richard Woolcott.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the Prime Minister's personal envoy to Malaysia. This is the man who organised the transit lounge meetings between the Prime Minister of Malaysia and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. This is the person who is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> well regarded as President of the Australia-Indonesia Institute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Foreign Affairs comes into this place and says that discussion on the abolition of DIFF is a huge beat&hyphen;up. Let me just very quickly go through some of the people who do not regard this as a beat&hyphen;up&mdash;people who now run the risk of being blackguarded by the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the parliamentary secretary in this place and having their reputations, credibility and integrity attacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the comments of Mr Ian Berckelman, who is the Managing Director of Labax International. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> in May this year, in an interview with Kerry O'Brien and Barrie Cassidy, Mr Berckelman is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DIFF scheme is the only tool that Australian business has to enable it to secure infrastructure projects in the developing countries in South-East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the DIFF scheme is cancelled and we don't get the funds for our project, I think we'll probably call it a day in Indonesia, because we're specialists in this sort of work and it requires a specialist. So, I think we'll probably pack up.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a company that has been active in Indonesia for 20 or 30 years. Mr Berckelman goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, we spend $1.3 million; the Indonesians have spent about . . . it must be close to half a million Australian dollars. And nobody gets the benefit. The project doesn't go ahead. You know, this is nuts. Really silly stuff.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I don't believe the Government actually understands what it's doing.</PARA>
<PARA>And in reference to our neighbours in Asia, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These people are ropeable. They're not happy. They don't like written agreements being broken, particularly memorandums of understanding at a government protocol level.</PARA>
<PARA>He concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If these projects don't go ahead, our reputation and the rest of the guys doing the DIFF scheme projects, it won't be worthwhile going back to Indonesia again. They will not do business because they'll never trust the Government or the supplier again.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2083"> </PARA>
<PARA>These comments have been echoed by people whom you would not necessarily expect to be blackguarded by the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the parliamentary secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the Premier of Victoria calling on the government to reverse its decision: `Kennett opposes Howard over DIFF'. We could understand if the Treasurer (Mr Costello) were blackguarding the Premier of Victoria, but we do not expect the Minister for Foreign Affairs to do so. The Premier of Victoria has come out seeking that the government reverse its decision on the same grounds that were drawn to attention by Mr Woolcott&mdash;this is, this is not a sensible thing to do so far as Australia's reliability and reputation in the region are concerned and it is not a sensible thing to do so far as trade, export and Australian jobs are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The MTIA, Australia's manufacturing engineering and construction industry association, in response to Mr Kennett's call, released a statement saying, `Kennett Right&mdash;DIFF Must Stay':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MTIA Chief Executive Bert Evans said that Mr Kennett had correctly identified the major dangers of abolishing the DIFF scheme to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Do we now wait patiently for Mr Evans to be blackguarded by the Minister for Foreign Affairs? Can we expect to see a government representative at the MTIA dinner later this year, Mr Evans's retirement function, blackguarding Mr Evans because he has had the audacity to point out what is actually commonsense, namely, the short-sightedness of the government abolishing this scheme? We have seen Mr Evans describe the abolition of the scheme as `the most foolish and short-sighted thing' he has seen in his career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These comments have been echoed by the Western Australian State Minister for Commerce and Trade, Hendy Cowan, one of Mr Fischer's National Party colleagues. He criticised the abolition a couple of weeks ago and said that Australia is going to be the only developed country which will not have an equivalent of the DIFF program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A comprehensive analysis of the abolition of DIFF was conducted by the foreign editor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Australian, Mr Sheridan. By way of conclusion, I will quote from his recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The one decision that has been seriously stupid is the abolition of the Development Import Finance Facility. Its abolition is a spectacularly stupid and short-sighted decision. The new Government took the view that aid should not be mixed up with trade and should not be a disguised subsidy for business. As well as slashing the aid budget generally, they promised to abolish DIFF . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance, in a way, is a sad indictment of the opposition. I would have thought the opposition would have been very embarrassed to have its poor performance revealed in relation to its responsibility to the humanitarian programs which we all so much want to see effectively funded for the benefit of people, such as those in Thailand, Zambia and Zimbabwe, because of the huge problem with the HIV virus, and because of child deaths and maternal mortality problems in other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the former government has done is to say to the Australian people and to the aid organisations, `We will fully fund these programs and the DIFF program.' We know that former Senator Gareth Evans, now the member for Holt, made some very firm commitments on behalf of the then government before the election about the future funding of all these programs. I would like to point out that those promises could not have been funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition has done today, with its new shadow minister for foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton)&mdash;and I wish him every success in his endeavours in a very exciting and interesting portfolio&mdash;is to put the new shadow minister in the spotlight to account for the fact that his predecessor, the former minister, now the member for Holt, did not have a hope in Hades of funding the aid promises and the DIFF program that we are now being criticised about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2084"> I think it is a matter of humbug for the opposition to come into the House today and piously present itself as being concerned for these people. The opposition talks about the concern on the part of our regional neigh bours about our policies. The fact is that our regional neighbours have no respect at all for a country which runs itself into debt, which says to children in the next generation, `You can pay for our recurrent expenditure.' That is really what the previous government has been saying and doing over 13&half; years. In fact, it is their fault that the programs that we are now talking about have had to be cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Andrew Thomson) has said that the government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) hope that when we restore financial strength to this nation&mdash;as we will, by working together&mdash;we can restore some benefits to business activity in some of these countries. But for the time being, let it be made clear to the opposition that our position is that we put more faith in having to maintain, as far as we can, the humanitarian programs than in paying a great company like Transfield a subsidy of $150 million under the DIFF program since 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make no criticism at all of Transfield. It has my great respect. All of us know it is a great Australian company. But we are talking about people in countries such as Zimbabwe, the high mortality rate of children in these countries and Australia's ability to fund humanitarian programs compared with our ability to fund support and subsidies for Australian business in these countries. I do not believe we would be responsible if we were to say, `We're going to cut the aid programs to these poor children and their families; we're going to take away the support for these people who are suffering from HIV, but we're going to continue to provide subsidies to Transfield, while we're battling in the domestic economy to bring this country back to proper management again.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what it is all about. You have to prioritise your position and say to yourself, `No, we can't continue to fund those programs to businesses overseas in these circumstances. But we will revisit those programs and introduce appropriate credit programs when we can. In the meantime, we will do  our best to ensure we can maintain the humanitarian programs, despite the great difficulty in what we will be able to do, because of the way in which the previous government ran the economy into the ground, overspent and left us with an $8 billion black hole.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pay tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) for their outstanding achievements in the first 100 or so days of the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government. Already, we are seeing the benefits of that. I particularly welcome the initiative of the minister in the inquiry that has been established&mdash;the Simons review, as it will now be known, into aid programs. It is a long overdue inquiry. The shadow minister was wise enough to give his endorsement to that review, as he should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have let the former government off the hook, because one could ask why a review was not carried out earlier. Maybe when the review is completed some of the reasons why it was not carried out will be revealed, because there may well be some findings that some of the spending of the Australian government in the past 13&half; years has not reached the target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review is the first one since the Jackson report in 1984. The world is a very different place now from what it was then. I encourage the minister, the parliamentary secretary and the Minister for Trade to challenge the practices of the past, to ensure that the aid programs, on behalf of Australian taxpayers, are reaching the target and are effective, because it is our responsibility to make sure that they do reach the people who need them in a very effective way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question that many of the aid programs have lost their way. I think that is acknowledged on both sides. It is time for a comprehensive review. I congratulate the government for opening the book in the way that it has and for appointing such eminent people to head the review. I look forward to the results of that review and wish Paul Simons, the former executive chairman of Woolworths&mdash;an outstandingly successful retail organisation in Australia&mdash;every success in his endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to my opening remarks about accountability. When the opposition brings in an MPI, as it is its right to do, and opens up a Pandora's box, as it has, I think it is only fair and proper that the opposition be brought to account for deceiving the aid organisations in the community and also for misrepresenting the position of our regional neighbours about the AIDS program. That is why I hope that when they read the contents of this debate and discuss it at ambassadorial and other <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2085"> levels they will be aware that the present opposition is parading around trying to foment problems and trying to undermine the efforts of this government to get financial management back in place in Australia but was prepared to put this nation into further debt by making promises to increase the aid programs if it had been re&hyphen;elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To our regional neighbours, who are very astute people, that will be something that the Labor opposition will have to live with for a long time. Our neighbours will make a very critical judgment of the former government's performance in driving its own country into debt, spending more than it earned, expecting our kids to pay for recurrent expenditure debts and conning the aid organisations prior to the election in order to buy votes. The former government said it would do better in maintaining all these programs when, in fact, it was not able to fund them without massive further borrowings and increases in taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the opposition wants the government to be judged, the judgment will be that we will be encouraged by our regional neighbours for our forthrightness in saying before the election what our policies would be, for our initiative in having the review that should lead to very effective aid programs of the future and for being absolutely honest and pragmatic in saying that, in the case of humanitarian programs, when money is short, the Australian taxpayer wants the AIDS victims to be assisted first, before business. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(4.15 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with the Customs Amendment Bill 1966 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1966. We support the Customs Amendment Bill 1966. In essence, it gives effect to what the Labor government proposed to do in the innovation statement toward the end of last year. We will be opposing the second bill, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1966. The reason we are opposing it is that it introduces a consumer tax&mdash;a GST on imports&mdash;and represents a massive breach of promise on the part of the government that is now bringing it forward. Just to remind people of what that promise was, I refer them to what the now Treasurer (Mr Costello) had to say at the Press Club last year:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But what I am saying here is, we'll not be hiking the income tax rates or company tax rates or sales tax rates or extending the sales tax in any way that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2087"> the government is proposing. That is not our agenda. It is not our agenda to introduce new taxes. It is not our agenda to bulk up the currently existing taxes. That's not our agenda.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how much more categoric one can be about what they intend not to do in the course of a parliament, but this is absolutely categoric.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I might also say that in the course of the election campaign that oft&hyphen;repeated statement was made again by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer, `There will be no new taxes and no increases in taxes under a coalition government.' Yet today in question time we saw many examples of how those taxes are going to be increased under a coalition government. I will refer to those in a minute. I simply make the point that the reason we are opposing the element of this bill is that it extends the tariff concession order effectively to consumers which means an increased tax to consumers and, therefore, is a breach of election commitment to those consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the first time that the government has breached this commitment. There are least two other occasions on which the commitment of `no new taxes' has been breached so far, and we have not even got a budget. Those opposite went to the last election saying that there would be no new taxes, yet there have been breaches now on at least three occasions. What are those three occasions? The one we are dealing with today, which I will come to in more detail in a minute, introduces by the back door a GST of three per cent on all imports&mdash;a complete breach of the government's election commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The other breach occurred when they introduced a tax on building workers' travelling allowances. We know this government does not like trade unionists and that during the last election they promised that no&hyphen;one would be worse off, but by eliminating that exemption they effectively raised the tax of building workers. Members would be aware of significant demonstrations by building workers around this country because of that decision. But it is not just the building workers who are reacting to this. I understand from a newspaper report late last week that the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, Mr Collins, has written to the govern ment expressing concern about this decision and the impact that it will have in New South Wales. The simple fact needs to be underlined that these allowances were not taxed before this government came to power. They now are taxed and, apart from the fact that this breaches the government's promise of no new taxes, it also breaches the commitment that no worker will be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other place where we have seen a massive backdown by the coalition on their election promises was in the farcical Premiers Conference last week. It was referred to by the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, as the greatest shambles of a conference that he had ever participated in. It was referred to by the Premier of Queensland, Mr Borbidge, as representing the duplicity and the deceit of the Treasurer in trying to put something over them that he had not had the decency to come to talk to them about before. All these people are members of coalition governments in other states, I might add. The Treasurer of Victoria said that the decision on wholesale sales tax on cars was a breach of an election promise. It was a breach on at least three fronts according to the Premier of South Australia, and on five fronts according to the Victorian Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people are not friends of Labor. You would have thought that they would have been allies of the current coalition government. Even they could not accept the fact that the government was seeking to introduce new taxes despite their election pledge that there would be no new taxes. I will repeat what they said during the election campaign and obviously well before it, `There will be no new taxes and new increases in taxes under a coalition government.' If one reads the reports in today's newspaper, what are the implications for the states after the fiasco that was the Premiers Conference last week? The coalition government failed to get its proposed tax increase through on motor vehicles because of the disastrous consequence it was going to have on the motor industry, quite apart from what it was going to cost the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A compromise was hammered out. Who is going to pay for that compromise? The people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2088"> who are going to pay for that compromise are the residents in each of the states. In the case of New South Wales, we are looking at $100 per household per year being levied on council rates. Over three years&mdash;that is how long they are going to be collecting it&mdash;that amounts to $300 per household. This is Pete's poll tax. This is the Treasurer's poll tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has said in this House on numerous occasions that there will be no new taxes. Because of the stupidity with which he approached last week's Premiers Conference and because he was sidelined from the final deliberations that resulted in the conclusion to the Premiers Conference&mdash;they had to patch up a solution&mdash;the consequence is increased taxes not just in New South Wales but also in Queensland and the other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premier of Queensland has to find $190 million, which essentially will come from a household poll tax. Queensland will also be levying Pete's poll tax to the tune of $190 million next year. In New South Wales it is $900 million over three years and in Queensland it is $190 million in one year. The government still tries to say that it has not breached any promises. You should go and ask the residents in those states, the people who will have to pay these taxes, who is to blame. The Premiers will have no difficulty telling them who is to blame. They will say that they had to do this because of the mismanagement of the coalition government at the Premiers Conference last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Victoria is looking at a $600 million shortfall over three years. We know that Jeff Kennett was the proponent of the household tax. He is going to use the shambles of last week's conference as the justification to keep it going in Victoria. They will keep the levy of $100 per household per year in place. It is a tax on every household. It will be the same in Tasmania. There is the possibility of another tax impacting directly on households.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had two examples, prior to this bill coming before the House, where the coalition has breached its election promise relating to no new taxes. We are debating in the House today a bill which will in essence see a new tax imposed on consumers&mdash;a GST on imports; a three per cent tax on a range of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consumer items that previously did not exist. This is a deliberate policy by the federal government. They cannot claim that this is being foisted on people by the state governments. This is a deliberate policy decision and is in breach of everything they said and hoped people would believe before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, the first bill essentially implements the innovation statement that Labor introduced at the end of last year. If you like, it is the innovation statement bill. It involves the removal of the market test as a qualification for receiving a tariff concession order. It involves the tightening of the project status arrangements for policy by-laws where only projects worth over $120 million can qualify for project status. To the extent to which the bill implements that which Labor proposed, of course we support it. I am happy to indicate to the House today that at the appropriate time we will be lending our support to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is a completely different proposition. This bill proposes to increase the tariff concession and some policy by-law rates from zero to three per cent. Unscramble the jargon and essentially what this means is that where people or businesses previously paid nothing in terms of tax they now must pay a minimum of three per cent. It is a direct three per cent lift&mdash;three per cent on businesses and three per cent on consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the discussions we have been having with customs officers it is interesting to note that they refer to this as the tax bill. There is no doubt in their minds that it is about taxing things. The bureaucrats who will have to implement this legislation know it is a tax. It is only the government that comes into this place and tries to pretend it is something other than a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just customs officers who describe it as such, many authorities have been quoted as saying that this in fact is a tax. We have had many representations from industry concerning this being a tax. The National Farmers Federation says that it is a tax. In fact, the High Court of Australia has said that if anything is being done to tariffs it is a tax. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2089"> Who is the only person who does not say it is a tax? Peter Costello.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer will not concede that it is a tax because he knows that to concede that demonstrates absolutely that the promise he made during the election campaign about no new taxes is fractured. We heard him in the House a few weeks ago refuse to concede that it was a tax. He simply said it was a tariff. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) introduced this legislation&mdash;he is a minister in the same coalition government as the Treasurer&mdash;and he concedes that it is a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 12 April this year, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism said it was `totally correct' to say that the removal of tariff concession orders was an extra tax on business. No greater authority than the minister himself said that this was a tax. It is only the Treasurer that will not concede this point, but of course we know he is shameless. Because of the shamelessness adding to the shambles of last week, we are dealing with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not content, though, with imposing this tax on business inputs, the coalition has extended the measure to consumers. The bill will impose a three per cent tariff concession rate on a whole range of consumer items and have the effect of yielding $100 million a year from people's pockets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember what they said in the election? `No new taxes.' If they think that $100 million to Australian families is nothing, then they should be prepared to get up and say that. One hundred million dollars is a hell of a lot of money&mdash;and that is what this bill will raise from Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of the difficulty that the minister was going through when introducing this legislation, he had to deal with many disaffected businesses which realised that this measure would increase their costs. He actually went so far as describing the decision to eliminate the tariff concession order on business as `dreadful policy'. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> on 9 May, the scrapping of the tariff concession scheme was `dreadful policy'. But the point is, what he thought was dreadful policy when it came to businesses <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> became good policy when extended to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of view is it when you have the government in here prepared to try to do something for businesses, recognising the dreadful nature of the policy and conceding that openly but, as part of the solution, shifting the burden to consumers, to families, to the battlers, to the people who cannot pass it on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that businesses, one way or the other, will find ways of accommodating this. I see the minister coming into the House now, so I will be interested to hear, when he eventually sums up, how something that he described as `dreadful policy' for businesses now becomes good policy for consumers. Apart from the broken promises of the Treasurer and the whole of the government on `No new taxes', go and tell them why this is good policy for them. You will have to do a lot of explaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have had the opportunity in this House, minister, to do some of that explaining but you have baulked at it every time. You have walked away from the dispatch box every time we have had you up there asking questions about this. You have walked away without giving any answer at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not just a consumer tax of three per cent. The most shameless act being perpetrated today in this legislation is the government's refusal to produce any list of consumer items which will be hit by the import tax. One figure puts it as high as 17,000 different items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this House we have asked the minister to produce a list. He has not. While waiting for the legislation, we have said that there could have been something in the explanatory memorandum indicating which items or lists would appear. That has not materialised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put a question on notice in both houses. They have had plenty of time&mdash;almost a month&mdash;to come back with this answer. They pride themselves on lifting the standards in this parliament by saying that they will ensure that answers to questions on notice will come back much more expeditiously. Not only can we not get an answer in the House; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2090"> we cannot get it outside the House&mdash;and all the minister does is laugh. It is not just a broken promise, it is a mystery tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A mystery tax?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People do not know what it will apply to because you will not produce the list, despite the fact that we have given you the opportunity at every stage to outline it. It is not just a GST on imports. By being a mystery tax it becomes, in essence, a lucky dip&mdash;or, rather, an unlucky dip. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> They are asking the parliament to now pass this legislation and find out what it applies to later. What sort of policy is that by a coalition government that holds itself out as raising the standards, as being more open with the people of Australia and having the parliament much more accountable? The executive of the government will not give the details.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see government members in the House that will speak in this debate. Do they know what this list includes? I would be interested to know whether they had any greater satisfaction than us when it came to asking the minister. Of course, he comes in here and laughs at the suggestion that it is clever not to produce the list.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what will government members be like when they are confronted in their constituencies by people asking, `To what does this tax apply?' Three per cent on 17,000 different items, but at this stage people will not be told what it applies to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the sorts of things that will be picked up are: aerobic exercise equipment, baby walkers, basketballs, battery operated dolls, children's playground equipment, food processors, scooters, spotlights, squeaky toys, vacuum cleaners and, that last one, Christmas stockings unfilled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you this: with this new tax on consumers, with this GST by the back door, there will be a lot of unfilled Christmas stockings at the end of this year, because this is a shameless slug on the battlers, on the families, on the households of this country which you did not have the honesty before the last election to tell them about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this is in essence the reason we are opposing this part of the cognate bills&mdash;in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so far as it imposes this secret tax, this hidden tax, this mystery tax on consumers. But the bill also sets some policy by-law rates at three per cent and others at zero. I do not know whether members of the House are aware of the policy by-law system, but essentially it was a fall&hyphen;back position for those who had failed to get the tariff concession order; they could effectively get an exemption under a policy by-law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, people were able to have that policy by-law set at zero. The government's approach is to raise that as well to three per cent in a number of cases. Let me give an example of this. Goods designed for the mining sector can be imported without a duty payment, provided they are part of a project worth more than $10 million. They can come in free. But machine tools for working advanced metals can get only the three per cent concessional rate. In other words, they have to pay something; they have to pay the three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So businesses that have $10 million&hyphen;plus can still get the zero rate. But with small businesses&mdash;the other clarion call of the coalition government during the election; how they are going to support small business&mdash;the impact of the policy by-law is to slug them. It is to put them at a disadvantage to the larger companies. This results in some very strange anomalies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this does is demonstrate the haste with which the bill was subsequently put together, given the huge difficulty that the minister got into not only with businesses but also with the private little clash he was having with the Treasurer. That was the clash in which he rolled the Treasurer; the one in which he has been given a tick in terms of performance along with some other ministers. I notice that the minister sitting at the table, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), did not get a tick, but neither did he get into the cabinet. I think we all understand why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But at least the minister for industry got a tick. Why? Because he was seen to have rolled Peter Costello. He rolled him because he was able to take the pressure off business and shift it to consumers. Great achievement! <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2091"> That was a fantastic achievement! That was a circumstance in which you rolled the Treasurer but you made the consumers pay, you made families pay and you are making small businesses pay what they could have otherwise had an exemption from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also very interesting, when we look at this issue of the small business sector, to see whether the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) explained the impact of this legislation when he called that small business summit together. I am sure there are a lot of questions raised about it. But, again, given that the small business minister will not come in here and answer questions either, it seems to me that small business would not have had much satisfaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By a very strange quirk, this bill seems to put a premium on failure. Firms that want duty-free entry under a policy by-law first have to fail in their application for the three per cent concession. So the silly position is that those who cannot make the case for the three per cent&mdash;in other words, the thing that they have to pay on&mdash;can then be capable of being rewarded with a free rate. You are rewarding failure. We hear all the government's arguments about efficiency, rewarding efficiency and rewarding success. This is a piece of legislation that rewards failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our approach is to remove that red tape and to make the position much clearer and much more open in terms of what businesses can get. We propose that the tariff concession no longer apply to the business inputs, that importers of business inputs could seek a zero per cent tariff through the policy by-law system, provided that it involved those projects of $10 million or more. That is what the coalition supported. So what we are really doing with the amendment we are foreshadowing is to restore that component.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of our amendment is to do two things. It is to say that this new tax should not apply to consumers. It is contrary to what the coalition opposition said they would do in government. They therefore have no mandate to do it in government. The other thing we want to do through the amendment is to ensure that businesses, having failed through <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the tariff concession, still get the opportunity for support through the by-law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the proposal that we talked about during the election campaign, which was to eliminate the tariff concession order on business inputs, we said that we would consult with industry on the implementation of the measure and that we would effectively consider any hardship that came about. We would allow for additional revenue raised through our approach to feed back into help for industry through the policy by-law system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should seriously reflect on the amendments that we will put. We are not saying that we want to hold up the revenue raising capacity of the government through measures associated with addressing the tariff concession orders. But we are implacably opposed to shifting the burden to consumers and making it harder for businesses that can present a real case to get a concession through the alternative route of the policy by-law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister is prepared to redraft the bill to take into account those two aspects, then we can still see this legislation passed in the course of this sitting fortnight. We are not here to obstruct the government's ability to raise revenue which they said they had a mandate to raise. They did go to the last election and seek a mandate to do what we were proposing to do&mdash;that is, to abolish the tariff concession order and to essentially raise some revenue from the business community. In essence that seemed fair because, with the massive loss of revenue to government through the reduction in tariffs over the years, this was a means by which some of that revenue could at least be restored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We strongly oppose the move in the bill to impose the three per cent import tax on a wider range of consumer items&mdash;the government have no mandate to do that&mdash;but we will give them the chance to pass the bill in this session if they agree to certain conditions. They are set out in our second reading amendment, which proposes that the bill be withdrawn and revised so that consumer goods receiving tariff concessions continue to enter Australia free of duty and that no change be made to the duty rate which currently applies to policy by&hyphen;laws.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2092">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government does not take up that option and if they continue to proceed with this bad bill as it stands, then we as an opposition will continue to oppose it. This bill involves a fundamental breach of the government's core election commitment. We said when we became an opposition that we were going to hold them accountable to the promises they made, and this is one example where we are doing just that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 states an evaluation was conducted in 1995 into changes to the tariff concession system. The evaluation found that, while the system made concessions available for importers, Australian manufacturers were being adversely affected by its operation. The evaluation concluded that tariff concessions should be made only where there is no Australian manufacturer of goods substitutable for those imported. The aim of this bill is to align the operation of the system and make concessional entry readily available without adversely affecting the tariff assistance given to Australian manufacturers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy by&hyphen;law system will be revamped to contain costs. The decision overcomes the unfair and unworkable proposal&mdash;put forward by the former government&mdash;to totally abolish tariff concessions on business inputs. Labor's proposal would have created an administrative nightmare. It would also have unfairly penalised Australian manufacturers by imposing higher costs on business inputs while at the same time competing inputs were to benefit from a reduction in the general tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition solution is a pragmatic response to the concerns of industry. It spreads the cost more widely and provides relief to key industries that would have suffered under Labor's proposal. For example, under Labor's proposal the car industry and the textile, clothing and footwear industry would have had to contend with an increase in tariff paid on imported components and materials from zero up to 15 per cent, even 25 per cent and in some cases 37 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition solution ensures that these producers will pay no more than three per cent duty. In making our decision, we have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> carefully weighed the employment, investment and revenue implications of the change. While we have limited the impact of any additional cost to industry, we have been firm. Industry will still shoulder its share of the burden needed to meet our commitments and improve the budget situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed revocation of the five policy by&hyphen;law items and the introduction of the revised criteria against which requests for concessions under these items will be considered will result in considerable revenue savings. It is expected that, in the 1996-97 budget year, these will be $29 million; in 1997-98, $32 million; in 1998-99, $34 million; and in 1999&hyphen;2000, $37 million. As from 1 July 1996 the trade concession system will operate at a concessional rate of duty of three per cent. The trade concessional system will still apply to both consumer goods and business inputs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes in the tariff concession system arise from the government's election commitments and acceptance of tariff concession system reforms recommended in 1995 by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. The most important change is the removal of the so&hyphen;called market test clause from the core criteria. The existence of the market test has meant that tariff concession orders have been granted to the detriment of Australian manufacturers, because it is very difficult for an Australian manufacturer to prove prospectively that the market for its goods will be adversely affected by the duty&hyphen;free importation of substitutable goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the market test has been removed, the substitutability test will be the remaining core criterion. Therefore, the Australian Customs Service will not grant a tariff concession order where it is satisfied that substitutable goods are produced in Australia. Concessions will be made only where there is no Australian manufacturer of goods substitutable for those which are subject to the tariff concession application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In future the onus for demonstrating that there are no substitutable goods produced in Australia will rest with the applicant for tariff concession orders. Tariff concession order applicants will be responsible for researching <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2093"> the existence of Australian manufacturers of substitutable goods prior to their lodgment for application with Customs. Furthermore, the application will have to provide the name of the importer seeking the concession. These details will be gazetted to notify applicants of Australian manufacturers claiming they produce substitutable goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present legislation allows the commencement date of a tariff concession to be backdated to 28 days before the lodgment of application. There is now no rationale for backdating tariff concession orders. Making orders operative from the date of lodgment of application should encourage importers to lodge their applications earlier. The bill will also enable Customs to commence revocation action for tariff concession orders where there are Australian manufacturers of substitutable goods and where the orders have not been used for two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition of `made to order capital equipment' will be amended to allow concessions for equipment made on only a one-off basis to meet a specific order, rather than being the subject of regular or intermittent production, and to exclude goods made as a result of production runs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments proposed in this bill, such as the removal of the market test from the core criteria and the new revocation facility for existing tariff concession orders and commercial tariff concession orders, will result in huge savings over the next five years. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment to be moved by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1). The amendment asks the government effectively to take the bill away and redraft it in such a way that it honestly presents to the House legislation in relation to tariffs rather than an attempt to introduce a consumption tax&mdash;that is to say, a small form of a GST&mdash;into the taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really can be summed up as a rather dishonest attempt to introduce the tip of the iceberg of a GST into our taxation system. We would then end up with a situation where the Australian public would be faced with a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consumption tax. Then, no doubt, given the rate at which promises are being broken by this government, more and more discussion would be initiated on bringing back the idea of a GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not prepared to allow, in any way, this dishonest exercise of trying to misuse this bill by bringing in a certain kind of consumption tax that would cover a significant number of goods which the Australian people certainly made clear in the 1993 election that they rejected. What we have here is a backdoor attempt to introduce it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that a quiet debate is going on within the government on this issue. This government consists&mdash;in philosophical terms&mdash;of people who are pragmatic and relatively moderate and then those who have absorbed the Fightback New Right agenda put down by the former leader and who are really trying to bring that agenda to pass. Even though John Howard, the Prime Minister, when he went to the Australian people, said, `We are not introducing a GST and we have rejected the key elements of Fightback,' what we are increasingly getting is policy after policy with elements of Fightback ideas coming in&mdash;and in this case a GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leader of this dramatic movement is the Treasurer (Mr Costello), who has always had that New Right agenda. What has he tried to do? He has tried to bring it in in a number of ways: by creating this mythology of the $8 billion hole and using this mythology as an excuse to break all the promises which Mr Howard, as Prime Minister, made in relation to services.</PARA>

We suggested the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) as a way of gaining some revenue in a responsible way. Instead of proceeding along the path suggested by the Labor Party, the government accepted part of the Labor Party's approach but then added on this other stuff&mdash;the consumption tax.

Why was he forced to back off on his proposal regarding the imposition of new taxes? Leaving aside the fact that it was clearly a breach of a promise by the government that it would not impose new taxes, he failed in the most fundamental rule of administration. Even a junior minister would know that, if you are going to bring in something like that, there is a such a thing as consultation with people to see what the situation is.

Our five per cent proposal was very clear and would have raised the money in an appropriate way. In an attempt to tell some sections of business that you will not actually impose this taxation burden on them, you have decided to impose it across a large range of consumption goods. Therefore, you are introducing, as I said, a consumption tax. We have clearly said in our second reading amendment that if you take that aspect of it out we will pass the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very serious proposal. It was discussed at length in the shadow ministry. We want your Minister for Industry, Science <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2095"> and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is a pragmatic person and knows about these things, unlike the Treasurer, to take our proposal seriously. When this proposal goes to the other place, we will be moving an amendment to it. We will move it not only here but in the other place. In the Senate, it will be made perfectly clear that we will not pass the legislation unless the consumption tax aspect of the bill is taken out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is no idle threat. We are saying to you that, if you want to gain that amount of money as defined by the original intention of this proposal, you will have to abide by the will of the Senate on this matter. It will depend on the views of the minor parties, but it is most likely that the section on the consumption tax will be excised from the legislation. Unless you are prepared to do that and to support another of our amendments, we will oppose your position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say something about the second part of the amendment, which deals with the policy by&hyphen;law arrangement. When we said that we would legislate, we talked about how certain exemptions would be made through the policy by&hyphen;law process. When you brought in your legislation, you dropped most of that consideration. Companies that had a case to put will not be in a position to do so as a result of you dropping that aspect of our original proposal. We have not been able to determine from all the material you have given us why you have done that. Why have you not kept that aspect of the proposal concerning the policy by&hyphen;law process?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are putting a very reasonable amendment to you. The first part of the amendment relates to a consumption tax and the second relates to the policy by-laws. If you put both of them together, we will support the legislation and you will gain that section of revenue. We are not interested in taking gross revenue away from you. We are not interested in being obstructionist in relation to raising revenue. We are not going to allow a false approach, where you misuse this legislation to bring in, as I said, a backdoor consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both sides of this House are agreed on the general thrust of the legislation, which relates <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to business inputs. We have clearly explained that this sudden, unexplained broadening of the legislation is an attempt to impose a consumption tax. It is the wrong way to do it. If the minister were really interested in bringing in a consumption tax, he would surely put it up&hyphen;front, discuss it and debate it instead of bringing it in by this backdoor fashion, which is what is happening here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said that at some time in the past people from both sides of this House have talked about a consumption tax. However, they have talked about it very generally, in that people would be protected if such a tax were brought in. In this instance, there is no protection for people. It would just be dropped on people. There would be a three per cent increase on all these goods consumed by Australians with no explanation. The government will not say, `Let's look at the whole taxation system,' and own up to the fact that this is a breach of its promise not to introduce a consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Australian Labor Party is in opposition, it will help the government as far as possible in its revenue raising. We are committed to that general proposition. Where the government is clearly breaching its promises or where it is clearly extending beyond its mandate in these areas or where it is attempting to introduce new forms of taxes when it clearly said in the election that it would not, we have an obligation to hold the government to its promises and its commitments. We will do that. Not only will we try to do what we can in the House of Representatives but we will use all of our forces in the Senate to ensure that outcome.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government, in order to raise revenue&mdash;it was not a new tax in the eyes of the previous government&mdash;decided in 1995 to impose a tariff on goods and business charges which would have raised five per cent additional funds. The honourable member says that that is not a tax or a new charge because it was the Labor Party that thought of it but that if the coalition imposes the same sort of tariff that is something new, even though before and during the election campaign we said that we would do the same thing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2097">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just remind the member: you were prepared to put a five per cent impost onto the business community, and a lot of those goods that would carry the five per cent surcharge are business inputs. They are used for making things. It does not appear to come to your mind that, if you increase the cost of making things, the ultimate selling price is going to increase proportionately. Therefore, if the opposition are going to argue an increased tax, their proposal was also an increased tax. But they are not prepared to see it in that light.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay, I will come to the consumption side. What you were prepared to do was increase the cost by five per cent for all inputs imported into Australia for Australian businesses. That measure would disadvantage Australian manufacturers as compared with imported goods. You were not going to put anything on an equivalent good made outside the country and directly imported to the consumer. Therefore, you were prepared to tolerate a price differential of at least five per cent to the disadvantage of Australian manufacturers, Australian workers and Australian industries. You were prepared to promote that as a good decision and as a responsible decision. You were prepared to accept an additional five per cent input cost for Australian manufacturers and put them at a severe disadvantage against imports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been the life story of 13 years of Australian Labor Party government. Slowly but surely, as they proclaim the increase and betterment of Australian industries and Australian manufacturing industries, they ground them into the dust. For every year that the Labor Party proclaimed themselves to be the supporters of Australian manufacturing industries and Australian workers, more and more went bankrupt. Here was another decision in line with previous decisions of the Australian Labor Party where they were prepared to increase the costs for Australian businesses and disadvantage them as compared with imported goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it shameful of the Australian Labor Party that they would even contemplate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disadvantaging Australian workers as compared with workers in Asia, in Europe or in South America. Their proposal in 1995 regarding tariff concessions was that inputs into the plastics industries, the auto industries, tool making and most Australian manufacturing industries were to be increased by five per cent. A five per cent increase along the line of a charge is then multiplied as that item, that good or that equipment and machinery is added into production costs. So a five per cent downstream input charge can finish up as a substantial increase in the finished price of the goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party were prepared to accept that. They were prepared to say that Australian manufacturing industries and the workers employed in those manufacturing industries were to have more lead put into their saddlebags and be disadvantaged further by this proposal. But they did not contemplate any process to rectify the increased price differentiation between imported and locally manufactured goods. So, on coming to office, we sought to introduce in an equitable way the tariff concession process that we were committed to during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Australian Labor Party had consulted or listened to Australian manufacturers, if they had really represented Australian workers, they would have known that there would be a roar of complaint from them. They saw very clearly what this tariff increase would have done to their industries. They knew that the input costs were going to rise for their industry. They knew that, if the Australian Labor Party's proposal had been successful, there would have been a serious price disadvantage for locally manufactured goods. That is the complaint of the whole of Australia. It is a complaint that people like Harry Wallace of the Australian Owned Companies Association and others from organisation after organisation bring to this place but which falls on deaf ears as far as the Australian Labor Party are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2098"> It has been only the coalition that has been prepared to ask about the core of the problem. The core of the problem has been that time and again the Labor Party has been prepared to load the lead into the saddlebags of Aus tralian manufacturers either by taxes or by additional charges so that they become less and less competitive. They are not prepared to remove the barriers to competitiveness and prepare them for getting out and having a go and providing additional employment. The Labor Party has not been prepared to do that. The coalition has listened and is prepared to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a difference between the way in which the two main parties operate. There was no willingness on the part of the Australian Labor Party to look at the penalties and disadvantages in the industrial relation system. The proposals of the former Minister for Industrial Relations, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), on unfair dismissal wrecked business after business. The complaint right through the community was that business was disadvantaged in comparison with its neighbours. Labor's tariff concession proposals did exactly the same thing. They were prepared to penalise Australian manufacturers with an extra charge but they would not put a compensatory charge on all imports. They disadvantaged the price of goods that were manufactured locally and advantaged the price of goods that were manufactured overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The tack taken by the Australian Labor Party that this is a new tax is very strange. This legislation is not a new tax. In 1978 the Fraser government put a two per cent tariff across everything with a few exceptions. Just about all imports to Australia faced a two per cent tariff increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That process remained in place for nine or 10 years. It was in about 1987 that the Labor government removed the two per cent tariff barrier, only to reimpose one a few years later, but with the sophistry and the manipulative process of mind to say, `This is not revenue raising, this has nothing to do with anything but the management of government, and this does not impose a tax or a charge on Australian businesses. We're quite entitled to put five per cent on Australian manufacturers. We took off the two per cent of the Fraser government.' At that time the Labor government had proclaimed the Fraser government's two per cent as an unnecessary burden on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian manufacturers and Australian industry. It talked at that time about a level playing field. But it was only seven or eight years later that it reimposed a tariff at a higher rate and was unprepared at that point to call it for what it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But those opposite&mdash;having been aware throughout the totality of the election campaign that it was the coalition's commitment, its policy, to introduce the same tax&mdash;walk into the parliament today and say, `Well, we're not going to really block this measure in the Senate, but we're going to amend it in such a way that, unless it is what we agree to, it will be blocked anyway.' They claim that that is not blocking a process. They claim it is assisting the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government denies that it is a matter of assistance. We would say that what the Australian Labor Party proposes is completely unacceptable. The coalition is proposing, firstly, an actual reduction in input costs for Australian manufacturing industries&mdash;Labor's proposal&mdash;and, secondly, a proper levelling of the playing field for locally manufactured goods compared with imports. It is a fair proposal. It is a proper proposal. It is not a tax increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a process that the Labor Party itself was prepared to introduce. However, because those opposite were not prepared to think through the disadvantages they were going to impose on Australian manufacturers, they are now saying to the government, `Unless you agree with this proposal then we are going to change what you are trying to bring in.' In trying to bring this legislation in, we are trying to rectify the stupidity, the short-sightedness and the crazy ideas that brought the previous government down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is pragmatic commonsense. It will work. It will not disadvantage Australian workers or employees. It will not disadvantage Australian businesses. It will not result in additional unfair charges on locally manufactured goods when compared with imported goods. I cannot see how the Australian Labor Party can even contemplate presenting the sophistry of, `This is a new tax, and because it is a new tax we are going to disagree with it.' </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2099">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is foolish to think that this sort of argument will gather any mileage anywhere in Australia. The entire Australian work force in the manufacturing industry knows that it was a stupid, futile and loaded proposition with which you came to the Australian people in 1995. The work force as well as employers know that this proposal from the coalition rectifies the problems created by the Australian Labor Party proposal. They know that it is not a tax. They have seen proposals like this come and go over the last 10 or 15 years. They accept that it is part of the process of government to either put on tariffs or take off tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suddenly, the Australian Labor Party wants to call it a new tax. That will not wash either because tariffs, in the way they have been applied both by your government and the Fraser government and as they are now being applied by this government, are not being used as a taxation process. They are being used to establish a process which you instigated and which we have corrected and turned into a much fairer proposition. That is what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has done, that is what the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has supported and that is what the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) has promoted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot come into the House now with some sort of speaker's list of experts in economic and political theory such as the member for Calwell and think you are going to gain mileage out there in the electorate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very much indebted to the Chief Government Whip, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), for his contribution on the customs bills. In particular, I admired his sophistry in suggesting that to apply a three per cent tariff across the board is not a new tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not really had an opportunity to comment on the last election. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had a very handsome victory. I think it is fair to say that, notwithstanding his many years in politics, the people of Australia felt that over time he had perhaps changed and that this was a different John Howard to the one we had seen previously. Indeed, perhaps the people of Australia felt that this was very much a different coalition to the one which had presented in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is true to say that the people of Australia accepted that they would not introduce a GST, that they would not hack public spending by $10 billion, that they would not introduce a youth wage of $3 per hour. When they said they would not introduce any new taxes and charges, it is fair to say the people of Australia truly believed them. How disappointed they must be for having extended an opportunity to the coalition to form the government of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate on this legislation today, government members are saying that a tax is a tax; it is not a tariff increase. When I go back to my electorate and ask people, `What do you think is a tax increase? For example, if there were a measure to increase the excise on cigarettes or alcohol, would you see that as an increase?' they answer yes. Petrol&mdash;yes. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2100"> Imports of consumer goods&mdash;yes, they do see it as a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pointless for government members to suggest that this proposal, which will rake in $338 million in the first year, $358 million in the second year, $393 million in the third year and $413 million in the fourth year, is not a tax but somehow a painless extraction of money from the people of Australia when they purchase imported goods. I think those comments will be falling on deaf ears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the suggestion we have heard from the Premiers Conference that the proposal to do away with duty-free purchases by state governments and local governments was not the imposition of a tax, again I do not think the people of Australia will have any sympathy for that point of view. With regard to the fact that the states have stared down the barrel of a $1,200 million tax grab by the Commonwealth from them each year every year, that is not consistent with the policies which the people of Australia thought they were voting for when they voted for the Liberal and National parties. I think the government will be very sadly mistaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is entirely consistent for the opposition to acknowledge the mandate that the government has achieved. It is a very handsome and a very generous mandate. I might even say that to those on this side of the House it is very hurtful to see so many of our colleagues lose their seats and so many enthusiastic new government members take over those seats. But Mr Howard and the government went to the people of Australia in March this year promising no new taxes. The honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) referred during the election to the famous American presidential comment `Read my lips'. Indeed, the people of Australia did read the lips. They read the lips of the Prime Minister; they read the lips of the Treasurer (Mr Costello); in fact, they read the lips of all members of the Liberal and National parties who were successful at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think they sincerely believed that this government would be responsible and that having said they would not introduce any new taxes they would not. How can we say that extracting $338 million in one year, $358 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million in the second year, $393 million in the third year and $413 million in the fourth year is not a tax grab? That is what government members would have you believe. But I have absolute confidence in the people of Australia. I think they were right in 1996, but I warn you that you cannot take them for granted. A government will not survive by sleight of hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These tariff concession system changes impose a three per cent tariff on a range of imported goods. I am happy to read out the list of goods if any member is in any difficulty as to exactly what they are. In fact, I have told all the families in my electorate exactly what sorts of goods will be affected. For example, they will pay this three per cent tariff on basketballs, bicycles, bicycle speedometers, dice, cymbals, cots or pram rockers, cot lights, voice operated coin operated pinball machines, electric hair clippers, electric power drills&mdash;the range of goods is endless. It is an extra tax&mdash;in a sense, a GST on imported consumer goods&mdash;which this new government has levied on the people of Australia, yet in doing so they have said they are not increasing taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a very adverse reaction to this in my electorate. I was making the point that the government had promised there would be no new taxes. I noticed that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) suggested increasing the HECS charge. Students, upon graduation, become liable for payment of part of their fees, about 20 per cent, when they hit certain income levels. Senator Vanstone is contemplating increasing that HECS charge. I think it is quite devious of the government to suggest, `We can increase the HECS charge on students but this is not increasing a tax.' HECS was imposed as a specific, highly targeted tax on students. I have to say it caused a lot of difficulty within the government at the time, but we did it for the sole purpose of increasing student places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The then opposition came out during the election and said, `No new taxes,' being very critical of Ralph Willis, the then Treasurer, when he would not give an undertaking on the tax fear but said that what the Labor <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2101"> government promised to do was to maintain the same level of taxation&mdash;not to increase the level of taxation. But the then opposition did not say that. They said, `No new taxes.' Yet they are suggesting that they can get away with, for example, increasing the HECS charges or, alternatively&mdash;as in this bill&mdash;moving to put a three per cent tariff on a whole range of domestic goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is no wonder that, when the people of Australia are asked to rate certain professions, politicians are, I regret, sinking lower and lower over time. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might feel that there is a degree of glee on this side of the House that the government are so clearly breaking an election promise. But their lack of probity in this matter, their lack of honesty, is harming us all as members of this House. I think we all have an obligation&mdash;as, indeed, the new Speaker has suggested; as the Prime Minister has evinced that he would like to see in this House&mdash;to lift the standards. When you get a mandate like yours, if you want to lift the standards, be consistent with what you told the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You told the people of Australia back in March that there would be no new taxes. Here we are today debating a new tax, a new three per cent tariff. The suggestion from the Chief Opposition Whip was that a tariff is not a tax. As I have said before, you are raising so many hundreds of millions and, if you go to my electorate of Chifley and to the electorate of the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), the shadow minister for health, and ask the people in those electorates, `When you pay more for a whole range of consumer goods when the government is collecting over $300 million extra, is that a tax or isn't it a tax?' overwhelmingly they are going to say that it is a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasing the government take from the hip pocket nerve is a tax. It does not matter whether it is a wholesale sales tax, whether it is income tax, whether it is company tax, whether it is tariffs or whether it is an excise: when people are paying more out of their hip pocket, they see that as a government tax. When you get the budget revenue committee sitting down, as doubtlessly they are doing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> right now, what do they look at? They look at income tax, they look at company tax, they look at excises and they look at tariffs. That is what makes up the government revenue. That is what ordinary people consider to be taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolute humbug, absolute tripe, to come into this House and suggest that when you impose a three per cent tariff&mdash;when there was no tax, no excise, no tariff there before&mdash;it is not a tax. It is a tax. The people of Australia, I am afraid to say, will see it that way. They will see any denials by government members as so much sophistry, as so much obfuscation and, in a sense, as so much political dishonesty; and they will punish you.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my friend the honourable member for Dobell said, it could be Lindsay; it could be tomorrow in Lindsay. I ask government members: do you want to go into a by&hyphen;election in Lindsay and suggest that, when you collect $338 million in year one, $358 million in year two, $393 million in year three and $413 million in year four, that is not a tax? Do you really expect to win in the electorate of Lindsay by running on that platform? Do you think the voters in a by-election in Lindsay are going to accept it if you say, `We promised we were not going to introduce new taxes but we are going to increase HECS?' Do you think they are going to accept that government grab that will punish students&mdash;not to provide extra places, mind you, because you proposed to contract the number of places, not to increase them? Do you think that when you go into Lindsay and say, `We are going to increase HECS,' people will not see this as a tax grab and that they will not punish you? Of course they will. You went into the election and you won it handsomely, as I have acknowledged, but you said, `No new taxes,' and the people of Australia believed you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is little wonder that the opposition has moved an amendment&mdash;I think a very good amendment&mdash;which seeks to draw you back to your election commitments. I can say with absolute confidence that every member on this side of the House will be voting for that, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2102"> notwithstanding the fact that it was a very handsome win. We will be voting for it because we believe that if you make statements, whether it is the opposition or whether it is the government, to the people of Australia, you are duty and honour bound to fulfil them. In putting this bill up, you are breaking it. You are breaking it in the first year of government. I think that members of the coalition just have no understanding of what a calamitous path this is to be breaking election promises on taxes so early in their government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that speakers have talked about the $8 billion black hole. The truth of the matter is that the Prime Minister&mdash;and I regret this&mdash;has never tabled in this House a costing by Treasury or Finance of his election promises. I think it is fair enough to suggest that we did not leave a balanced book&mdash;I do not think anyone argues that on this side&mdash;but the truth is that it is nothing like $8 billion. But in trying to assume the moral high ground, the government of the day has never had the decency to live up to its suggestion implicit in its charter of budget honesty that it would table the costings of its election promises. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know, and I know, and most members of this House know, that that approximates $4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is good enough for members of the government to be running around saying, `We're forced to break our election promises of no new taxes. We're forced to introduce this bill that breaks our election commitment of no new taxes,' because it will not wash with the people. There is an old saying that you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time. It is true that the people have given the government and the incoming Prime Minister a very generous honeymoon period, but just as they have been generous in their mandate and generous in the extent of the honeymoon period, deceiving the people of Australia, trying to dupe the people of Australia, is not a good long&hyphen;term strategy. I regret to say that I am totally confident that the people of Australia will not treat this very lightly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I take up the suggestion of the honourable member for Dobell. If and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when there is a by&hyphen;election in Lindsay, let us campaign on this. Let us have a referendum on whether it is appropriate for governments to break their election commitments and whether it is appropriate for a government to say, `There'll be no slashing of government expenditure.' Let us contrast what those on the other side said during the election period with what they are doing in government. Let us contrast their commitment to no new taxes with what they are doing in this bill and what they are proposing in the budget. Let us have a referendum on that in the electorate of Lindsay. That is probably very unfair to the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), but it is an appropriate test. It is an early opportunity for the government to get feedback on their actions. As the honourable member for Dobell has suggested, I invite you to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am appalled by this bill because of the damage it does to all of us as members of parliament in breaking election commitments. I strongly support the amendment that has been moved by the opposition. As I have said, the amendment merely seeks to redirect the government back to its original election commitment and to ensure that it does not break its promise by having a bill which imposes a new three per cent tax on consumer goods.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Customs Amendment Bill 1966 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1966, I have the honour of representing the electorate of Kennedy which produces probably $2,000 million annually in export earnings from mining and a further $1,000 million&mdash;arguably, $2,000 million&mdash;from agriculture as well. If we are talking about $3,000 million a year in export earnings from that very small proportion of the Australian population, then clearly we take very seriously the imposition of an extra three per cent cost upon our industries and their international competitiveness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at our mining and agricultural industries in Australia today. The sad fact is that in the four years leading up to 1989&hyphen;90 there was a growth in agriculture of 14 per cent over that period. Similarly, there was a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2103"> growth of 25 per cent in mining. Over a four&hyphen;year period these two giant industries increased by 14 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. If you go back through time, they are the average figures that you will find in those two industries. Every four years there is an increase of about 10 per cent to 20 per cent in our earnings from those two sectors of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last four years leading up to the 1993&hyphen;94 financial year, instead of getting a 14 per cent increase for agriculture all we got was a 1.9 per cent increase. In other words, growth in the agricultural sector has stopped completely. Instead of getting a 25 per cent increase in production and income from mining, all we got was a 3.6 per cent increase. In real terms there has been a decline in income from mining and agriculture over the last four years&mdash;one of the very rare times that has happened in our history. I daresay you would have to go back to the time of the Great Depression to find a precedent for that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not wish to canvass tonight the reasons for that dramatic collapse in our export industries. I point out to the House that our former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, used to make scathing reference to Australia no longer being an extended quarry or a giant sheep run. These comments, of course, were untrue. I simply refer to the heading `Exports of major commodities' which appears in table 2 on page 3. If you go through the list of those commodities you will find that the income from agriculture is 29 per cent and that from mining is 64 per cent. In other words, the much maligned extended sheep run and giant quarry that Mr Keating so happily used to refer to are supplying 93 per cent of the nation's entire income. But that income is drying up. Instead of an increase every four years of 14 per cent and 25 per cent respectively, we now have an increase of 1.9 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively. I urge the government to please understand that saddling these industries with extra cost structures is not the direction in which we should be travelling.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be fairly hypocritical for you to say true when your mob had a five per cent increase in the pipeline. I would not be butting in and provoking me if I were you. One of the ways exporting industries in Australia are punished is through punitively high interest rates&mdash;they are still around 12&half; per cent for business loans. We find ourselves competing against countries like the United States whose business loans last time I looked&mdash;that was some time ago, I must admit&mdash;were around six per cent. The net result of this enormously high interest rate is propping up the Australian dollar. When you are trading at a loss of nearly $2,000 million every month and the value of your dollar is rising there is something very wrong with the way the economy is operating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am known for not hesitating to make criticism where criticism is due, but I do not in any way wish my remarks to be construed against the Treasurer (Mr Costello) because it is very early days yet. I think it would be irresponsible for him to take precipitate action, in terms of his portfolio responsibility, as early as the present moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the Treasurer and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), who is in the chamber, to point out to the frontbench that we have very high interest rates in Australia. For over a decade we have had an enormously high interest rate regime which has artificially propped up the Australian dollar. I am on record applauding Mr Keating when he floated the Australian dollar. We knew it would sink, and sink it did. It sank from around 100c in the American dollar to 59c in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That enormous collapse in the Australian dollar scared the hell out of Treasury. It raised interest rates to enormously high levels&mdash;in excess of 20 per cent&mdash;and it started buying Australian dollars on the world market. I am not saying that there was not a case for propping it up a bit at the time. When the Australian dollar was allowed to free float, it immediately sunk to 59c. That was when this country had a debt of around $60,000 million. This country now has a debt many times greater than $60,000 million. It is some three times that figure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2104">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If when the debt was only $60,000 million and we were trading a lot more successfully than we are at present&mdash;our current account was nowhere near as high as it is now&mdash;and the Australian dollar still sank to 69c, then clearly if it were allowed to free float when we owe nearly $200,000 million and our current account deficit is nearly $2,000 million a month it would sink well below 59c. I do not think anyone looking at the figures would seriously believe that the Australian dollar, if allowed to free float, would rise any higher than 50c.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the dollar is hovering just below 80c that means that all of our exporting industries are being cheated to the tune of about 50 per cent of their present incomes. We are talking here about huge amounts of money. In the electorate of Kennedy, if we assume that we are exporting in excess of $3,000 million worth of product a year, that means we are being cheated out of $1.5 thousand million per year. If the dollar comes down to 50c then we will receive 50 per cent more for our product than we are receiving now. Heaven only knows, the cattle producers and the wool producers of Australia could desperately use that money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The copper industry is facing upheavals as a result of the machinations of speculators in the international marketplace. There have been a lot of articles about what has happened in the copper industry. One copper mine in Mount Isa earns some $1.3 thousand million a year. That mine would have an increase in its income of around $500 million or $600 million a year. A town like Mount Isa, which has suffered a lot of pain over recent years, could desperately utilise that money. I always make the point that if the unions are doing their job then that money should flow down to the average worker and employee in Mount Isa and circulate in the economy of that town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the western parts of Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, we see so many towns in a desperate state of decline, so many industries on the ropes after the body blow imposed upon them, yet we have a tool at our disposal right now to help them which is simply a reduction in interest rates. That would bring <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down the Australian dollar. If they got a fair go and if we stopped a practice that is grossly unfair to the exporting sectors of the Australian economy, which is based in regional Australia&mdash;that is, this constant propping up of the Australian dollar&mdash;it would result in an increase in income to every single western community of some 40 or 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can argue that the customs tariff bill only imposes a tax of three per cent on a small percentage of the cost structures of our mining and farming enterprises in Australia. That is true. We saw an increase in fuel taxes of some 20 or 30 per cent in real terms over the last decade imposed by the ALP government. We saw a 100 per cent, and in some cases a 200 per cent, increase in land rates for our pastoral industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each of these small cost impositions is eating away at our international competitiveness and imposing cost burdens which are rendering these industries non&hyphen;viable. We see today that probably one&hyphen;third of our pastoralists in Queensland, our cattle and sheep men, are in an almost terminal situation financially. We look forward to the coming debt summit which will try to help us. I emphasise the point that, while each of these little items may be small in itself, taken collectively, they indicate a huge increase in the cost burden placed upon rural industries in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To turn to agriculture for one small moment to compare our cost competitiveness in Australia with that of our major international agricultural competitor, the United States, let us go through each of the cost input items to farming. The first one is a sad reflection upon the industry, because the biggest cost input to farming is interest rates. As I said before, the last time I looked, the United States farmer enjoyed interest rates of around six per cent, and our farmers' rates are 12 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2105"> The next cost input item&mdash;and I am proud of this fact, not ashamed of it, as it is an excellent thing&mdash;is labour costs of $10.50 per hour in the state of Queensland. I imagine they are roughly the same in the other states of Australia. California, the biggest agricultural state in the United States, enjoys labour costs of $4 per hour: less than half the cost in Australia. That is not something to be asham ed of; it is something to be proud of. All the same, it is a 100 per cent higher cost imposition than that in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third cost input item in the state of Queensland, and also, I think, in New South Wales, is water. Again, in the largest US agricultural state, California, water cost $3.90 per megalitre, the last time I checked up on the figures. It costs $29 per megalitre in Queensland, a nearly 1,000 per cent difference. The fourth item is fuel and, even if we take the tax off fuel, it costs 42c per litre in Queensland&mdash;or in Australia, if you like. In the United States, fuel costs 26c per litre. Finally, the fifth major cost input item is fertiliser. In the United States, urea costs $206 per tonne; in Australia, it costs $396 per tonne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every single one of those cost input items is between 40 and 1,000 per cent higher than those of our competitor, the United States. People say that we should do something about that, but it is impossible for the farmer to do anything about the cost of water, since the government sets the cost of water. It is impossible for the farmer to do anything&mdash;not that he wants to&mdash;about the cost of labour, because that is set by the government. It is impossible for the farmer to do anything about interest rates, because they are set by the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue very cogently that our failure to legislate for the oil industry is the major reason that there is such a huge cost difference between ourselves and the United States, where they enjoy the benefits of the really wonderful anti&hyphen;trust legislation introduced by Theodore Roosevelt specifically to smash up the oil companies in the United States. We do not enjoy such magnificent legislation in Australia. That is why we pay 42c per litre for our fuel and the United States farmer pays 25c per litre for his fuel. I would say that similar anti&hyphen;trust legislation&mdash;or anti&hyphen;monopoly legislation, as we call it here in Australia&mdash;for the fertiliser industry would also see a dramatic reduction in the inexplicable difference between the cost of fertiliser in the United States and the cost of fertiliser here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can see why we are non&hyphen;cost competitive in agriculture. I know that the budgetary <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problems for the government are very serious and very significant but, seeing us imposing another three per cent, I must come here tonight to put the argument and the case for our exporting industries&mdash;the agricultural and mining industries of Australia&mdash;which are reeling on the ropes at the present moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The biggest town in the electorate of Kennedy, Mount Isa, has suffered a population decline of probably a third of its population. Most certainly it was over 30,000 and now it is hovering around 20,000. The reason for that is that Mount Isa Mines has just had to adopt almost skeleton staffing levels because times have been very, very tough in the mining industry. One of the reasons times are tough is the cost impositions applied by government in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We keep screaming about the subsidy levels in other countries and there is no doubt about the subsidy levels in sugar, which is a huge commodity in my electorate. We compete on the world market against the world's biggest sugar producer, and biggest sugar exporter as well, the European Community, and the farmers in the European Community enjoy subsidy levels of 192 per cent. It is incomprehensible to me, but even in Thailand farmers and industry enjoy subsidy levels of nearly 100 per cent, which is extraordinary, but that is the reality. They enjoy a price that is twice as high as the world price of sugar, and that is paid to them by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other issue that I wish to canvass tonight. Government is searching for revenue. You can say it is the eternal quest, something like the quest for the Holy Grail, one of those things we search for but never find: the happy taxing arrangement. Someone putting me down recently likened me to Billy Wentworth. Ironically enough, I am a great admirer of old Bill Wentworth and I think that he was one of the finest intellects that proceeded through this House. I most certainly saw his work in Aboriginal affairs, and he was one of the very few ministers for Aboriginal affairs that ever achieved anything significant in that portfolio. Mr Wentworth has been very strong, as has Mr Santamaria in his column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, on the issue of primage. All of the federal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2106"> government's income until the First World War came from primage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board tariff, which is GATT neutral&mdash;I can quote the section from GATT that says that this is allowed&mdash;of seven, eight or 10 per cent on everything coming into this country would enormously help the Australian economy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No&hyphen;one pulled the honourable member for Kennedy back into line when he talked about the wages paid to illegal immigrants in California. As is my right, I made a brief passing comment to it. Having cleared up that issue, let me say that it is amazing how this government thinks that the electorate is gullible. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, this was the government that said that there would be no new taxes. Although the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) referred to the `read my lips' line, it is not quite the same as `read my lips'. Indeed, some might suggest it is far worse, because it is yet another broken promise from this government with its 100 days of broken promises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much was made of that promise in the electorate. When I went around the electorate during the election campaign, I was told that the then opposition had embraced all the policies that Labor had been embracing for 10 years, and the one thing that was constantly put to me when I went around to workshops and other places in my electorate was that this government was the government that was going to have no new taxes. However, it has many new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the days of the election campaign, the then opposition members, especially the leader, now the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), were running around the country, appearing nightly on television and being quoted in the newspapers promising no new taxes. As I said, there is going to be a tax that was not there. It is a tax of three per cent on something like 17,000 items. It is a GST on consumer imports, but the government will not tell the people, or indeed us, just what items are going to be slugged with this three per cent tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So not only is it a consumption tax, but it is also a mystery tax&mdash;a little bit like Russian roulette. The consumer buys something and, bingo, he gets a prize. Sometimes he does not get it, but sometimes he gets the mystery prize. What does he get? He gets an additional three per cent tax. It is a bit of a mystery <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2107"> and the prize is the three per cent tax on the items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's decision to extend the changes to the tariff concessions will mean that all consumers will now pay the government three per cent more on the purchase of a vast range of products&mdash;some 17,000. It is a very wide&hyphen;ranging list of items, including electrical appliances, sporting equipment, and even gym equipment. Those who go to the gym here each morning to exercise, such as the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and others, would find that if those items were being purchased now, there would be an additional three per cent tax on them. Musical instruments, domestic hardware and a whole range of things are included on the list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I keep saying, and as other members have said, it is important to remind the people of this. The Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, and the now Treasurer (Mr Costello) gave a categorical assurance to the Australian people that there would be no new taxes, no increase in taxes and no changes to the tax mix&mdash;and that last one is very important. Within three months, the government has blatantly broken that promise with what, in effect, is a GST on imports. Every time families go to the toy store or the domestic appliance store, they will find the Treasurer's hand in their pockets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting how this change came about. When it was first mooted, it was going to be a tax on business. There was an outcry from the business groups to change the decision to remove tariff concessions from business imports. Indeed, one of the coalition ministers actually admitted that it was dreadful to tax business. The government decided not to tax business, but it is going to tax the consumers instead. The mates are going to be supported, but the poor old consumer is going to be hit again and will have to pay this tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A range of items is going to be taxed&mdash;some 17,000. Although these 17,000 goods will have a three per cent tax on them, there will be no tax at all on some goods coming through customs at Australian ports. I refer specifically to drugs, pornography and firearms. Why will there be no tax on them? It is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because at ports such as Port Kembla, customs services have been drastically reduced under this government. Brian Toohey summed it up very nicely in last weekend's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS>. He referred to nine&hyphen;to&hyphen;five smuggling when he outlined how Customs officials prevented $10 million in cocaine reaching the streets through the port at Hay Point near Mackay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is very important because we are going to have officials in Customs checking on some goods to make sure that three per cent is paid income. However, other ports such as Port Kembla, which is one of Australia's busiest ports, will not be so lucky because the customs officers there have been decreased from 12 to five as part of a review of shift work designed to save money. Customs officers will no longer work on weekends or at night time at Port Kembla or Newcastle even though ships are often unloading at these hours. A reduced number of staff will be on duty at Sydney wharves. As one customs officer put it, `You'd have to be dead unlucky to get caught bringing something in during office hours, let alone at the weekend.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has said that the new Customs Service will work through high quality intelligence and surveillance that will happen outside of office hours. They will have some sort of surveillance camera. But what will happen if someone comes in on a Friday evening? The surveillance camera will capture it but the customs officers will not be able to pick it up until Monday morning at 9 a.m. So the surveillance camera will capture unidentified people leaving the wharf on the Friday evening, but it will not be until Monday morning that anything can be done about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been much talk here and in the media about the credibility of politics and politicians. Former opposition members had a very strong platform throughout the election campaign that there would be no new taxes. There is now a question regarding their credibility. Do they take the people of Australia as fools? How can we, as politicians, have any credibility when we tell people that there will be no new taxes and then break that promise? Some members of the government have said today that this is not really a tax. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2108"> When is a tax not a tax? If it is not a tax, what is it? It is a slug, a slug which will bring in something like $400 million each year. What is that? Is that a windfall? Those opposite can call it what they will, but to me it is a tax by a different name. It is yet another broken promise by this government. I very much support the amendment foreshadowed by the opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has always said that he wants to establish a relationship of trust with the Australian people. He has said that he wants to establish a bond whereby the Australian people can rely on his words and his promises. This customs bill and scores of other broken promises have shattered that trust. This bill and scores of other broken promises have shattered that bond. This bill is another broken tax promise. It is a three per cent tax on consumers. We know it is a tax because the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has said so. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  on 2 April Mr Moore conceded that it was totally correct to say the removal of tariff concession orders was an extra tax. There it is from the minister's mouth that this is a tax. That ends once and for all any question as to the status of this particular measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a tax, it is completely contrary to the coalition's tax promise. They were the party prior to the election that would never introduce a new tax. They would not change the tax mix; they would not increase any tax. But barely 100 days into the Howard government we have a broken tax promise before the parliament which will place a three per cent tax on consumers. All those valuable items in the households, in the pubs and clubs and on the sporting fields of Australia are to be levied with an additional three per cent tax. This government has decided, contrary to its election promise and what the former government was intending, to place a three per cent tax on consumer goods imported to Australia where similar goods are not produced within this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is, in this debate, again trying to construct its alibi for a breach of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> faith with the Australian people, an alibi by which a broken promise can be justified. Of course, the coalition always alludes to the fiscal position. But we know too well that this is the standard tory method in Australia for breaking promises. It was patented by Nick Greiner in New South Wales in 1988 and was then tried on in Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia. It is the standard message from the conservatives, who make promises only to break them. They come into government and say that the cupboards are bare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tomorrow, we are having the report of the Commission of Audit. It will be bodgied up to try to legitimise things, to try to create the alibi by which this coalition government can break its promises. But the truth has come out: when the member for Higgins, the Treasurer (Mr Costello), made the allegation on 12 March, he said that the parameters had changed and that the problem was that the forecasted growth had slowed. The problem has now been corrected by the March quarter national accounts and, apparently, growth is going gang&hyphen;busters. Even the Prime Minister has acknowledged as much in a very open account to the international bankers when he said that the Australian economy was in good shape. Let me quote from that conference in Sydney on 3 June. The member for Bennelong had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incoming Government inherited an Australian economy . . . that was a little better than just good in parts . . . We have had 19 quarters of positive economic growth . . . low levels of inflation, and we continue to enjoy the benefits . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian people are quite entitled to ask this basic question: if things are so good and the Australian economy is in such good shape, why do the cuts need to be so big? If the Australian economy is in such good shape, why do tax promises need to be broken, and why does the parliament need to consider this new three per cent tax on consumers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is seeking an alibi, an alibi that the Prime Minister has blown with his admission that things are in good shape. There is no reason to break the government's tax promises. We are now to believe that the five minutes of economic sunshine that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2109"> Prime Minister spoke of in 1995 have turned into the year's longest day of economic growth, the longest growth cycle in the nation's modern history. We have also had an understanding in recent times of the $3 billion hole that the coalition has dug for itself with its uncosted election promises. So much for transparency on the budget! The government will not release the Department of Finance costings on the $3 billion worth of coalition election commitments made prior to 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting thing in relation to the fiscal position is that the coalition itself, throughout the course of 1995, became the poachers in the Senate, knocking $2.3 billion of revenue off the Commonwealth budget. The poachers, of course, have come into this House and said that they are the gamekeepers. But the gamekeepers are the ones trying to bodgie up an alibi by which they can break their promises to the Australian people. It was the member for Bennelong, supported by the member for Higgins, who throughout the election campaign chanted across the nation their mantra of no new taxes and no tax increases. They did everything within their power to chant that mantra&mdash;everything, bar asking the Australian people to read their lips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, at the Press Club before the election, the member for Higgins said, `It is not our agenda to introduce new taxes. It is not our agenda to bulk up currently existing taxes.' Bulk up? He is a tax hulk, breaking out of his suit with enthusiasm to tax the Australian people. This legislation reveals very starkly one fundamental truth in Australian politics, and that is this: how can anyone take the coalition's mandate seriously, if the coalition does not itself respect it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the coalition does not respect its own mandate, its own solemn promise to the Australian people, not to introduce new taxes, such as the one contained in this legislation, how can the Australian people and this parliament respect it when it comes to provisions like the privatisation of Telstra and the labour market deregulation bill? The coalition has always claimed a mandate on those issues, but it has no mandate on any issue unless it is prepared to respect its own promises. It is an absolute act of disrespect to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliament, to the Australian people, to all the businesses and to all the taxpayers, to introduce this legislation into the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing is broken promise after broken promise. It was very interesting, in relation to this question, to recall the words of the Prime Minister on the John Laws program just before the election. He was asked, `If you were given a choice between keeping all your promises and running down the budget or breaking promises and bringing the budget back into surplus, what would you choose?' The Prime Minister said very clearly that, given that choice, he would keep his promises at any cost to the budget. That proves one basic thing: you cannot trust the Prime Minister on his promise to keep his promises. That is how bad it is. He is breaking his promise to keep his promise on no new taxes. This is a three per cent consumption tax that is being levied across most of the sectors in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the election, the Prime Minister said on the John Laws program, `I am desperate to be an honest man.' That is what he said: he is desperate to be an honest man. He can't be too desperate this evening, because as consumers throughout the country pay their three per cent impost they will not think that the Prime Minister is desperate at all; and they certainly will not think that he is honest. They will think that he is a sneak, a welsher, a promise breaker, someone who made all those election promises for one purpose and one purpose only; that is, he made them to be broken. When he put his hand on his heart and said to the Australian people, `There will be no new taxes under a Howard administration,' he made that promise only to break it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One needs only to recall the debate in the House earlier. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) accurately described this tax as a mystery tax. So much for respect for the parliament ahead of the executive. The parliament does not even have an indication as to which items this tax will be levied on. There is one report in the media that 17,000 consumer items throughout Australia are to be affected by this legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2110">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism responded to the suggestion of a mystery tax by saying that it is actually a mystery ball, like the Shane Warne ad, where they bowl the mystery ball and it darts through the hotels and the houses and across the sporting arenas of Australia and comes back and bowls Ian Botham. I can appreciate why the minister for industry was saying that it was a mystery ball, because his own delivery on this has bowled the Treasurer middle stump. He has rolled the Treasurer on this measure right through the cabinet process, and bowled him middle stump. He joins a long list of state and territory leaders who have been doing that in recent times. For the poor old Treasurer, it is duck after duck after duck as the middle stump is knocked back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all well and good for the minister for industry to joke about this being the mystery ball that he has bowled to the Treasurer, but I think the comparison runs a bit closer to the bone. In that cricketing commercial the mystery ball starts out by going through the houses of Australia. It is very interesting to note that the mystery tax will be doing exactly the same thing. The mystery tax will be going through the houses&mdash;through the windows, through the doors&mdash;placing a three per cent consumption tax on all household items. It is a tax on baby walkers, battery operated dolls, bone china goods, can openers, candlesticks, coffee grinders, dolls' shoes, dolls' strollers, food blenders, microwave ovens, electric trains, food processors, knives, lint removers, men's and women's shavers, quilts, rice cookers, squeaky toys, toy music boxes, toy vehicles, toy washing machines, vacuum cleaners, video games and yoghurt makers. They are the sorts of items which will qualify under this three per cent consumption tax; they are the sorts of items that will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does the mystery tax turn to after that? It crosses the sporting and playing fields of the nation. As it does there is a three per cent tax on baseball equipment, basketballs, bicycles, electronic dart boards, exercise cycles, golf club grips, golf club practising machines, gymnastic equipment, ice hockey skates, javelins, discuses, knee guards. All <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these items are subjected to a three per cent mystery tax. It covers pogo sticks, pool toys, skateboards, skipping ropes, soccer balls, softball bats, table tennis balls. The list goes on. All these basic consumer items used on the playing fields of Australia go up by three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know what the impact will be, because the mystery tax will be crossing the electorate of Werriwa. There is no more important activity in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney than what happens on the playing fields of Campbelltown and Liverpool. All the families who participate in and love their weekend sport will be affected adversely by this three per cent consumption tax. So the mystery tax will be passing across household items, across the sporting fields and across the sporting arenas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, even the Christmas decorations will be taxed. Not only in the pubs and sporting clubs but also in the households of Australia, the price of imported Christmas decorations will go up by three per cent under this government, yet it promised no new taxes. `No new taxes' was the Prime Minister's promise to the Australian people at the 2 March election. This legislation goes out of its way to hurt Australian families. This is the legislation that the coalition said it would never introduce to this House. This is evidence that under this government it has become a dog's life for Australian taxpayers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2111"> and consumers. It has become a dog's life for all Australians affected by this high taxing government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often said&mdash;and it is a bit of a cliche&mdash;that you cannot teach an old dog new tricks. That is not what they are saying at the Treasury these days. They have been teaching their old dog plenty of new tricks: new tricks like a $1.2 billion GST on the states; new tricks like a consumption tax on the Australian public, as contained in this particular legislation. Speaking of dogs, it is worth quoting what the member for Higgins said on 30 January:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here is the big difference between us and the government: Mr Willis wants to increase taxes. We don't. That is the big difference between us.</PARA>
<PARA>This was not a promise that was sundry to the election campaign. This was not a promise which was a matter of trivia in the public debate. This was a promise that the Treasurer was willing to stake his reputation on during the election campaign. This was a promise not to introduce taxes, not to change the tax rates, a promise upon which Peter Costello was willing to stake his reputation. He made this the defining issue of the 1996 federal campaign. He said that the big difference between Labor and the coalition was that Labor allegedly wanted to increase taxes and the coalition did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that defining issue, on the issue on which the Treasurer has staked his reputation, he stands condemned by this House. He stands condemned for misleading the Australian people on tax policy. They are suffering from tax fraud. They are suffering from the tax grabs of this government. This legislation is only part of the pattern of higher taxes under this Howard&hyphen;Fischer government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a government that said at the election that it would not introduce taxes, what have the Australian people had to face? They have had to face an increase in the Medicare levy, a $70 per annum impost on taxpayers&mdash;a one&hyphen;off $500 million tax increase for the coming financial year. Beyond that, they are now facing the prospect of the state Costello taxes. We know they are Costello taxes because Jeff Kennett said he would name his state taxes after his dog, so they are state Costello taxes. That amounts to a $650 million tax grab that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will hit the average taxpayer in Australia by $150 per annum. That is a $150 per annum tax grab that the government said would never happen. It promised that these things would not be placed before the parliament at state or federal level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact is severe. The price of beer is going up. Cigarette prices are going up. There will be levies. People in Victoria are now talking about Peter's poll tax as they face the prospect of a land levy to pay for the way in which the Treasurer abused the Premiers Conference process. Beyond that, the Treasurer did not get what he wanted. He really wanted a $1.2 billion GST on the states. So there is an increase in the Medicare levy and there is the state Costello taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business and self&hyphen;funded retirees have also been affected because they have been swindled on the uplift factor on provisional tax. The coalition promised six per cent but they have legislated a permanent rate of 10 per cent, which is now before the Senate. That is a $540 million tax diddle. It is a $540 million tax grab over the three years of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that, the Treasurer thinks he has got away with imposing a sales tax on government cars&mdash;something that will cripple the car industry in Australia. It is a tax grab of $100 million per annum. There have been those four clear areas of broken promises relating to tax. Now there is a fifth, the measure which stands before the House&mdash;that is, a tax grab of $500 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do the Australian people come to understand the tax scorecard of the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government? How does that scorecard stand tonight, after barely 100 days of this administration? It is the Medicare levy, $500 million; the state Costello taxes, $2,000 million throughout the life of this parliament; the uplift factor on provisional tax, $540 million throughout the life of this parliament; the tax on cars, $300 million. This bill is a startling $1.5 billion over the next three years. The total tax scorecard for the Howard-Fischer government is a startling $5 billion throughout the life of this parliament. For each taxpayer in Australia that equals $625 over the next three years or $210 per annum.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2112">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the bottom line for all those battlers, all those families, all those taxpayers who put faith and trust in the member for Bennelong, who is now the Prime Minister. The bottom line, barely 100 days into his administration, is they are $210 per annum worse off, including the measures in this bill, than when this government started on 2 March. It is all before this government gets serious with its August budget. It is all before it even gets into the serious debate it wants to have on the GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not so long ago, on 2 May, the Treasurer said in this House: `I must say, there is a lot of economic sense in a GST.' So he is keen, as the coalition has always been keen, on the idea of a goods and services tax. Just this morning, in the national press, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> there was an article headed `Howard keen to encourage debate on GST'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Australian taxpayers are $210 per annum worse off under this government, under the five broken promises on tax that we have seen already. This is before they have even warmed up, before these National Party gentlemen opposite even get keen on tax. This is a big taxing government that has made the average Australian taxpayer $210 worse off per annum after barely 100 days, and the GST is still to come. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Since you are asking the question, I will answer it. I have been in the chair on many occasions when the two phrases&mdash;`Beazley's black hole' and `Costello con'&mdash;have been used and in a spirit of equity I have allowed them both to be used because they are not referring to the individual. They are referring in a descriptive manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I asked you to refer to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer by their correct titles was that you did not say `Beazley black hole' or `Costello con'; you referred to John Howard and Peter Costello. I will try not to interrupt you again, but I would be grateful if you would refer to honourable members by their correct title.</PARA></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be very happy to, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think the point is well made on both our parts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the now Treasurer (Mr Costello) constantly referred to their claim that they would bring to Australia `honest government', and that they understood the parameters of the budget process. The opposition leader at the time, the new Prime Minister, many times said that, no matter what Treasury estimates turn out, he would honour his promises to the Australian constituency and work his way through the budget proposals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2113">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have&mdash;all this done, of course, under the pretence of bringing to people `honest government'&mdash;100 days into the show a litany of broken promises, a litany of taxes and imposts on the Australian community. We had at question time here today the rather bizarre notion constantly reinforced by both the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Treasurer that the $1,500 million worth of forced handovers or trade&hyphen;offs coughed up last week by the state Premiers was not a new tax from the federal government, that it was not an impost from the federal government. In fact, the Deputy Prime Minister said many times that they are state taxes and they will be responsible for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every state Premier is now out explaining to their people that there is either what they are calling `a Costello tax' or `a new federal government levy'. Never in 13 years of Labor government did we see this process reduced to the farce it was last week, and never did we see the state Premiers, Liberal and Labor, unanimously referring to a process as amateurish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another aspect of this legislation that I want to refer to briefly. One of the subsidiary items in the legislation is the restoration of agricultural use of diesel fuel in the mining of limestone to qualify for the diesel fuel rebate&mdash;something which we are quite supportive of. There is no problem there, but it does raise this issue of the diesel fuel rebate. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you represent a regional or rural electorate, as I do. You well understand that it is not just the farm sector which has received assurances about minimal change to the diesel fuel rebate. That is where they see themselves at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fishing industry is still waiting for some assurance and the mining sector is now cranking up its lobbying effort in town because it has not been able to get the same assurances. Of course, the reason limestone mining is suddenly being classified a little bit differently is that it is the farmers who use the lime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is it about this government? It seems to have a cabinet that is prepared to make special provisions for farmers but not for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> miners, has not yet declared itself on fishing, and certainly is not interested in the broader issue of diesel fuel excise in the transport industry. There is something going on over there. I suppose that&mdash;as the Deputy Prime Minister, who is the leader of the National Party, said at question time today&mdash;all will be revealed on 20 August. We will be waiting, with interest, to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was bemused by the position that came out of the Premiers Conference: bemused by the about&hyphen;turn by state Premiers on the issue of general purpose grants versus sales tax on cars, for heaven's sake. I saw the Prime Minister interviewed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> and observed his comment&mdash;which I believe to be true&mdash;that, prior to the Premiers Conference, he discussed some of the measures with Premiers and they all indicated to him that they regarded their general purpose untied grants as sacrosanct in the process, saying, `Okay, if you have to do things, we will go with you. But, for heaven's sake, leave us with our untied grants.' That is how the Prime Minister explained it on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. That is why it appears to be such a dramatic about&hyphen;face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that the Premiers suddenly regard sales tax on cars as far more significant than untied grants? Look at the proposal as it came from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. I notice the Premiers have all been very keen to pin the tail on the donkey&mdash;in this case, the Treasurer&mdash;yet somehow did not really couple the Prime Minister with responsibility for it, but he is in there as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I very well understand that they did not understand where this impost bites most. I will tell you where it bites most: it bites most in regional and rural Australia, where there is a list as long as your arm of community based organisations and town operations. For instance, the hospitals, the senior citizens clubs, the councils and the fire authorities&mdash;particularly regional fire authorities, such as the CFA in my state, Victoria&mdash;all buy cars and vehicles with a sales tax exemption. All of a sudden, all these operations have to pay sales tax. In a party which is in a desperate state over things like the National Party's inability to come to grips with native title&mdash;</PARA>

We know because every year from 1983 Treasury and Finance used to serve up to us stuff like `Let's have a GST', `Let's knock off the diesel fuel rebate', `Let's knock off the sales tax to government and non&hyphen;profit organisations who need these things'. They would serve it up every year. Even Peter Walsh, who would certainly be regarded as the toughest Finance Minister Australia has had in the last two decades, would say, `Go <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> away with that.' But who fell for it? The novices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line here is this: the government should not expect the opposition to take kindly to a deal where they have wandered around Australia promising honest government, going on national television, pointing to Ralph Willis and ridiculing Ralph Willis for being honest enough to say on national television that no tax mix can remain immune from change, leaping onto that and saying that the former Treasurer has really admitted that there may have to be an increase in taxes, and then so publicly, on every front page, promising right across the nation `No changes to taxes and no new taxes'. They are now wondering why we are going to focus on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By gee, we are going to focus on it. We are going to focus on it in every public meeting we go to. We are going to explain the Costello con in every public meeting we go to. We are going to explain how people have been listening to what I call populist cant and they have now been confronted with Liberal&hyphen;National reality. That Liberal&hyphen;National reality is absolutely no different to 1977 when John Howard as Treasurer gave people tax cuts and three months later introduced legislation to take all the money back off them. Now people are understanding this and we are going to help them understand it a bit further&mdash;day by day, week by week, town by town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did a radio interview this morning on regional radio in central Victoria and we talked about the changes to education funding in these country towns&mdash;which are now represented by Liberals and Nationals&mdash;which are suddenly seeing their students facing up to increases in HECS charges and are suddenly seeing their job agencies such as Skillshare being wound back&mdash;all in the hundred days of the new honeymoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I don't think it is unreasonable to spell out the script. That is the script we will be working to. We will be pinning the government down to its rhetoric of honest government, no changes in taxes and no new taxes. We will be pinning the Prime Minister down to his very public statements that his number one priority is honouring his tax commitments, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2115"> honouring his promises. We will be pinning them down and we will be following this through, just having people understand what it is they have come to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important for those of us in this place and the close watchers of politics&mdash;the people who sit up in the press gallery and elsewhere&mdash;in looking at a situation like last week where the Premiers did a 180&hyphen;degree dance around, to ask, `Why is that so? How could that be?' The answer lies deep within&mdash;the split between the Nationals and the Liberals and their inability to come to grips with the fact that they represent all of Australia. The Nationals do not just represent country Australia. They have to embrace mainstream responsibilities in their thinking and the Liberals have to understand that their responsibilities are broader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not reasonable for you, after wandering around Australia, to threaten, or promise, in fact, to cut public spending and get rid of public servants. All of a sudden you have landed in the job and have come to face the reality that 85 per cent of public servants do not live and work in Canberra. They live and work in places like Bendigo and Ballarat&mdash;in my region&mdash;Bathurst, North Queensland and Western Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2116"> That release, put out in the dead of night as it was, was fundamentally a broken promise of a key coalition commitment to the Australian community at the last election: no new taxes, no tax increases. The amendment which the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the shad ow minister for industry, has foreshadowed in respect of Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1), reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill breaches the government's election commitment that it would not increase existing taxes or introduce new taxes and should therefore be withdrawn, redrafted and re&hyphen;presented in a form in which:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) goods for personal consumption on which tariff concession orders apply continue to enter Australia free of duty; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) no change be made to the duty rate which currently applies to policy by&hyphen;laws.</PARA>
<PARA>The fundamental issue so far as we on this side of the House are concerned is that the three per cent impost on consumer goods is a fundamental breach of an election commitment and a fundamental breach of the Prime Minister's compact with the Australian people.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was followed on 30 March by a call for a GST by Mr John Ralph at an Australian Institute of Company Directors forum in Western Australia, my own state. The article was headed `We need a GST: Ralph'. Then we find in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 8 April the article `Business lobbies Howard for a GST'. The article said that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry was lobbying the Prime Minister for a reintroduction of a GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 15 April&mdash;the articles are now coming thick and fast&mdash;was the story headlined `Summit to boost GST campaign'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The GST resolution was passed despite the reservations of the party's elder statesman and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2118"> former federal parliamentary leader, Mr Ian Sinclair, who said it "ignored the consequences" of the tax debate in the lead&hyphen;up to the 1993 election.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to see that the right honourable member for New England was at that conference when others were absent. The coup de grace occurred today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> . The Prime Minister has gone from not wanting to talk about the GST in a second term, but the headline states `Howard keen to encourage debate on GST'. It ties in appropriately with the bill before the House where we find a three per cent tax on all those consumer items. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Debate on the need for a goods and services tax (GST) is now something that the Prime Minister says he wants to "encourage".</PARA>
<PARA>We now find the Prime Minister encouraging an active debate on the GST. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Mr Howard's comments are certain to raise questions about the Government's position on a GST for the second term. A GST has only been ruled out for this term, and the Government has made no comment about next term.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to refer to the Western Australian member for O'Connor, Mr Wilson Tuckey, confirming with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS>  last night that he would formally raise the issue of tax reform at today's government party meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short period since the election we have consistently found that there has been an ongoing effort on the part of those associated with the coalition, members of the coalition and, indeed, the Prime Minister himself, to actively encourage and engage in a debate which would see the reintroduction of a GST. It is appropriate to link that notion with this bill because the key component of this bill, which the opposition opposes, is the extension of the TCS to consumer goods as well as to business inputs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred to the list of consumer items which the TCS will apply to. As I have said previously, one estimate is that as many as 17,000 items could be the subject of the new three per cent impost. In his opening remarks for the opposition on this bill, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) made the point that in addition to this being a breach of promise so far as the coalition's commitment to no new taxes and no tax increases was concerned, in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> addition to it being effectively part of Fightback by stealth, this can also be regarded as a mystery tax on the basis that the parliament does not have before it a full and proper understanding of all the items which it has proposed will be covered by this particular measure.</PARA>

This occurred after a scrap in the cabinet between the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and the Treasurer. That was a scrap which the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism won.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. A few days ago an article appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  headlined `Premiers unite for attack on Costello'. So the attack that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism successfully launched on the Treasurer pales into insignificance given the attack which the premiers have recently launched on the Treasurer. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  on 14 June the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, is quoted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We did not accept being locked into the Federal Government having access to a growth tax&mdash;we were never told before the election that they were going to impose this tax on the States.</PARA>
<PARA>If you were an Australian consumer you would be excused for having exactly the same <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2119"> response to the legislation before the House. Mr Brown, the Premier of South Australia, is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Commonwealth&hyphen;State relations have never been as low as they are now" . . . "the Commonwealth Government is trying to impose on the State governments and local governments a GST (goods and services tax) through sales tax".</PARA>
<PARA>So we find a consistent theme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> at the beginning of this week there was an article titled `Howard moves to back embattled Costello', by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> correspondent Glenn Milne. It makes a point of the Treasurer being done in by the state premiers and spends some time going through the member for O'Connor's comprehensive position paper on a consumption tax, which he produced at his party meeting today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we find a consistent theme in all these events: a broken election promise so far as this consumer tax is concerned, and no indication to the states so far as sales tax increases are concerned. Both these items are able to be regarded as Fightback through the back door, Fightbackdoor and GST by stealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It can be seen as an increasing and growing agenda on the part of the government to encourage a debate on the introduction of a GST, leaving itself the space to introduce a GST in the course of this term or any other term that the Australian community might be unfortunate enough to be lumbered with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These items are strongly opposed by the opposition. The reason for that is succinctly found in the amendment proposed to be moved by the member for Hotham. The bill breaches the government's election commitment that it would not increase existing taxes or introduce new taxes. It should, therefore, be withdrawn.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and my other colleagues have spoken at great length and have outlined, quite significantly, the issues related to this customs bill and its implications for Australians as a first step in the road towards a consumption tax. I want to put it in a broader context and look at this bill <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in terms of its implications for the so&hyphen;called rock solid guarantee that no worker would be worse off under the Howard government. For so many reasons that rock solid guarantee is crumbling, and this bill adds to that impression of crumbling. It is just another fissure in that rock on which that so&hyphen;called rock solid guarantee is based.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the matters before this parliament at the moment, we find, in the industrial relations arena with the workplace relations bill, proposals that will directly adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers, particularly those in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania and, indirectly, throughout Australia through its attack on the three pillars of living standards of Australian workers&mdash;the Industrial Relations Commission, the award system and the right of workers to organise in their workplace. There you have one direct, immediate, adverse consequence for Australians in terms of their attempt to cash in on the rock solid guarantee that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave before the election&mdash;that no Australian worker would be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very hard to convince the people I have met in workplaces, particularly those in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania, confronting these changes, that they will not be worse off. It is very hard to convince the more than 9,000 Australians in the Public Service who have lost their jobs that they are not worse off under this government. It is a very difficult argument to persuade those individuals, who thought they had a career and now find they are in search of a new career, that they are not worse off under this government. It is very hard to convince those people who will be paying the state taxes and charges flowing from that absolute debacle we had last week which went under the name of the Premiers Conference. It was nothing more than a debacle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">State taxes and charges are flowing from that conference. I noticed the New South Wales Treasurer talking about the Howard and Costello tax that he was introducing, very reluctantly. With similar reluctance, the Premier of Queensland, the governments of Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2120"> Western Australia will be moving either to introduce new taxes or to cut services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we all know is that the taxes available to the states are inherently inequitable and regressive taxes. They do not have available to them the progressive taxes which are constitutionally the right and responsibility of this Commonwealth parliament. When you force the states to move in the direction of increasing their taxes and charges, the burden of that is principally going to fall on ordinary working men and women who are battling to earn an income and support their families. It is very hard to convince those people in those circumstances that they are not going to be worse off under this government&mdash;that after 100 days that rock solid guarantee is of much value to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the advocacy of this government is&mdash;and some states may respond in this direction if the press reports are correct&mdash;that they should not increase their taxes and charges; they should cut their services. All the evidence makes it very clear that the activity which government undertakes which does most to increase the equity in our society&mdash;that is the most effectively redistributive&mdash;is the way in which the government provides services, the expenditure of money raised on the provision of services. Services, by their very nature, predominantly go to Australians most in need&mdash;not everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to be rigorous in the review of expenditure and rigorous in our analysis of how revenue should be raised in terms of both efficiency and equity. Essentially, forcing the states to put up charges and to cut services is about making ordinary Australian men and women who depend upon those services to enhance their income, to provide opportunities for their children, health services for their families and support for their ageing parents suffer. Those are the things which are under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they are under threat those ordinary Australian workers do feel worse off. They do not feel that rock solid guarantee is giving them the security they felt they were guaranteed. All that occurs before we come to terms with this bill. Wages and conditions are under threat; jobs are under threat; state taxes and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> charges are forced up; services are cut; and the chance of people seeing opportunities for their children, such as getting into universities, is under threat. Against all that background, we now find a $100 million tax on consumer goods&mdash;a three per cent tax on consumer goods in blatant breach of the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did hear some very loyal backbench members of the government trying to say that this is not a tax. To the credit of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), he said, `It is unquestionably a tax on business.' So when it was proposed to abolish the tariff concession orders on business the minister for industry said it was a tax on business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now it is proposed to abolish the tariff on consumer items. It is very hard to argue that it is not a tax on consumers. The line of logic that would lead from the fact that it could be a tax on business to the fact that it is not a tax on consumers is a very tortured line of logic. If it is to be pursued it will be interesting to watch as a historical phenomenon in terms of tortured logic but not of any other contribution to the debate in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we have to do is look at what are the criteria that any ordinary citizen might say constitutes a tax. They would say, `I went to buy this item and, as a consequence of a decision of the government, the item was more expensive than it might otherwise have been. I had to pay not only money to the person who provided me with the good but also something extra which went to the government. The combined effect of the payment to the provider of the good and the payment to the government made the good more expensive than it otherwise would have been.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Roughly, most people would say, `If that is the circumstance, we think we have been paying a tax.' It is money compulsorily paid to the government over and above the price of the good which you are receiving. By any reasonable measure, it is a tax. Consistent with the previous description by the minister for industry, it is a tax. So if it is a tax, how then does it not constitute a breach of that other promise about no new taxes, no increase <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2121"> in existing taxes? If something wasn't the subject of any government revenue raising activity before this bill, it is the subject of government revenue raising after this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether you want to call it a new tax or whether you want to call it an increase in the existing tax is an interesting semantic point of very little practical significance to the people who are paying the bill. One way or the other, if you have made a promise of no new taxes and no increase in existing taxes, you have broken one or half of one, depending upon how you define the extension of an existing tax to new goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More or less we have in that balance of items which affect the rock solid guarantee a very tried and true conservative government formula: you fight unemployment by sacking people and you fight inflation by putting prices up. I have never found either a very compelling argument. In combination they have never worked anywhere in the world, but that is what we have. We have a government saying its primary obligation is about jobs&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity to say, through you, that the minister would be very pleased, I am sure, in three years time to face up to these three benchmarks, because he has added a third to the two to which I was referring. One is: how did their job creation over the last three years of their government compare to the job <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> creation of ours? Did they create 700,000 jobs? The minister seems enthusiastic to be tested against that benchmark and we are very pleased to accommodate him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second benchmark is: how have Australian workers gone under the rock solid guarantee that no worker would be worse off under a Howard government? The third benchmark is: how does the promise stand, `No new taxes; no increase in existing taxes?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think on those three benchmarks they will be found wanting. But I do thank the minister for his proposal that I should add the third to the list because it is something which, over time, we will regard as important. There are other benchmarks on economic performance and performance of this government which we will put down in time and against which we will want to see the government measured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody in this place understands, or should understand, that governments need to raise revenue and that there is no popular way to do it. Increasing taxes is one way of increasing national savings to increase government revenue. There is no popular way to do it. No&hyphen;one has ever been applauded for raising a tax, for raising a charge or for any other measure for increasing revenue. At least no&hyphen;one has ever been applauded by the people who pay. You can sometimes get applauded by the people who do not have to pay if you impose the tax on someone else. I think there was a Queensland premier once upon a time who said the only good tax is a Commonwealth tax. There are many taxpayers who would say the only good tax is one somebody else has to pay. But revenue is important and this is about raising revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's quibble is not with the fact that the government has an obligation to raise revenue. After all, we made similar proposals which we would have implemented if elected. Our concern is that this is a revenue measure, a significant part of which this government promised it would not take. So this is, unequivocally, a broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham's second reading amendment to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill has as its fundamental justification that it is a proposal to say that we in the opposition will support the revenue measures that this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2122"> government put forward in the election campaign as revenue measures they would undertake and not those they did not put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that there are some unpalatable aspects about this decision for which we could have won applause from business for opposing. On the application of the tariff concession orders to business, we could have done a little cheer chasing, taken the soft option and got some support in the business community for saying we were wrong, we have changed our mind and we are opposed to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having spoken for the former government for three years in the Senate, often on tax and revenue matters, this government when in opposition almost inevitably took the soft option on every occasion. We are saying we will support those parts which went to the people. We work on the starting point presumption, which will not apply on every occasion, that a government is entitled to raise its revenue as it chooses and be tested by the public at the election as to the manner in which it has gone about doing it. That is a fair starting point presumption. Sometimes the taxes proposed and charges and revenue measures are so unfair that one has to qualify that position, and we will reserve the right to do that. On some other occasions, they are so fundamentally, flagrantly in breach of election promises that you cannot support them and you certainly feel free from that general starting point presumption. This is certainly just such a case&mdash;`No new taxes; no increases in existing taxes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet we have this very long list of goods, which is the best list that the opposition can come up with because the government is trying to keep hidden its list of consumer goods that are going to be taxed&mdash;thousands and thousands of goods, many of which are bought regularly by ordinary Australians for their children and for themselves for the conduct of their household and their family recreational activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were not taxed before. They are not taxed now. It will make them worse off. They are worse off after the decision than they were before the decision. It is very hard to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> explain to the working men and women of Australia how that conforms with the contention that no worker will be worse off under a Howard government. Today they do not have to pay tax on these goods. If this bill passes they will have to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the rock solid guarantee is one benchmark against which this government will ultimately be measured. If you look at the breaches made by that already in people's wages and conditions, in their jobs, in the taxes and charges, in the services and in the opportunities for their children, you could say, `Surely after five strikes the government must be out; you must accept that this bill breaches the election commitment, that this bill breaches the rock solid guarantee that no worker will be worse off and that therefore the second reading amendment to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) moved by the member for Hotham should be supported.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having inherited this problem from the Labor Party after the election, we then found a very considerable reaction from the business community to another five per cent tax on inputs. There was to be a reduction and an add-on to costs. That is what you did for them. Needless to say, the business community had a few words to the government about the inequity of this new position they were in. With our being a reasonable government, we met with various interested business groups and discussed with them the impact of the proposed Labor tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to that, we met with people across the board and we discussed how much it would have cost business in this area. It would have cost them an enormous amount of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> money, and I am not surprised they were upset. Individual companies would be forced to bear additional costs&mdash;between $10 million and $25 million per firm. So quite naturally we had a look at what was going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they pointed out the implications of how this tax fell, we also found the enormous administrative problem that came with it. At no time in the hustle and bustle of the campaign did you bother to define what a business input was. You wanted to cover up the black hole. You had to get some money in after the election, so you did not define what a business input was and you did not define what a consumer good was. You just announced a broad decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we looked at the administration of this tax, we found that the only way you could bring in the level of business inputs was to spread it across certain areas&mdash;not to consumers. As a consequence of that, we found it was necessary to look at how this new tax would be fitted. As a result of consultations with industry, the government introduced a measure which would effectively reduce the government's proposed area by 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have reintroduced policy by&hyphen;laws so that national projects can continue without additional input. These are significant movements. People within the business sector were saying very early in the piece what a great job the government had done because it meant a considerable saving to business in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight people over there have been jumping up and down about consumer goods. I invite them to look at what this really means. The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), during the debate, alluded to the fact that gym equipment would come under one of the special areas. There are numerous areas which have difficulties&mdash;not only mobile telephones, television sets or the various other items that no doubt you would call consumer items. If these items are used within a business context, then they are outside the game. How are you going to define in terms of administrative simplicity a television set that is brought in and used within a motel or taken home for use or something like that?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other proposal does not recognise the fact that special areas of taxation apply to the TCF and car industries. The proposal put forward by Labor in the election campaign would have increased costs in the car industry by up to 15 per cent. In areas of the TCF, costs could have been  lifted to 37 per cent. These are the consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of the opposition's miscalculation&mdash;obviously done in haste during the election campaign, sent by the former Prime Minister down to the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) to give it the white stamp&mdash;was based on the assumption there would be a split of 70:30. The advice that I have is that the split between business inputs and consumer items is closer to 80:20. There is a huge difference between personal consumption and business inputs. The effect of this would be a difference in revenue of the order of $200 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the opposition that their whole argument tonight has been one of guilt. I know that they were about causing a considerable amount of trouble to the business community. There has been absolutely no attempt to consider any business costs&mdash;the cost to business generally and to individual companies. As a consequence of that, the proposals put forward by the opposition are really quite poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move now to the two&hyphen;part amendment that the opposition have put forward. It indicates that goods for personal consumption to which tariff concession orders apply should continue to enter Australia duty free. This takes them back to where they were before&mdash;the old five <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent. The coalition government has moved in and reduced that by 40 per cent. The opposition propose to make no changes in the policy by&hyphen;law. I remind the opposition that in this case they have absolutely no case because in the election campaign they proposed to abolish it completely.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I want to correct a technical point on an answer I gave today about CD price monitoring. Inadvertently in the course of my answer, I said that I understood the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission was carrying out a formal monitoring of sound recording prices. In fact, it is carrying out an informal price monitoring. It is yet to be determined whether it will issue a report. The difference is that it is an informal, not a formal, monitoring.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"the Bill breaches the government's election commitment that it would not increase existing taxes or introduce new taxes and should therefore be withdrawn, redrafted and re&hyphen;presented in a form in which:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> goods for personal consumption to which Tariff Concession Orders apply continue to enter Australia free of duty; and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2125"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> no change be made to the duty rate which currently applies to Policy By&hyphen;Laws".</PARA>
<PARA>I will not take up too much time of the House on this because I had an opportunity to speak in the cognate debate. This amendment seeks to restore integrity to the coalition government's position of no new taxes. It ensures that this measure does not result in a GST by stealth, which is what will happen if the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) goes through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy by-laws comprise the second string in the bow if people fail to secure a tariff concession order. Under us, the policy by&hyphen;law could still rate at zero, whereas your proposition can result in circumstances in which a three per cent rating can apply. For you to argue that this is what we proposed in relation to policy by-laws is wrong. We are seeking by way of this amendment to protect consumers yet still give to business a second opportunity to get the concession, the zero rating, through the policy by&hyphen;law rating mechanism. It is still possible under certain circumstances for them to get it in your case, but not in every case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your going to the election saying that you supported Labor's position is inconsistent with the second string of our amendment. Certainly what you are trying to do by way of imposing a consumption tax via this measure is completely contrary to what you said in opposition, what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has said, and in particular what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, which is that there will be no increase in taxes and no new taxes under a coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a new tax by any definition. It is a tax on consumers. The only person who says that it is not a tax is the Treasurer. The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) is now wagging his head in the negative. He does not believe that it is a tax either. Go and consult the High Court, and talk to the National Farmers Federation and industry. Your senior minister, who has the cabinet ranking, not you, has admitted publicly that it is a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not let us have any hogwash about there being no tax here. This is a tax. It is another example of a broken promise. You said that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you would not introduce new taxes. Whilst the minister was able to roll the Treasurer in relation to the tariff concession orders, all he did was pave the way for the Premiers to do the same thing last week at the Premiers Conference. That was another example of a broken tax promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are here to hold you accountable. That is why we are moving this amendment and ensuring that the proposal does not extend to consumers. It gives another level of protection to business, which you say you are keen to look after.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1995, Act No. 87 of 1995, the CELA Act.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The CELA Act made substantial amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 relating to the diesel fuel rebate scheme, to tighten the eligibility criteria for rebates of customs and excise duty paid on purchases of diesel fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of the Senate debate on the CELA Act on 29 and 30 June 1995, 80 amendments were successfully moved to the CELA bill as introduced. In the course of translating those amendments into a final royal assent bill, several substantive problems with the commencement and the application and savings provisions were created which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2129"> were acknowledged as contrary to the expressed intention of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The application and savings provisions problems arose because modifications were not made to these provisions to take account of amendments made by the then opposition and Greens, in particular relating to the law as it applied to quarrying and sand mining prior to 1 July 1995. Also, consequential amendments were not made to the commencement provisions even though it was agreed that particular amendments would commence at particular times. Several minor transcription errors in the CELA Act were also identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 29 August 1995, the then government introduced the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 into the Senate. The purpose of that bill was to amend the CELA Act to correct the transcription errors and the problems with the commencement and the application and savings provisions. However, the bill lapsed upon the prorogation of parliament on 29 January 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the exception of one proposed addition which I will discuss shortly, this bill is in substantially the same form as the 29 August 1995 bill and is being pursued because the need to correct the problems with the application provisions and restore the Senate's intention still exists, particularly in relation to the law applicable to mining for minerals. The CELA Act amended the definition of minerals by excluding certain materials, with effect from 1 July 1995 only. Any existing rebate applications or any matters before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the courts that relate to the use of diesel fuel in mining operations prior to 1 July 1995 were intended to be decided in accordance with the law as it existed prior to 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CELA Act as passed did not give effect to this intention and without the corrections to the CELA Act proposed in this bill, these applications will be governed by the amended law. The principal effect of the bill is to allow those companies which had lodged applications before 1 July 1995 to have them considered on the basis of the law as it existed prior to 1 July 1995, thereby restoring the original intention of the CELA Act. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Passage of this bill will make those essential technical amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill as introduced into the other chamber on 6 May proposed to make one minor addition to the CELA Act to restore diesel fuel rebate eligibility for the extraction of limestone for use in the de&hyphen;acidification of soil in agriculture, post 1 July 1995. The government's proposal picked up the recommendation of the then opposition senators and the Australian Democrats in October and November of last year concerning this important landcare activity. The result of the restoration of this diesel fuel rebate eligibility would have been to ensure that the cost of lime to farmers would not increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the committee stage of the bill in the Senate, amendments were moved by the WA Greens to remove the items of the bill which proposed to restore this category of rebate eligibility. The Senate agreed to these amendments. The Senate also agreed to amendments moved by the WA Greens to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This amendment inserted new section 75E into that act to provide for the payment of a cash rebate in respect of activities undertaken to prevent land degradation in years when deductions cannot be made from income due to lack of assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government did not support these amendments at the time, and remains of that view now. I foreshadow that the government will be moving amendments during the committee stage of this bill to reverse the Senate's amendments, and effectively restore the bill to its terms as originally introduced into the Senate on 6 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is proceeding in this way because it is convinced that the limestone amendment it proposed was appropriate and consistent with the other types of diesel fuel rebate eligibility. It costed the proposal and considers it capable of being controlled through the audit mechanisms which accompany the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The same cannot be said, however, of the Income Tax Assessment Act amendment for the payment of cash rebates for landcare activities which replaced the government's proposal in the other place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2130">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is advised by the Australian Taxation Office that the Income Tax Assessment Act amendment could cost around $7 million per annum. It is also important to note that the proposed amendment could distort a taxpayer's choice of the most appropriate mix of landcare activities to undertake. The amendment would allow those entitled to the cash rebate a greater benefit&mdash;100 per cent of expenditure&mdash;than primary producers who are currently claiming deductions under the Income Tax Assessment Act and who receive a tax benefit based only on their marginal tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also concerned with the precedent that this type of cash rebate scheme would set with calls for similar treatment for other rural expenditure elsewhere in the taxation system being difficult to quarantine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the scope for tax abuse in such a cash rebate proposal cannot be ignored. Providing cash rebates through the taxation system would cause significant administrative, compliance and anti&hyphen;avoidance issues. The government's opposition to the amendments proposed in the other place, for the reasons I have indicated, should not be seen as a criticism of the rationale behind the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, significant government resources are already being diverted towards landcare objectives in one form or another and many of these measures can directly benefit low income farmers. For example, many state governments provide low interest loans or direct subsidies for, or subsidise the cost of, soil conservation works. Similarly, the Commonwealth directs significant outlays into the national landcare program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, however, is one which has a different focus, the diesel fuel rebate scheme, and it is the government's view that it should remain restricted to that. I table the replacement explanatory memorandum and commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) has said, the main purpose of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 is to correct some technical and drafting errors encount <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ered in turning the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 into an act. It clarifies that, in relation to rebate claims under the diesel fuel rebate scheme made before 1 July 1995 and court or tribunal proceedings relating to such claims, the relevant law is that applying before that date. That was also the purpose of the predecessor to this bill&mdash;that is, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first 1995 amendment bill introduced by the Labor government implemented changes that we had proposed to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. In effect, the purpose of those changes was to tighten the eligibility criteria under the scheme. That became necessary due to extensions of eligibility over years through litigation and because of the refined definitions of agricultural and mining operations. As a consequence, we inserted a specific list of eligible activities into the legislation. It removed the eligibility for `residential purposes' and it narrowed the definition of minerals to exclude the eligibility for the extraction of certain substances because their extraction was not considered to be mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second bill Labor introduced last year sought to give effect to the will of the Senate when it passed the first bill. It is Labor's intention to support this legislation because, with one exception, it is what we proposed last time. It is in fact the legislation that should have passed the Senate last year. It should have been operational over six months ago. That would have happened but for the interference by the then opposition&mdash;the now government, which is bringing it back in&mdash;and the minor parties in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was originally, as it should be now, just a correctional bill. However, the opposition and minor parties in the Senate used the opportunity to raise substantive issues of eligibility under the scheme, despite the obvious technical emphasis of the bill. For example, they sought to have the diesel fuel rebate for limestone extraction reinstated. We had removed this in the first 1995 amendment bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also sought to oppose the removal of the offshore petroleum industry's eligibility under the scheme. They sought to oppose new <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2131"> requirements that certain mining activities be conducted solely for mining purposes to qualify for a rebate under the scheme. Due to the hold up in the Senate, including the reference of the bill to the Senate Economics Committee, the bill did not pass. It lapsed when the election was called earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's new bill before the House now, as it was introduced into the Senate, did contain one difference to our original bill. It sought to reintroduce eligibility under the scheme for limestone extraction&mdash;but for agricultural use only, that is, the extraction of limestone for use in the de&hyphen;acidification of soil in agriculture. Obviously, this resulted from backbench pressure in the coalition ranks. It will have the effect of adding an additional $620,000 per financial year to Commonwealth outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We took the view that the limestone extraction, for whatever purpose, should be excluded from eligibility under the scheme with effect from 1 July of last year. Essentially, we took the view that limestone extraction was quarrying and not mining. I think that on any sensible reading of the definition that is a legitimate position to take. Given that the rebate under the act is available under the scheme only for mining operations, we thought it appropriate to exclude it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We moved to close off the expansion of eligibility under the scheme which had been spawned through much litigation associated with the scheme. It had taken the operation of the scheme, in our view, beyond its original intent. The current government now seek to reintroduce eligibility for extraction of agricultural use limestone on top of what we proposed but they opposed last year when we introduced it. It is our intention not to oppose the government on their bill in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Senate, the Greens successfully moved amendments opposing the reinsertion of limestone. But their amendments went further because they also provided a new tax rebate for farmers for certain landcare activity. In the Senate, we supported the Greens but have now considered their position more closely. It is not our intention to continue to support them, mainly because their proposal was totally unfunded, it is likely to be a very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> costly one and tax deductibility for landcare activity is already available to farmers under tax legislation. In any event&mdash;and I reiterate what the minister said in his second reading speech&mdash;that is not what this legislation is about. This legislation is about correcting technical errors in our first 1995 bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has indicated that the government will be moving amendments here restoring the bill to its original position, or at least not accepting that which the Senate has proposed, that is, restoring eligibility under the diesel fuel rebate scheme for extraction of agricultural use limestone and negating the Greens' other amendments. We will support the government's bill with those amendments. We do so because, apart from the limestone provision, the bill will give effect to our 1995 changes. Those changes were important and necessary to ensure that the scheme was more effectively targeted at those the government intended to benefit from it, not others who were able to argue expanded interpretation of eligibility criteria through the courts&mdash;a very expensive process in terms of the litigation as well as the impact on outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the government is now supporting the passage of legislation to which it was vigorously opposed last year. It is also interesting that it has picked up only one of the concerns that led it to take that position in the Senate. Those concerns were raised by a number of the government backbench. They identified three areas of concern, and a number of newspaper reports have indicated that some are prepared to cross the floor if the government is not prepared to accede to the three of them. In fact, the government has indicated acceptance of only one of them. It will be interesting to see in this debate how some of those earlier critics respond to the other two areas of change that they proposed but which the government is not, in this legislation, seeking to pick up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2132"> I repeat: Labor is prepared to support this bill. But in supporting the bill, we wish to register our very firm opposition to the government's mooted cuts to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The coalition went to the election promising to maintain that scheme. The National Party's policy launch on 4 Feb ruary said, in very unequivocal terms, `The diesel fuel rebate scheme will be retained.' That is a very categorical quote. There is no equivocation in that. That was a total commitment to retain the diesel fuel rebate scheme. There were no qualifications in relation to its application to miners versus farmers. It was a commitment to retain that which was in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a coalition, they went further in the Liberal Party statement that was circulated to Australia's mining industry in the monthly mining magazine just before the last election. The question was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the coalition retain the diesel fuel rebate scheme?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. The diesel fuel rebate is an essential element of the international competitiveness of Australia's mineral, pastoral and other industries. The coalition will retain the diesel fuel rebate.</PARA>
<PARA>These were unequivocal statements of support before the last election. There was no shadow of doubt by any in the mining or farming sectors that the government would retain the scheme in its current form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet since the election there have been endless reports and speculation that the government is proposing to abolish that scheme, either totally or in part. We are not sure what real commitment has been given to the farming sector, but they have been a bit quieter since the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) addressed their national conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly nothing approaching that sort of commitment has been given to the mining sector. Indeed, I am aware of the fact that the mining sector is not very happy with the non-statement by the Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer, who was asked to reaffirm his party's support and that of the coalition to retaining the diesel fuel rebate scheme. All that Mr Fischer's response to the mining sector referred to was a preparedness to fight to retain it for farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, in terms of your position in the parties in this House, I am pleased to see that you are paying attention to this. I know it is of concern to you that in the National Party seats and in many of the regional seats which members of the Liberal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Party represent in this House there is real concern, certainly amongst the mining sector&mdash;and there is still some concern amongst the farming sector&mdash;that this scheme will be cut into significantly despite pre-election promises to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been trying to expose on a number of occasions the fact that, despite what the government said during the election campaign, it has no intention of honouring those promises. It is trying to argue that the changed financial circumstances mean that it has to take drastic steps. But I tell you this, Mr Deputy Speaker: there is one thing that counts in politics and that is honouring your word&mdash;to be prepared to go on the record not just once but on numerous occasions to restate your commitment because you know the importance of that issue to the constituencies concerned. You were not prepared to put in any qualifications during the election campaign. You were making your commitments categorically: you will retain the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Prosser interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite frankly, if you reduce the diesel fuel rebate scheme, you are in effect increasing the tax burden to businesses, which is the same as breaking your promises that there will be no new taxes. So not only have you rejected the specific commitment in terms of the diesel fuel rebate but you are caught on the general application, because it has the effect of lifting the general tax burden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope there are members on the back bench on your side who do take this issue up. It is a major concern. When I was the minister for primary industries, as well as when I kept an interest in the rural and mining sector while I held other portfolios in government, I took a very strong view that this was a measure fundamentally important to both the rural and the mining sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure was about recognising a correction&mdash;a correction by way of an input cost associated with the conduct of business in both the farm sector and the mining sector, an input cost that should not have to be borne as a result of a general excise measure. That was the rationale for it being introduced. It <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2133"> always made good economic sense because it was correcting the distortion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We never treated it from the perspective of it being purely a revenue measure. We understood the importance of it for supporting industry and, importantly, supporting those growth value adding industries that are so fundamental to our economy&mdash;industries that do not just extract the ore, do not just extract the mineral, do not just grow the produce, but have led significantly to export growth in not just the commodity but the value added product offered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is no small commitment. The diesel fuel rebate scheme is worth in excess of $1 billion to industry. From memory, about 57 per cent goes to the mining sector and the remainder to the agricultural sector. These are big amounts of money to struggling industries. In terms of the farm area and the marginalism associated with risk in the mining sector, these are significant decisions that determine whether or not that investment will continue to be had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to members of the backbench who are participating in this debate: understand that there is no opposition on the point of the bill, but take on board the point that is being made to you in relation to our questions in the parliament, our interventions in the debates. This diesel fuel rebate should stand on its own merits but, more importantly, if you have promised the electorate to retain it, you have to honour it. It makes sense on two counts: integrity as well as good economic sense. Therefore, lobby your side to ensure that they do not, for the sake only of cutting the bottom line, rip this scheme apart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has to be an understanding in government as to why you cut things. You do not cut them for the sake of it. You have to understand which schemes contribute to the economic wellbeing of this nation&mdash;which contribute to our export growth, which contribute to improving the current account, which contribute to job activity and, most importantly, which contribute to the growth of regions. There is no point pretending in this place that you are committed to regional economic development and diversification if you are going to strip away the very programs that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> help that. It is not just the diesel fuel rebate scheme, important as that is. It is things like the export market development grants scheme and the DIFF scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From day to day we see all this speculation about programs that are ready for the chop in terms of the ERC. The state premiers did not stand for the stupidity of the Treasurer (Mr Costello). I do not believe that members of the backbench forming part of the government in this parliament, significant in number as they are, should stand for that stupidity either. They should understand the effect of what is proposed in these other areas, take real notice of it and do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the election, as I said, we have seen countless reports of speculation that the government are going to either abolish or restrict this scheme or that it is going to apply to certain groups and not others. Time and again we have had relevant ministers in this House refuse to guarantee the future of the scheme. In fact, a few confusing signals have come out, which ought to give the backbench some heart that they can work on them. You have already had the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) rolling the Treasurer in relation to the tariff concession scheme. If you get your act together, you might be able to get someone else to roll him in relation to the diesel fuel rebate scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, the minister for industry, Mr Moore, indicated on 30 April that business and industry programs cannot be isolated from budget cuts and that some programs would have to be terminated. That was in the general sense of business programs. From a business perspective, that is laying the way open for some of these programs to be cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), who is touted from time to time as a future leader of the National Party and was making something of it last week in Taree in the leader's absence, actually defended the diesel fuel rebate as a non&hyphen;application of tax on production&mdash;not a subsidy. He is correct in that regard. He said that he would resist proposals to scrap the scheme. `Fuel is the lifeblood of our primary industries,' he said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 17 March.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2134">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was setting the rationale as to why the rebate should not be cut. He was actually reinforcing the point that I just made in this debate about it being a correction of a distortion, if you like&mdash;not a subsidy&mdash;effectively neutering the application of a tax because of its general application when it comes to the important component that it plays as an input into the lifeblood of the rural and mining sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is very interesting that since the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy made the statement on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program&mdash;he actually said that the diesel fuel rebate would be retained for farmers&mdash;every time he has been asked in this parliament to restate that commitment he has refused. His defence is that he is a member of the Expenditure Review Committee and that, therefore, he should not speculate on what the outcome of that committee might be in putting the budget together. The problem for the minister, though, is that he was a member of the Expenditure Review Committee when he made that statement on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. In other words, he was prepared to go on public television and rule out the cut to the rebate&mdash;make a big name for himself in terms of the rural sector&mdash;as a member of the Expenditure Review Committee, but he will not pay this House the same courtesy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all this pious comment from time to time as to how the government is going to raise the standards of this place, how it is going to make the parliament more accountable, how it is going to be more open with the people through the parliament, how the parliament is going to be supreme and not at the whim of the executive of government, but the first time the minister says it on TV he gets crunched. He comes into this place limply claiming every time he is asked the question that he cannot speculate. But he did speculate when he was a member of the Expenditure Review Committee as far back as 17 March, and he ought to have the decency to come into this House and repeat the commitment that he made, otherwise the farm sector that he represents is entitled to be concerned about what will happen to this scheme when the budget is brought down. But that is only in relation to the farm sector.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the minister has refused to do, and what the leader of his party has also refused to do, is to reassure the mining industry, the other big recipients of this measure. They will not give the mining industry an indication as to whether they are in there fighting for them or whether they are likely to be exempted. They are just totally blank. They are prepared to take the mining industry for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) wants to parade around the rest of the world saying how Australia is improving international access, how we are going to improve our exports, how we are going to improve our trade position, yet he will not give the reassurance that industry needs either to make new investments or to continue with existing ones and expand them. What sort of minister is he? He seems to think that all he has to do so is masquerade on the international scene and everything will follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor understood the importance of giving substance to what it was saying on the international scene. It was  prepared to back these industries, which are the lifeblood of the nation, with real support. It was prepared to go out to the regions and understand why they needed this additional assistance, and it was prepared to put resources into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have a government that goes to the election saying it will retain the scheme, but at every opportunity it has to defend that position it wimps. It wimps on every count. We will wait and see what happens. But all the signals are very discouraging, certainly for the mining sector and, one would have to argue, for the farm sector as well. The government has repeatedly refused to stand by those sectors. It has repeatedly refused to honour commitments made so forcefully and unequivocally during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the weekend, whilst he was not at the conference, the Leader of the National Party indicated that one commitment he makes within the budgetary process is that the National Party will fight to ensure that the diesel fuel rebate scheme for farmers is recognised. That is fair enough. That is not saying what the outcome will be. It is saying that he is prepared to fight for farmers. But <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2135"> why is he not prepared to fight for the miners? Why can't he include them in his commitment? This is the sort of reason why the mining sector is so concerned about its future. It is being given no encouragement whatsoever from the National Party and the Minister for Trade. The people who claim to represent these regions and sectors are being given no support. They are getting no other support from anywhere else on the government side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the diesel fuel rebate scheme is the largest of the government industry assistance measures. The year 1994-95, according to an Australian National Audit Office report, saw 213,000 claims approved from 110,000 applicants. The government paid $1.25 million in rebates. As I said before, 57 per cent of the value of the rebates went to the mining industry. The primary producers in agriculture, fishing and forestry received 32 per cent of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The value of the scheme to the mining industry cannot be overestimated. For example, it is considered that the mining sector will receive $551.2 million under the scheme in this current financial year. Excise taxes on diesel fuel are one of the mining industry's largest production inputs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister at the table, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), has brought to my attention the fact that, if the diesel fuel rebate is scrapped, mining costs in Western Australia will increase by 10 per cent for many operations. Total industry costs in WA would rise by about $400 million in 1996-97. Industry profitability would be cut by around 50 per cent and, with this, industry's ability to invest in exploration and new projects. We hear members all the time talking about the importance of these industries to the future economic development of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is no point talking rhetorically. There is no point saying you are prepared to support them with the practical programs if you are not. Inevitably, if this cut to the mining sector goes through, it will result in reduced production, in mine closures and in loss of exports and jobs. Exports of minerals and energy resources more than doubled in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this country from when Labor took office in 1983 until we lost office. It went from $9.5 billion to almost $20 billion. Investment almost doubled. Industry output was up by 125 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not just the mining sector that is under threat. The Grains Council of Australia, for example, estimates that removal of this rebate for agriculture will add something like $10,000 per year to the costs of the average grain farmer. I see the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) in the House. I am sure that farmers in her area will also be seriously affected. I know that she takes an interest in support schemes for those industries because she has spoken on previous occasions in this House about the traineeship scheme for dairy farmers. I congratulate her for it. I am very pleased that she is in the House. She should be in her party room asking what is happening to this scheme. Farmers in her area, which has seen a huge growth in agricultural output and value added products, will suffer. They know the importance of living on the margin. They understand fundamentally what impact any cuts to this scheme will have on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government are seeking to do by this bill is worthy. Essentially, it does what we wanted to do but what they opposed. I did want to take the opportunity in this debate to draw to the attention of the House that there is no point correcting the scheme by way of tightening it and making it more efficient if your hidden agenda is just to emasculate the scheme. There is no point pretending that you are into efficiency and making sure that only the right ones get it if you are then going to strip away the very means, resources and entitlement that many have so often relied upon in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a demand-driven scheme, in essence. It is going to increase with expansion in these sectors. It is a necessary consequence of the growth of the agricultural and mining sectors, and it ought to be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, who is at the table, takes on board these things. I doubt that he will have much sway in the cabinet room, but I have seen the effectiveness of the government's backbench over the last couple of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2136"> weeks in this parliament. I urge them to get behind this and reassure the mining and agricultural sectors in this country that they will honour their electoral promise and retain the diesel fuel rebate scheme.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to begin by reminding the previous speaker, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), that we are not debating the emasculation of the diesel rebate scheme or any other particularly skulduggerous attempts to remove it in some way; rather, we are talking about enhancing the effectiveness of the scheme for the benefit of the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government was voted into power largely on the rural people's concern and great distress about the way the previous government's business costs rose over the last 13 years so that business found it very difficult to compete internationally. Over the last 13 years there were rising rates of rural youth suicide. In fact, over the last five years those rates of rural youth suicide have doubled. So, far from the previous government enjoying a sense of enormous fellowship and joy when it came to the rural sector, if those in opposition got out there they would find that the rural sector is now enjoying the fact that there is a government that appreciates the costs of doing business and is doing all it can to assist primary industries and mining to be world competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is all about making sure that farmers can afford to apply lime as an agricultural additive to their land. We have an incredible history in Australia of managing to produce, in particular, crops and pasture from country which is largely not terribly fertile, especially when compared with our competitors in Europe or the USA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Up to the turn of the century and a little beyond, farmers were trying very hard to compete on international markets, but with very low productivity levels. They tried, therefore, to clear more land to produce crops over a number of years&mdash;until the invention of superphosphate. Superphosphate was a miracle for these croppers and pastoralists. When they worked out their equipment so they could spread the superphosphate along with the seed, they found their productivity <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increasing 10 per cent and more per annum for a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It meant that we produced a surplus of good quality grain, for example, that helped us to establish ourselves on the international markets as a reliable supplier of high quality cereal. Superphosphate meant that we could start to increase our dairy production to a point where we went well beyond our domestic needs. Again, we could start to develop our processing sector and put our processed product onto international markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So superphosphate was a miracle substance. It was not all that expensive because the governments of the day supported farmers by providing subsidies for applying that material. It was used in such a way that some of it entered into the watertables and the nutrient levels went up there and then it flowed into our streams. But that was not the biggest problem. Over a number of years, despite the ongoing application of the superphosphate, it was noticed that fertility levels were again declining. We discovered that we had what we now call soil acidification&mdash;a result of long-term use of superphosphate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with all things affecting Australia, we take problems in agriculture very seriously. After a period of research it was found that one of the most successful ways to overcome soil acidity was the application of agricultural lime, or calcium carbonate. The trouble with calcium carbonate is that you have to use it in fairly heavy doses&mdash;something like four tonnes per hectare&mdash;you need to use it over a number of years because it takes a fair time to be watered and absorbed into the soil process, and it costs about $50 per tonne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, you have to repeat the applications for quite a number of years. Soil fertility does not very rapidly improve but it does over time. Improvement is steady. To ask a farmer who is presently experiencing a downturn in trade to put something worth $50 per tonne onto his property is a big ask.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because it supports those who are mining the lime product and because they are then able to pass on the saving to the primary producer, this diesel fuel rebate is a very substantial measure assisting the primary producer to restore fertility to the country. It <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2137"> also means that over time the effects of superphosphate are less detrimental. As has been said, superphosphates can end up in our streams, leading to blue&hyphen;green algae outbreaks and the other results of nutrient laden waters getting into our major waterways. Fortunately also, the lime can be quarried throughout large areas of the country with fairly low technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to this bill gives us the ability to put back into the system access to calcium carbonate, or agricultural lime, which we believe will be of enormous benefit. In my electorate we produce something like $1.5 billion worth of export product. That product comes from agricultural land all of which over many years has used superphosphate. We also grow cereals. The cost of the diesel rebate for one year&mdash;which, as the previous speaker referred to, is something in the order of $2 billion&mdash;is not much more than the value of the export production of my electorate. When we look at it in those terms, the value of this diesel rebate overall is an extraordinarily good investment in our agricultural output.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lime is a natural substance&mdash;it is calcium carbonate. When we export products with a clean, green label we are in no way interfering with the concept that our primary production is without chemicals or artificial additives that could be seen to be detrimental, particularly to our Asian food markets. Furthermore, the diesel fuel rebate in no way could be challenged as being GATT inconsistent. It is not a subsidy; we are simply not applying an excise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in every way you care to look at this particular amendment, as our previous speaker said, there is a very important outcome. It is an amendment that all of us in this House could readily agree to. It is of great benefit to the environment because agriculture can be sustained as long as we maintain fertility and overcome the major problem of soil acidity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our primary producers often have to compete against corrupt markets, in the sense of having to compete against subsidised product. Costs of production in Australia are extraordinarily high. Our farmers need all the help they can get. In my electorate, the dairy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> farmers are competing against New Zealand to earn the title of the world's most cost efficient dairy producers. The availability of agricultural lime is of enormous value and benefit, so I very strongly support the previous speaker and, of course, my government in endorsing this amendment which will make agricultural lime a part of the diesel rebate scheme.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, in addressing this very important debate on the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, let me just commence by saying a couple of things. Firstly, I do not support the breaking of election promises. Secondly, I do not support the proposition that two wrongs make a right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having put those two positions in place, let me comment on some of the `pontificating' of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) in lecturing us on breaking promises&mdash;breaking promises, and then starting to talk about fuel tax! I have a reasonably long memory. I reckon that I went around Australia telling people that we had a tax proposal in Fightback that would remove fuel tax but impose a 15 per cent GST. I can remember the member for Hotham, joining with his then Prime Minister and others, saying, `We can do all of that; we can give you personal tax cuts, we can give you everything you want, and we don't intend to raise any taxes at all.' What was the result of that on their re-election? They put 6c a litre on the price of fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, when I was putting this proposition around Australia, I painted a little picture. The picture was of the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, being kidnapped by the KGB as a child and taken over to Russia for the purpose of being brainwashed and sent back to Australia to become a politician and wreck the Australian economy. I was able to point out that, as time went by, the trip was proved not to be necessary. The reality of it all was that, when they gave him his book of instructions to come back to Australia, on the front page they would have written in thick black texta `tax transport'. Why? Because Australia is just so dependent on it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2138">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the member for Murray (Mrs Stone), was at pains to point out the huge cost of transporting limestone, a product that has almost no value at all as it sits in a quarry somewhere. It is worth  only a few dollars a tonne. By the time it is delivered to the property that needs it the freight cost can be 10 times the value of the product in the back of the truck. That freight cost is directly proportionate to the amount of tax we apply to distillate. When the then Keating government, the opposition as it is now, added 6c a litre to the cost of fuel, the effects flowed through the entire economy. It put up the cost of groceries in the supermarket; it put up everybody's operating costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the fact that we have this legislation before us today. This is legislation which originally was aimed at making sure that certain areas of operation liable for fuel excise tax but avoiding it be brought to account. The original legislation, which was passed by the previous government, prevented some loopholes which a former tax avoidance industry was trying to establish. But here we are today making sure that such an essential product as lime, so ably referred to by the previous speaker, will not carry the burden of a fuel tax of 36c a litre&mdash;and that is up, as I recollect, from 6c a litre when we lost office back in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, having said that, we recognise the hypocrisy of these statements&mdash;this hand wringing, `Keep your promises.' John Dawkins, the poor old Treasurer who had to implement this thing, left the parliament because he was so ashamed. He had to go before the people and promise a tax regime like `l-a-w and no additional taxes' and then had to present his first and only budget which broke all those promises. So we do not want to hear any more about broken promises from the other side; it is just embarrassing. The reality is that we on this side have to keep our promises, and there is nothing more important to consider than the diesel rebate scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been around this parliament long enough to remember its history. In fact, when I first entered the parliament we had a very simple system of tax exemption for all off&hyphen;road use of distillate. It was as simple as that. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The entitlement was established by the issuing of a number which was quoted on purchase and which in fact applies today in the sales tax system. However&mdash;and I do admit it to be true&mdash;certain fuel agents, having obtained the number of a particular eligible client, maybe a farmer, started filling up trucks of other ineligible operators and then simply writing in the number that applied to one of their eligible clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was Doug Anthony who, having had this drawn to his attention by the department, introduced the current rebate system. To that point, off&hyphen;road distillate attracted no tax. It was not a revenue item; it was not an expenditure item. It just did not exist. I corresponded with Doug at the time, saying I thought there were other administrative alternatives. I argued for a plastic card which could be held at the point of delivery and franked onto the delivery documentation to establish the exemption right of people. It would not be available back at the depot to be used for some truckie. I thought that was administratively better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But suddenly, 10, 12 or 15 years later, from the moment we established the rebate scheme, which simply said that everybody pays the tax and those eligible get a rebate, we created a revenue item and an expenditure item. Of course, the expenditure item is now referred to by the bureaucracy as an outlay of government. It was never money to which we were entitled; it was never money that we took. We did it for administrative reasons. I felt it was a very complex and unnecessary system. But the bureaucrats knew where they were heading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I express my concern that in defence of the sorts of cuts that they should take in terms of their administration of our nation, they are saying, `There are other ways.' I do not doubt for a minute that they are coming to my senior colleagues and saying, `You don't need to take my job away, mate. We've got this expenditure item of $1.2 billion and you're committed to cutting expenditure. It's not a tax. The fact that you add 36c a litre to the operating expenses of farmers, fishermen or miners&mdash;don't you worry about that. My job <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2139"> will be secure and you can save up to $1.2 billion.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have got to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, my view is this: it is not an expenditure cut, if such a decision were taken. I am confident that we will stand by that promise, but if it were taken&mdash;and this is a message to the bureaucracy who I know promote these sorts of ideas&mdash;it would have a substantial effect on various sectors of our business community. It is the worst form of tax. As I said, it would have been the first one which the KGB would recommend for increase in the context of Australia, with its diversified and distant resource developments, spread all over the place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a huge cost. It must be recognised for what it is. I think the case has been put for farmers. They have a huge cost in cropping today. To be efficient within world markets, they use extremely large equipment. They no longer use horses; they no longer use little equipment. Manpower has been replaced by huge horsepower and large fuel consumption. They should not have to pay that when everything they sell is subject to international competition&mdash;often corrupted international competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us quickly move to the fishing industry. I have a constituent who sends three trawlers from the town of Geraldton to the Gulf of Carpentaria every year. The cheque he writes to fuel up those three trawlers, to get them there to fish for a week or so, is $600,000. If you were to add the 36c a litre to which the opposition raised the diesel fuel tax, you would then see his outlay go to $1.2 million, in order to position his boats and get them fishing for a product. Once, you could sell prawns or shrimps anywhere in the world. Today, there is huge competition from fish farming in Asia. They are no longer in a market where you name the price and someone takes the product. They are now in a market where there is intense price competition and they are only hanging in there by marketing their product as being fresh and from the sea, instead of raised in a mud hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then move to mining. Mining has been transformed. The fundamentals of mining today are no longer burrowing through the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> earth in narrow tunnels and finding the very high&hyphen;grade ores. We have gone back into all of those old workings; today we open&hyphen;cut them. That is achieved by shifting huge volumes of earth at very low percentage mineralisation. We have new technology that deals with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whereas the use of diesel fuel was minimal in many mining establishments, today it is one of their principal costs because they are shifting all this dirt&mdash;huge quantities. Everything is running around on rubber tyres. I was told the other day&mdash;and I will stand corrected if I am wrong&mdash;that the major fuel agent in Kalgoorlie now distributes more distillate than is consumed in the whole state of Victoria. I would not be surprised. It is massive&mdash;low grade, big volumes and very profitable for the nation. We see it in the massive rise in gold production and exports, paying off that international debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one talks about minerals, the most commonly heard phrase that is greatly misunderstood in the community is `recoverable reserves'. Recoverable reserves are not what someone has established as being the mineral in the ground. It is the amount of mineral you can get out at present day prices and present day costs at a profit. The minute, for instance, someone was to impose that fuel excise tax on the mining industry, every mine in Australia would have to downgrade their recoverable reserves. Salomon Brothers would be on the phone possibly downgrading Australia's credit rating because our assets had been diminished. Those that have a prospectus in the marketplace to start up a new mining venture would have to recall it and rewrite that component. Investors would, in many cases, see that. Every mine in Australia would have its life reduced by the imposition of that tax. These are the reasons why I know we are not going to do it. We have made a promise and we will keep it. Furthermore, it has got to be understood what a negative situation it would be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an argument of simple arithmetic. If you add 36c a litre, which would be a doubling in normal terms of the fuel cost of any business venture, and particularly mining, it is obviously going to have an effect on the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2140"> bottom line&mdash;the taxable profit. So the first thing government would forgo would be the 30c in the dollar company tax. Add to that whatever other rationalisation they attempted to achieve by sacking workers and everything and you would lose some PAYE tax. You would be lucky to recover 50c in the dollar anyway. These are the figures that bureaucrats do not always provide when they come up with these smart ideas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stand by our policy. Our policy was that we would not impose or change the arrangements of the diesel fuel rebate. It should not be changed for farmers, fishermen, foresters and miners. We show our credentials in this legislation by making sure that, although it might be perceived as an industry where you mine limestone for the purposes of building blocks, household construction or the creation of cement, there is a component that goes in very large quantities to rural activity. It is ridiculous to add to that cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Murray went so far as to point out the huge quantities required. When you are talking about 5,000 acres of land and three or four tonnes to the acre, an extra dollar a tonne is huge money. That is the sort of cost that people in my electorate are confronted with. They also do that with other sites of minerals of that nature. It is an environmentally good practice. It should never be forgotten that, when you apply these sorts of minerals and regenerate soil and its productivity, the soil is not deteriorating; it is not being abandoned. It is as positive a move as you can make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other product I was thinking of in that regard&mdash;it is now getting huge usage in my electorate&mdash;is gypsum. We recently had an argument about accessing a gypsum deposit because it had a few trees on it. My argument was that we are going to save a lot more soil out there than the little we are going to lose here. Again, we have to have a commonsense approach in some of those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome this legislation and I welcome the government's accommodation of the arguments that were put in the past parliament and in this one that these areas of taxation should not be applied to business inputs. In fact, it challenges the entire Australian tax <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system. I say to you, sir&mdash;I know that you are a very rational man; a person with whom I had a good friendship when we were overseas on one occasion&mdash;that it is time that the Australian parliament asked itself if the Australian tax system is adequate for Australians' needs. Is it servicing our business community? Is it giving state and other governments the opportunity to give decent services to those in need: poor people? My answer to that question is that it does not. But I can give you another answer: until this parliament&mdash;both sides of it&mdash;agrees that we must make a change, it will never occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was disappointed to hear someone who has the intelligence rating that the one&hyphen;time Senate leader is supposed to have brought to this House asking that silly question today: will you guarantee this parliament you will not have a GST until the year 3000? How stupid can you get? That is the greatest description I can give. I will forgive them some of their fibs and their broken promises, but do not come to this place being stupid. The question that should be coming from you people&mdash;I say this with respect&mdash;is, `Where can we get together on some of these important issues?' Where is the middle ground? Why can't we talk about tax in a sensible way rather than all getting around the corner and saying, `We'll fix them up. We'll start another fear campaign. Get Singleton in. Fifteen per cent.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really silly when you see people wanting for money. We have got ACOSS joining with ACCI now&mdash;that is a pretty good quinella&mdash;and what are they saying? `For goodness sake, look at your tax base.' We should not be calling the premiers over once a year and saying, `Put your hat out and we'll tell you what you get.' We should give them, firstly, the right and, secondly, the responsibility to raise some money in their own right and be answerable. You could do the same with local government. I have been there; I know how. But we will never do it while one side&mdash;whichever it is&mdash;decides that the politics are worth more than national responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Think about it. Go to your boss and say to him, `You could be a statesman. You really <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2141"> and truly could. You could go down in history as a leader who said, "Australia has a problem and I am going to join with the government to try to fix it."' Do not think that is unique. Just think to yourself: how many shares would we have sold in the Commonwealth Bank by now if we had wanted to be mischievous in opposition? We would have had your mob running for cover. We would have only had to say that we were agin it and there would have been riots in caucus. We were the first to raise the issue of privatisation and when it came down to tintacks and you wanted to do it we did not pull out all your old stories.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill, particularly in relation to restoring the diesel fuel rebate eligibility for the extraction of limestone for use in the de&hyphen;acidification of soil in agriculture. The introduction of this bill has been necessary to clean up a mess created by the Labor government&mdash;that is, the problems and anomalies in the Customs and Excise Legislation Amend <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ment Act 1995 following Labor's failure to implement amendments made by the Senate. I congratulate the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) on his statesman&hyphen;like comments in relation to the Australian taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The annual additional cost of restoring the diesel fuel rebate eligibility for the extraction of limestone is about $620,000, which, in terms of lost revenue, is negligible when compared with the substantial benefits that would flow from increased agricultural production after the introduction of limestone to reduce soil acidity. I notice that the honourable member for Page (Mr Causley) is in the House at the moment. He was once the minister for agriculture in New South Wales. He would well know the value of adding lime to soil. It is imperative that the government provide incentives to the limestone quarrying industry to extract limestone as economically as possible in order to make its use economically viable and to encourage farmers to use the product in greater quantities as a remedial strategy in the fight against acidity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total area of acid soils in Australia, defined as soils with a pH of less than 4.8, is about 29 million hectares, of which some 24 million hectares are used for agriculture. New South Wales, with about 9.5 million hectares of acid soils, is most affected, followed by Victoria&mdash;and I notice the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) had a lot to say about this&mdash;Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. These statistics are a stark indication of the full extent of the soil acidity problem and the ongoing need for it to be addressed by the introduction of limestone to the farming cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accurate diagnosis of acid soil infertility, coupled with sound advice on the need for lime and other fertilisers, is critical if farmers are to obtain the productivity gains needed to offset their costs. Using lime to raise the pH in our fine soils to a pH of around six is essential for optimum plant growth and an important tool in countering the negative impact of acid soils on future farm productivity and profitability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process of acidification is a natural one with soils tending to become more acid over a period of time. Australian farmers have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2142"> started with fairly acid soils and, in a bid for higher productivity through the use of nitrogen fixing legumes and nitrogenous fertilisers, farming practices have hastened this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farmers with a soil acidity problem basically have two choices to maintain productivity. The choice is between having a fairly high productive system and taking lime as an extra cost or taking a low intensive, low yielding system and using no lime, but their income will be reduced because of this. Farmers wanting to maintain the productivity of their land must use lime. The higher the system in terms of yields and inputs, the more lime is needed to maintain an adequate pH level. Lucerne growers, for example, have to look at liming as part of their regular costs because irrigation and high productivity tend to acidify the soil extremely quickly. The higher the returns the more it will pay to lime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major problems with soil acidification is that the more the pH is allowed to drop the higher the cost will be to rectify the problem. If the problem is allowed to develop to the extent that the subsoil is affected, there is no solution. Once the subsoil goes acid, only the most acid tolerant plants such as oats and sub&hyphen;clovers can be grown. Acidification of the subsoil is a form of permanent degradation, leaving a massive problem not only for today's farmers but also for future farmers and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big danger is that if farmers with soil acidity and aluminium or manganese problems do not start to use lime the soil will continue to acidify, which means that they will have to put on more lime and it will cost more money to increase the pH level. Soil acidity is an increasingly serious problem affecting a large part of the south&hyphen;west slopes of New South Wales, parts of which are in my electorate of Riverina.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to this problem the New South Wales Department of Mineral Resources has been actively undertaking a campaign aimed at identifying and assessing potential sources of agricultural limestone in the southern part of the state. This campaign has been in recognition of the need to develop new sources close to areas affected by acidity in order to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> substantially reduce the cost to farmers because of the lower transport cost component, and thereby encouraging greater use of limestone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to boosting sustainable agricultural productivity, winning the fight against increasing soil acidity has important ramifications for the environment. Poorer plant growth due to acid soils means less ground cover and the result is increased soil erosion which seriously damages the environment. Combating soil degradation is vital and is an important element of the coalition government's commitment to integrating the joint interests of sustainable development, especially in primary industries, and environmental protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rural industries will be among the main beneficiaries from new environmental initiatives taken by the government to comprehensively tackle the scale of the environmental crisis facing Australia. The environmental crisis we face as a nation has become increasingly stark&mdash;and increasingly apparent to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our land and water resources have been degraded over large areas of our continent and the unfortunate result is that the lifeblood of our unique environment is being drained and its productive potential over the long term is being diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems are real and they are diverse, with soil acidity a prime concern in a crisis which threatens not only our unique natural and resource assets but also our quality of life, our export potential and the jobs and opportunities for future generations of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real concern of Australians about our environment calls for real action that tackles the problems we face head on. The government has initiated that action by promising to establish a historic $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, which will be devoted to protecting and rehabilitating the Australian environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be a trust in perpetuity, held on behalf of all Australians, to enhance the quality of the environment in which they live. The overriding purpose is to ensure a cleaner, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2143"> greener and more sustainably productive Australia into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats, by their continued obstructionist tactics to block the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra, which will fund the $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust, will stand condemned by the Australian community if the government is unable to deliver on the huge mandate given to the implementation of the environmental package on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increased funding for environmental protection projects could result in the allocation of additional financial resources to enable more research into acid soils and their treatment to prevent further degradation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Charles Sturt University at Wagga Wagga in my electorate has been involved in ongoing research into soil acidity and Professor Jim Pratley, Dean of the Science and Agriculture Faculty, deserves special praise for the vital work both he and his team are undertaking in addressing this problem. During a recent visit to the university I saw some of the work they have been doing. It also promotes the importance of regional universities and the need to ensure that funding to those universities is kept at the maximum level possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, by restoring the diesel fuel rebate eligibility for limestone quarrying operations, has recognised the importance of the mining industry's contribution to the Australian economy. This contribution must be at the forefront of any debate on the future of the diesel fuel rebate and its application to the broader mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be emphasised the diesel fuel rebate scheme is not a subsidy&mdash;and we have already heard the member for O'Connor make that statement. It is a legitimate recognition of the fact that the mining and agricultural industries operate in remote areas, off&hyphen;road, and is an exemption from an Australian duty to ensure our exporters compete on a level playing field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian miners typically pay 27 or 28c per litre for diesel. This would increase to about 58c per litre if the rebate were abolished. The mining industry's competitors in countries like Indonesia or Chile pay only 20 or 24c per litre.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the mining and agricultural industries are the mainstay of the Australian economy and their export capabilities and earning power must be protected in the national interest. In many cases, the mining industry is a price taker and not a price maker, so any new cost imposts simply reduce the industry's global competitiveness and the end result is a detrimental impact on the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A case in point is the Normandy group, one of Australia's largest miners and its biggest gold miner, producing from its mines nearly 20 per cent of the nation's gold production. This company also employs about 5,000 people. The group's mines consume some 100 million litres of diesel fuel per annum and removal of the current exemption from diesel fuel excise would result in an additional direct cost of $30 million per annum. Nearly 100 per cent of mineral production is exported into markets where the price is dictated by global market forces and the seller is unable to pass on cost increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must never be forgotten that the mining industry is the single most important industry contributor to the Australian economy, representing nearly 40 per cent of Australia's total exports and operating in a world market where there are no safety nets. In 1993-94, in current price terms, mining gross product totalled $16.5 billion or 3.9 per cent of total GDP. This compares with 3.1 per cent in the rural sector, including farming, forestry and fishing; 14.5 per cent in manufacturing; and 78.5 per cent for all other industries. The removal of the diesel fuel rebate scheme as it applies to the mining industry would result in a cost impost of $700 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2144"> Because of the importance of resources to Australia's export trade, policies or actions which damage the international competitiveness of Australia's resource sector can have serious adverse implications for Australia's balance of payments. Increased costs mean higher cut-off grades and, as a result, minerals which at current fuel costs are economic to mine will become uneconomic and the impact will be disastrous in terms of closures of marginal mines, especially those small to medium sized mines which are already suffer ing under different policies of the previous government which we will have to overcome. Job losses will emanate from that, including the impact of a mining employment multiplier of over four to one, reduced export revenue, lower company profits depressing the share market and a reduction in government revenues via corporate and personal income taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must recognise that fuel substitution will not rectify the situation for mining companies. Most mines are in remote areas and are remote from electricity grids and gas pipelines. So it would be impossible to substitute alternative fuels for diesel even where technically possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already stated, almost 100 per cent of mine production is exported. In 1994-95 minerals and energy exports totalled $29.8 billion, representing 50 per cent of merchandise exports&mdash;goods only&mdash;and 40 per cent of total exports in goods and services. The strong performance of the minerals industry has had important positive implications for regional economies, such as direct employment and the establishment of supporting industries such as geophysical analysis and exploration services. It has also had positive implications for power generation, steel production, ports, shipping and transport services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining and basic metal products industries are major investors in the Australian economy. In 1993-94 capital investments&mdash;including plant, equipment and buildings&mdash;totalled $7.1 billion, which represents 26 per cent of capital investment by all industries. These statistics serve to graphically highlight the mining industry's significant contribution to the national economy and bring into sharp focus the need for government to pursue policies which protect the viability and future of Australia's largest exporter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Finally, may I say how important it is to maintain the diesel fuel rebate to the farming and mining sectors and to the fishing and forestry industries to enable them to continue to produce export earnings for Australia. Certainly this bill recognises the importance of one area of mining or quarrying, but iron ically this area is linked to the farming industry. I certainly support the maintenance of the diesel fuel rebate for limestone quarrying operations.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Capricornia)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.38 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The persistent speculation that the federal government will or will not discontinue or heavily modify the current diesel fuel rebate system needs to be addressed immediately, owing to the continuing uncertainty in the mining, primary producing and fishing sectors. I therefore take great pleasure in having the opportunity to talk on the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) as this topic will have strong ramifications to Australia's economic wellbeing, pending the final outcomes. Therefore, as the legislation passes through the Senate, I urge the Senate to take on board the proposed changes to the legislation and to expedite them as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any piece of legislation has the ability to be refined. It is considered that this government can improve the existing fuel rebate system through the extensive consultation that has been undertaken in an effort to provide a better system. The wealth producing sector of Australia is sick and tired of successive governments whittling away their hard won gains in productivity. It is virtually impossible to win a game where the goalposts and the rules consistently change against them. We cannot afford for that to happen. The mining sector and the farming sector provide the largest percentage of our export earnings. Reduce this and we will continue to have a serious economic problem in this country for a long time to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Senate refrains from its continual obstructive debate and works with this government to implement its amendments and changes that will refine the diesel fuel rebate system, I am confident that mining and primary producing people will be able to implement their future plans. With this country's currency rising daily and primary produce and commodity prices taking a downward turn, most of these businesses are struggling to make a decent profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If those businesses do manage to survive under the current poor economic and climatic <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2145"> conditions, they certainly will be restructuring their commitment and their work force, which will have disastrous consequences on this government's intention to get the nation back working and to reduce the deficit. The crippling of primary production by increased costs is not the way to rein in the country's foreign debt problem. Rural people are looking for assurances that this federal government values primary industry and its role in the future prosperity of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a considerable number of mining industries operating in my electorate of Capricornia covering such sectors as coal, gold, minerals and gemstones. Many cost factors are associated with these industries&mdash;transport and electricity generation being two of the major contributors to these costs. Besides the added cost to local business, the flow-on effects of any loss of business will seriously affect all Central Queensland regions. Unemployment will increase to tragic proportions as in all these regions there is no alternative employment opportunities. It will result in the destruction of whole communities and towns in Central Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of the rebate has risen due to fuel price increases&mdash;not usage. Diesel fuel excise rates have increased from 10.437c per litre in 1986 to 34.183c per litre today. This is a 228 per cent increase, whereas the number of litres on which mining has been paid has grown less than 100 per cent over the same period. Just in case the House has forgotten, the most recent review of diesel excise rebate policy by the Industry Commission recommended that the rebate for mining activities be extended&mdash;not reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the mining issue, I recently travelled to meet with concerned constituents at gem fields on the border of my electorate adjoining the division of Maranoa. They provided extensive evidence to prove that the loss of the diesel fuel rebate in their industry would mean an end to an industry that not only employs many people but also promotes tourism and brings great wealth to the gem fields and the Emerald community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farming industry in my electorate has been suffering from drought for years. It has also suffered from high interest rates, falling <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prices and a decline in demand. This week it was declared that the Fairbairn Dam, located just south of Emerald, will cease as at 30 June the allocation of water to primary producers. This specifically extends to the grain and cotton industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the sale of a bale of cotton is $150 less than the cost of production. This is a clear indication that these primary producers are struggling, and the loss of the diesel fuel rebate will send these people to the wall and effectively destroy an industry that has already been marred by drought. To them, a reduction in the diesel fuel rebate will be like reducing the Australian dollar to 50c. It will be a knife in their back&mdash;just when they thought the worst was over after they elected a coalition government and got rid of the free wheeling, free spending unaccountable Keating government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any attempt to remove the diesel fuel rebate scheme will be counterproductive for the economy and will have a profound effect on the community standard of living and quality of life. Removal of the rebate will be totally opposite to the government's stated objectives of value adding for export and making Australia's industry more competitive and efficient on the world stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The points I have made here tonight in relation to the diesel fuel rebate scheme are imperative to Australia's economic future and development. I do not intend to build a speech that provides extensive waffle for I think I have made my point on this topic already.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today is a historic occasion in the history of Australian industrial relations. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill put forward by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and strongly supported by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) represents a shift from the 100&hyphen;year&hyphen;old culture of centralised wage fixing and addresses Australia's arthritic labour market structures, dominated by unions and arbitral tribunals resembling the craft based guilds of medieval England.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill shifts the focus away from the adversarial culture of `them and us' which has dominated Australian industrial relations. That culture had its manifestation in the quasi&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2147">judicial form of the Arbitration Commission and the principles laid down by Justice Higgins in the infamous Harvester judgment of 1907. It was 200 years ago that Adam Smith, in his seminal work, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Wealth of Nations</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The demand for those who live by wages naturally increases with the increase of national wealth, and cannot possibly increase without it.</PARA>
<PARA>At the turn of the century, Australians were on average the richest people in the world, but today our GDP per capita ranks 15th in the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have been overtaken by the first of the Asian tigers, Hong Kong and Singapore, on the international league table of average income. Again, the words of Adam Smith ring true for Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Though the wealth of the country should be very great, yet if it has been long stationary, we must not expect to find the wages of labour very high in it.</PARA>
<PARA>A recent article by Mr Michael Warby in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  reported how one prominent Hong Kong tailor has asserted that he can now get his suits cheaper in Brisbane than he can in Hong Kong, once regarded as the sweat shop of Asia. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For almost 100 years, Australians have had a vast edifice of arbitration&mdash;a regulatory system of Byzantine complexity&mdash;to protect us from exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Meanwhile, Hong Kong operates with no minimum wage or unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result? Australia has 9% unemployment. Hong Kong is now confronting the scandal of 3% unemployment and Hong Kong is contracting work out to cheap Australian labour.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the backdrop to the debate on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. For a century, Australia's industrial relations system ignored the words of Adam Smith, denying the reality of free market forces and pretending that high incomes could be maintained by judicial decree rather than productivity and economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The focus of this bill is on altering the culture of workplace relations so that decisions are made increasingly at the enterprise level and due regard is given to productivity and workplace realities. While the traditional <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> centralist award system is based on dispute between an employee and an employer, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Bill emphasises cooperation and agreement for mutual benefit. This is a cultural shift which will ensure Australia's place in the competitive international economy of the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This sea change had its early beginnings in the backbench committee of the coalition opposition in 1986. In this context, I place on the public record the great contribution to the public debate by the honourable member for Barker, the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan). Events like the Dollar Sweets case, Robe River and the landmark Mudginberri dispute drew attention to the reality that unbridled union power was alive and well. But there were other positive forces, such as the member for Barker and his ally Paul Houlihan, Peter Costello, the Treasurer, and Charles Copeman, who sought to find a better industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The backbench industrial relations committee, which I had the honour of chairing during these early debates, developed the early proposals for enterprise bargaining. For his part, John Howard lent his formidable talents to arguing and supporting the case. He has remained one of the strongest advocates for change to the system on the Australian political scene. The ongoing debate was ably assisted by the former shadow minister, the Hon. Neil Brown QC, and the current Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). In the end, the Hawke government changed its longstanding opposition to enterprise bargaining, albeit a little too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I feel personally very proud that those strenuous and hard&hyphen;fought debates have finally found a more complete manifestation. Big business leaders said it could never be done, living as they did in a cosy system where all workers were paid according to the award no matter what their attitudes, skills and capacities. Today, in 1996, the system of industrial relations remains highly centralised, heavily regulated and dominated by the `Industrial relations club', first talked about by Gerard Henderson in his 1983 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant </EMPHASIS>article. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2148">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Awards remain complex and detailed, leaving little scope for enterprises to agree on specific terms and conditions of employment. Enterprise agreements must be approved by the IRC and can be rejected even when a consensus of employees supports the agreement. Union structure is tightly regulated, giving large established unions monopoly rights over workers due to the `conveniently belong' rule. The monopoly position of the union movement is entrenched by preference clauses, which are still prescribed in several awards, giving union members preference in employment over non&hyphen;union workers. Laws on unfair dismissals are prescriptive and technical, providing a strong disincentive to small employers to hire new staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This centralised and regulated industrial relations system had its advent in the 1907 Harvester judgment delivered by Justice Higgins. It was then that the foundations were laid for the system which has handicapped Australia's economic development for the last 100 years. The background to this case was that a tariff of &pound;12 was charged on imported harvesters and a tax of &pound;6 was charged on Australian produced harvesters. Manufacturers were exempt from the tax if they paid wages which were deemed to be fair and reasonable. So Justice Higgins set about to determine whether the wages paid by one particular manufacturer were fair and reasonable, thus ascertaining whether the company was eligible to have an exemption from the excise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than relying on the company's capacity to pay or on the productivity of individual employees, Higgins decided wage levels could be determined only on the basis of a crude estimate of the cost of living. There was no suggestion that the price of labour be determined by the realities of supply and demand, as in the case of groceries at the supermarket. Instead, His Honour took expert testimony from a number of housewives on the cost of a number of goods. In the compilation of those goods, His Honour took into account a number of items that were considered to make up the basic wage for the case. In compiling that list, the items added up to the cost of living that was taken <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into account in drafting his famous Harvester proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having the Harvester proposal and the tariff regime surrounding that proposal in place meant that from 1907 to 1996 Australian industrial relations were dominated by the feature of a non-market arrangement. So industrial tribunals came down with awards and had arrangements that had no relationship to the marketplace. These awards were prescriptive and had no relationship to the way in which Australians worked in the factories and on the farms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the manufacturers were able to live in this protected environment, which meant that the exporters, the farmers and the miners had to compete on the world markets. On the one hand, the farmers were receiving the price for their wool and their grain as the world market might decree. However, other people in the manufacturing area were receiving a price that was largely determined by the cost of labour which, in turn, was arbitrated by the Arbitration Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process went on and on and on. People in Australia considered that this was the normal order of things, so much so that, until there was a challenge to the award system by the likes of the Minister for Industrial Relations, who is at the table, Ian McLachlan and others, people in Australia thought that there could never be a change to the position that the Harvester award had created&mdash;a basic wage for all Australians. From that point on, the changes would take a long while to be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So big manufacturing companies maintained this ancient system that had no relativity to the genuine marketplace of the productivity and capacities of individual Australians. This wage fixing system developed in those early years by the Harvester judgment led to the H.R. Nicholls Society being formed in the early 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That society developed a questioning attitude to the current arrangements of Australian industrial relations. The activities of that group challenged the status quo of industrial relations in Australia. I pay tribute to that group. It developed some arguments that were followed up in this parliament and argued in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2149"> many forums around Australia. I pay tribute to the minister at the table for having reached this landmark decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also pay tribute to the arguments put by a former member of this House, the Hon. Bert Kelly. He had long debates about the tariffs that were related to the Harvester judgment and about the fact that certain industries enjoyed this protection whereas their workers were protected at a level of wages and salaries that had no relativity to the outside marketplace, let alone the Australian marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key objectives of the bill are to promote cooperation in the workplace and a world competitive industrial relations system. Awards increasingly will be determined in the enterprise rather than the hearing rooms of the industrial relations system in a quasi&hyphen;legal manner. Awards will be simplified. The new awards will deal only with core matters&mdash;sick leave, annual leave and jury leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other terms and conditions will be determined at the workplace. The new legislation before the House will require management and employees to discuss and work out their own work conditions rather than rely on comprehensive awards to dictate every last detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a new stream of non&hyphen;union enterprise bargaining, the very thing that we on this side of the parliament say will put thrust back into enterprise agreements. Workplace agreements will be introduced and made possible without unwanted union interference, and they can proceed without the approval of the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As all members of this House would know, Labor's enterprise flexibility agreements, supposedly designed for the non&hyphen;union sector, required union involvement and approval by the commission, even when management and work force had agreed on various working conditions. What a strange set of arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A union with no members at the workplace could argue against an agreement in the Industrial Relations Commission, and the commission could then reject it. We on this side of the House find it amazing that you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could have a union member with no connection to the workplace arguing against a set of conditions. The Tweed Heads case regarding sick leave was a classic example of the unions and the Industrial Relations Commission thwarting a legitimate enterprise agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under coalition policy, approval by the commission will not be required, nor will unions have a guaranteed role. Safeguards will ensure that workers are not exploited and include a guarantee that take&hyphen;home pay will not decrease relative to the award. Agreements will be lodged with employee advocates&mdash;funded by the government, I might add&mdash;who will act for the employees to ensure that they are not being disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to freedom of association. A key element of the bill before the House is that workers will be able to choose whether they join a union. No more the old story of no ticket&hyphen;no start on building sites, which was strictly enforced by the militant BLF in days gone by. Preference clauses, giving union members preference in employment in several industries, will be removed from awards altogether. That in itself will be a major breakthrough for a number of industries where no ticket&hyphen;no start has been very much the order of the day and no legal process has been able to overcome that long tradition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Preference clauses are one of the primary reasons for several industries being characterised as closed shops here in Australia and also in the UK. The coal industry, the oil industry and the waterfront are all characterised by compulsory membership of unions. All members of this House would be very aware of the impact monopoly coverage has had on those industries. It has ensured that they have had more than their fair share of strikes and industrial disputes. The current battle involving the CFMEU and Australian coal ports is a case in point, illustrating the way the union controls the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No longer will what was once the only remaining issue&mdash;which union will be granted coverage of a particular workplace&mdash;be made on high in the Industrial Relations Commission. No longer will the commission or the union dominate over the freedom of choice <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2150"> that workers and management will have under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be no more union monopolies. The `conveniently belong' rule will be done away with, with new unions being able to challenge the position of established unions. Unions will be treated as what they are&mdash;service providers which should be exposed to the same competition as anyone else in the industry. No longer will the unions enjoy what union leaders have come to expect as a right&mdash;a total monopoly position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Union bosses will have to serve their members rather than using the union movement as a stepping-stone to a political future with the ALP. Most members opposite have used the union movement and the industrial relations system to further their political careers, as the minister at the table would fully understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a return to the secondary boycott provisions. Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act will return to provide employers with injunctive relief against unions which engage in secondary boycotts. The Prime Minister, in 1974, was instrumental in bringing this measure in. It will provide protection for employers who find themselves the victims of industrial disputes which have nothing to do with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers will be better equipped to deal with the storemen and packers and transport workers union whose members have often refused to deliver goods on the basis of a totally unrelated dispute. That may seem rather technical to those outside this House. But anyone who has been involved in a secondary boycott dispute where small business was subjected to this sort of treatment will fully understand the impact of this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfair dismissal laws will be amended to provide a fair go to employers and employees all round. It seems to me that an unfair dismissal action is about $7,000 a pop at the moment. If you have a problem with an unfair dismissal, as the minister at the table would know, it is hardly worth going through the process because it will cost you a couple of thousand dollars in legal costs and another $5,000 when judgment is awarded against <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you, so much so that 23,000 applications for unfair dismissal have been filed but only 3,500 have been before the Industrial Relations Commission. With the new bill we will get rid of the unfair dismissal laws, and I think there will be a great sigh of relief around Australia that this terrible provision full of legality has been removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude by making the observation that at long last industrial relations will be related to the marketplace; they will be related to the ability of employees to work hard, to improve their capacities and their skills and be rewarded for merit and effort. No longer will Australian employees be regarded as one with no recognition for performance and no recognition that they might have different skills from their fellow workmates in the workplace. They will be able to be compensated for improving, for doing a better job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, with this new bill, productivity and efficiency in Australia will be improved immensely. We will have a highly competitive, export driven economy where workers know that the prosperity of Australia will depend on their efforts&mdash;and not on the decisions of the Arbitration Commission or the history of Justice Higgins, who brought down the famous Harvester judgment. This is a historic day in the Australian parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House tonight a serious issue of injustice which has been suffered by two constituents of mine who were involved in the lease of a hotel. Patricia Lorraine Williams and Ernest Arthur Wilson were made bankrupt by virtue of sequestration orders made on 17 February 1986 and 23 April 1986 respectively in the Federal Court of Australia in proceedings No. 114 of 1986, No. NB 426 of 1986. They were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2151"> discharged from their bankruptcy three years later. The Official Trustee in Bankruptcy was appointed their trustee and has administered and continues to administer their bankrupt estate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 10 August 1988 a company, Welona Pty Ltd, lodged a proof of debt with the Official Trustee which resulted in a hearing arising out of the proof of debt taking place in the Federal Court before Sweeney J. on 6, 7 and 8 October 1992. In these proceedings, evidence was given by a director of Welona Pty Ltd, Ronald William Charles Bowen, in relation to certain photographs taken of the Gardeners Inn Hotel around which the dispute revolved. Welona Pty Ltd was the registered proprietor of the hotel. This led to photographs being identified by a witness, Mr Nigel Richmond Bell, and tendered as a result of direct evidence given by Mr Bowen, being exhibits 6, 7 and 8 in the proceedings. These photographs were all said to have been taken on 29 January 1985. An investigation has been carried out by Mr Wilson, Ms Williams and Mr John Whitfield as to the accuracy of the evidence given by Mr Bowen as to the date on which these photographs were taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears that a substantial number of the photographs could not have been taken on that date. There is one photograph, the subject of evidence given by Mr Bowen, that establishes that the evidence given in these proceedings was untrue. This is evidence given on page 103 of the transcript as to exhibit 8. In short, the evidence is that the photograph was taken in January 1985. From other evidence in the proceedings, the date in January is said to be 29 January 1985. The evidence is that a newspaper bearing the same date as the photographs was placed in the photographs to prove the date on which the photograph was taken, being January 1985. The date of the newspaper in the photograph is 14 March 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other photographs tendered in evidence which were definitely taken at a time other than 29 January 1985. Some of these photographs bear dates in 1983 and it is believed they were taken by Ronald Benson, who is deceased. Other photographs were taken later in 1985 after the hotel had been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> renovated. This can be established by independent evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other disturbing aspect of this case relating to the photographs is that in 1986 Wilson gave certain photographs which he says were taken earlier in the lease to James Thomas Garrett, an officer of the Insolvency and Trustee Service of Australia. On his own admission, Mr Garrett has sworn affidavits that these photographs were lost. However, some of these photographs formed part of exhibits 6 and 7 in the proceedings and more than likely exhibit 8, which was supposed to hold one photograph, and were eventually located by the writer with exhibits in the file of Wilson and Williams in the Federal Court, although said to have been missing at the time of the hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no explanation from Mr Garrett as to how this occurred and subsequently it is the contention of Wilson and Williams that the photographs were misused. The Official Trustee in Bankruptcy has been most reluctant to allow access to their files to investigate what occurred. They have had an internal investigation without allowing access to files and without interviewing Wilson and Williams. Their only conclusion is that the photographs were mislaid and this would result in updating internal procedures in the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wilson and Williams are requesting investigation into this matter as to the evidence given by Mr Bowen as to the photographs and, in particular, the photograph containing the newspaper and the obvious discrepancy. My constituents are further requesting investigation into the matter of the photographs leaving the possession of the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy and who had access to such photographs. The possible misuse of these photographs is of great concern to my constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to ask the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) to at least meet with the barrister representing Mr Wilson and Ms Williams, as there is a grave allegation of misuse of the positions they hold and the fact that perjury is involved. I believe the Attorney&hyphen;General should at least meet with the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2152"> barrister to clear up what seems to be a terrible injustice to my constituents.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

The composition of this committee is an absolute farce. This committee has excluded the area in which Sydney airport is actually located. The local government area of Botany, the state seat of Heffron and the federal seat of Kingsford&hyphen;Smith will have no input into the future direction and operations of Sydney airport. Also, the federal seat of Sydney has no representation. The state seat of Marrickville, over which most of the planes fly, has also been excluded from representation, as have the state seats of Drummoyne and Ashfield.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the local government area of Rockdale, the area most affected by the east&hyphen;west runway to the west of that runway, is excluded from representation. Leichhardt Council, South Sydney Council, Drummoyne and Ashfield councils to the north of the airport have also been excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the community representation this farce is exposed. You have five community representatives. There are three from the North Shore of Sydney. Bennelong is singled out to get a representative. No other electorate, no other local government area, has been singled out to get a community representative but Bennelong once again gets special treatment. The Upper North Shore also gets special treatment. The Liberal front group, the Sydney Airport Forum, also gets representation. There is one representative from Kurnell, and the area around the airport most affected&mdash;the inner west, the area within 10 kilometres of which you have to fly before you hit any other area&mdash;has just one representative. This shows the North Shore bias in this committee; it is an absolute rort.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very angry that when the issue of community consultation was raised with the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) he said, `Oh, but John Howard and I went to a public meeting in Hunters Hill.' Frankly, it is just not good enough for the Minister for Transport and Regional Development to refuse to have any consultation with the residents most affected around areas such as Marrickville, Leichhardt, Sydenham and Rockdale and to ignore those areas and say that representation is solely on the basis of the people in Hunters Hill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many grave and sad issues are raised in this House. In the short time available to me I would like to raise one tonight: the increasing break-up of families in this country and the inequities that occur when that happens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last weekend I was placed in a very difficult position. I felt totally inadequate and did not quite know what to do. This is the story: a father, and it could equally have been a mother, had an access order to see his children. He went around to where they were and was denied access. He had a Family Court order and was permitted to see his children between the hours of one o'clock and five o'clock on that Saturday afternoon. He was denied access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did he do about it? He was so upset that he went to see the Queensland police. Their response was, `I'm sorry, we have no jurisdiction in the matter.' He said, `I have this Family Court order. I am entitled to have access to my children.' They said, `Sorry.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the Monday he went to see the Australian Federal Police to see what they might be able to do about it. Same story: `We can't do anything about it unless it is written on the court order.' I have now found out that the only recourse this father has is to go back to the Family Court. And what happens there the majority of times? It may take up to six months to get a hearing in the Family Court. Once he gets there, what happens? Whoever is in the Family Court probably rules that the other party is in contempt, but there is virtually no penalty. Why put on a penalty? The other party probably cannot afford a penalty anyway. You go around in a circle and six months later the fellow still has not had access to his children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is wrong. That is something that the people, the courts and the law&hyphen;makers of this nation should be addressing some attention to. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Parents absolutely should have right of access to their children. I felt very inadequate last weekend when I saw that occur.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to bring to the notice of the parliament this evening the activities of a group called Central Coast&hyphen;Newcastle Breast Implant Support Groups. The group is headed up by my constituents Kim and Leah Boyd. Kim is the husband, and Leah is in very poor health and her health is worsening. There are tragic stories when one deals with constituents who have had to suffer the after&hyphen;effects of breast implants and when one sees the litigation that has been going on in the United States. The preferential treatment that seems to have been given to American women who have had these implants compared with the great difficulties placed in the way of Australian women who have had exactly the same procedures is to be condemned both in this parliament and from every rostrum when we have the opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two volunteers&mdash;particularly Kim, the husband&mdash;head up this support group, and they work for the Women's Breast Implant Resource Service. They are people who are giving of their time and their feelings and who have given the little bit of resource they had. They are committed to helping and supporting women who have had or are considering the implantation of breast implants. They are committed to giving voice to women's experiences. They give the evidence of experts the same weight as they do the personal experiences of `uneducated women', as they are called: in other words, women who do not have the expertise or the resources available to express themselves as eloquently as do members of the medical fraternity and the legal people that they employ on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key to the people in this group is that they learn from each other and from health <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2154"> care providers, and the health care providers learn from women. It is a situation where women learn from women and share experiences. Their network is completely unfunded. These are people in poor circumstances who are going through a terrible stage in their life&mdash;if they have survived. They are unpaid volunteers, all of whom have had personal breast implant experience. They devote their own time and personal resources to helping other women in any situation that they may find themselves in. Their help may involve providing advice or a sympathetic ear or simply a shoulder to lean on. It may involve sharing what is so often the loneliness of this experience and also, in many ways, the stigmatising of the experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst some members of the community there is an attitude that, if somebody has had this procedure, that is something they have had done of their own choice. I do not believe that these women really get either the wholehearted community support that they ought to get or the recognition they ought to get in their absolute plight. This network is committed to ensuring that women with breast implants receive appropriate and affordable medical treatment and that the same women receive respect, compassion and full disclosure of medical information from health care providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This network is dedicated to ensuring that country and regional women are not disadvantaged in accessing appropriate health services because of distance barriers or communication barriers, in whatever form. They are dedicated to ensuring that health policies and programs are devised to accurately meet their very specific health care needs and the resultant emotional trauma. They are dedicated to ensuring that policies and programs redress the problems that these women are suffering due to the insertion of inadequately tested devices into their bodies without truly informed consent. They want to ensure that women are given enough accurate information now to make a truly informed choice about their own bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is only the beginning. I hope in the adjournment debates over the next few days to have the opportunity to give a further explanation of the work that is going on and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> try to seek the support of other members of this parliament and other members of the community in recognising the difficulty and the suffering of so many Australian women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The group strives to influence public health policy so women are protected from hazardous or inadequately tested medical devices. They want to gather and share information from medical and many other sources and, most importantly, from other women with similar experiences. They want to communicate regularly with health policy makers in government to keep women up to date with the latest developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few moments that remain, I simply want to say that I commend Kim Boyd for his efforts and I admire the courage of his wife, Leah, in the plight in which they find themselves. Kim is now devoting himself full&hyphen;time, using the few resources available to them, to trying to make life more comfortable for Leah. In the sharing of their own agony, they are trying to ensure that other women and families who are in a similar situation get the kind of help that they have not been able to get to date.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the adjournment debate this evening to congratulate and encourage the Victorian Premier, Mr Jeff Kennett. I do so for the leadership he has shown in getting the drug debate up and running in Victoria. I think those who have been following the drug debate in Victoria could be forgiven for thinking that it was all about the legalisation of cannabis. In fact, Premier Kennett's Drug Advisory Council, under the chairmanship of the conservative medical academic David Penington, was the response to a series of heroin related deaths and, finally, an incident that was probably too confronting for any political leader and indeed the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In February, Melbourne's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> ran a front page photograph of three kids, 12, 14 and 15 years of age, injecting heroin in a school toilet. They shared a single needle. The sickening image was captured by a surveillance camera secretly placed by the headmaster of the school. I think that issue in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2155"> itself was unfortunately not the subject of public debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why then did Professor Penington's council head off in the direction of cannabis and recommend liberalisation of cannabis laws to boot? The problem is that in the first instance tobacco&mdash;and young people from 12 to 17 years smoke 6&half; million cigarettes every week&mdash;is the gateway drug that greatly increases the likelihood of young people trying marijuana when it is offered to them. In fact, those who smoke cigarettes are 28 times more likely to say yes to cannabis. Those who sell cannabis invariably have other drugs to peddle, thereby introducing their frequently innocent buyers to a variety of life&hyphen;sapping products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question I ask&mdash;and one I think the Australian community needs to ask&mdash;is: are we really listening to young people? I think if we were we would find that they will tell us that drug education is frequently seen as irrelevant, hypocritical and lacking credibility. In the context of the debate which has just occurred in Victoria, and not often enough in other parts of Australia, people ought to remember that the national drug strategy has established that in one year over half of teenagers between the ages of 14 and 19 years will be offered cannabis. A quarter of them would have smoked it in the last 12 months and 40 per cent would have smoked it at some time in the past. The cannabis trade in Australia is estimated to be worth some $2 billion. In the state of Queensland, for example, the CJC estimates its total value at $652 million a year, second only to sugar as a cash crop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian government is to be given credit for now putting $25 million into drug education programs in Victoria. Even though we could go a lot further, compared with the national commitment of some $37 million for drug education, it is a substantial move in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what members of this chamber and, I think, Australians generally need to remember is that what we are doing with heroin, speed, cannabis and ecstasy is clearly not working. The legalisation of these drugs is not the answer either and those who think it is need <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> look no further than tobacco for evidence of failure. However, drug users and addicts in particular should be treated as the pitiable people that they are and much less like criminals. Those who peddle drug misery deserve much more attention from the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to direct our energies to addressing those conditions which breed a disillusionment with the future and a sense of hopelessness about the present. If ever an issue begged leadership&mdash;glimpses of which we have seen from the Victorian Premier, Mr Jeff Kennett&mdash;it is this one. The Victorian Premier made the Victorian parliament available for discussion of this issue, about which all Australian parents in particular are concerned. It is a model that could be applied to this parliament not only for drug debates but, indeed, for other pressing issues of concern.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to briefly address the issue of radiation safety. When the subject of radiation is mentioned, most people's first thoughts would be of nuclear fall&hyphen;out. In Australia, concern about nuclear fall&hyphen;out tends to focus on the after&hyphen;effects of the French nuclear tests. Much more potent radiation is present at Maralinga&mdash;the site of British atomic bomb tests in the immediate postwar years. After some years of negotiation, the British government have agreed to contribute to the clean&hyphen;up of plutonium contamination at Maralinga to make the area safer for human habitation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When nuclear energy is used as a fuel, as we saw at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, there is always the danger of an accident. While there are no nuclear power stations in this country, Australian ports are sometimes visited by nuclear&hyphen;powered ships and we do have a reactor at Lucas Heights, so the possibility of some kind of emergency or accident is not totally remote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2156"> In our daily lives we have much greater contact with deadly radiation than many people may be aware. X&hyphen;rays are widely used in medicine, but their use is still a fairly imprecise science. More knowledge is needed of the effect of dosages&mdash;and about equip ment that provides accurate measurement of doses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday's papers carried a report that as many as 271 Australians die every year as the direct result of underestimation of the cancer risks of X&hyphen;rays. The Royal Australasian College of Radiologists says that there is a potential for harm in even small doses of X&hyphen;rays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A more intangible but strongly felt concern relates to possible harmful radiation from high tension power lines and from mobile phones, both of which are receiving increasing publicity. But what may not be generally appreciated is that Australia is a world leader in the detection of levels of harmful radiation and also in the development of techniques to minimise their danger. This is thanks to the work carried out over many years by the Australian Radiation Laboratory, located in my electorate of Jagajaga in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Radiation Laboratory has monitoring stations located around the country that are able to instantly detect any radiation that may result from nuclear testing. The effectiveness of the Maralinga clean&hyphen;up is also guaranteed by ARL field&hyphen;monitoring. If any nuclear incident were to occur in Australia, it would be the emergency preparedness team from ARL that guided emergency service response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The laboratory is also engaged in cutting edge research that will enable radiologists to exactly determine the amount of radiation that is given to patients, thus making this essential medical treatment that much safer as well as providing a potentially very internationally&hyphen;marketable body of expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When parents go to buy sunscreens and UV resistant clothes for themselves and their children, they can do so confident in knowing exactly how protective the garments and creams will be, thanks to the testing and standard setting carried out at the laboratory. This work has lately extended to testing and monitoring the exact effects of radiation from power lines and mobile phones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The story, of course, does not have a happy ending. This government, as part of its budget cuts, is proposing to subject the Australian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Radiation Laboratory to staffing cuts of close to 20 per cent. This is an outrageous and unnecessary action and Australia stands to lose expertise and knowledge built up over decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I attended a meeting of the staff at the laboratory. These are eminent scientists, leaders in their fields, who are completely bewildered at this government's actions to cuts that will, of course, force redundancies. Totally out of character, they intend to take strike action on Thursday if some sanity does not return to this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fear that with ARL we are seeing what will be one of many scenes of unnecessary loss and suffering this government will cause as a result of the wrong&hyphen;headed economic policies. I hope it will change for ARL and radiation health safety.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<SPEECH PAGE="2156" TIME="10.36 p.m." SPEAKER="Billson, Bruce, MP" NAMEID="1K6" ELECTORATE="Dunkley" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K6">Mr BILLSON</NAME>
<ELECTORATE> (Dunkley)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.36 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, may I commend you on your razor sharp vision and speak for a few moments on one of Australia's most respected business organisations: Australia Post. Nationally, Australia Post operates 4,300 outlets and handles about 100 million bill&hyphen;paying transactions each year, growing by 34 per cent last year, and 3.8 billion mail articles are delivered annually to 7.7 million different points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994-95 Australia Post revenue grew by over eight per cent to $2.781 billion. It made a record profit of $331 million before tax, paid $106 million in tax and returned $120 million to the federal government by way of dividend. It also invested $270 million in modernising its retail network and further enhanced its computerised technology, now of such a high standard that other financial institutions such as American Express are clamouring to sign retail and back office agreements with Australia Post to use initiatives such as giropost. Australia Post is anticipating similar results for this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia Post has changed. Its retail shops are a complete redesign of the traditional post office. Its staff are increasingly productive and, as I indicated, Australia Post is ahead of the field in technology. At local post offices <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2157"> such as Frankston, in Dunkley, staff now start work earlier to have most of the mail in private boxes by 8.30 a.m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, despite these substantial improvements, Australia Post continues to engage the respected corporate design consultants Emery Vincent Associates in what will overall be a multimillion dollar assignment to add the word `post' to Australia Post's corporate identity. Almost two weeks after the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> featured a story on 6 June in which Australia Post said that `no approval has been given for such change; it is still very early days' and talked of the current logo's icon status, Australia Post is yet to clarify the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia Post claims that it has been slowly introducing this `post' logo since 1991, that it is merely an evolutionary change and that the recognisable P-shaped logo has been retained in all cases. The organisation's stationery already bears the capitalised word `post' vertically along the right-hand margin and the former Australia Post logo still appears at the top of the letterhead. It is sort of an each&hyphen;way bet. So what is the point?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the corporate design world these sorts of contracts are prized, but opinions differ. One Melbourne based consultant to whom my staff spoke suggested that Australia Post might consider repositioning itself in the marketplace. That might involve changing its logo. But, on its own, changing a logo will not amount to much. A major Sydney design consultancy said that Australia Post's current logo is good and does not jump out as being particularly dated. Ken Cato, Chairman of Cato Design Inc., in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 3 October 1989, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Design budgets are massive and many corporates don't understand what is being done . . . they end up spending too much and don't know it&mdash;the cost to pull down the old is often as much as the budget for the new identity.</PARA>
<PARA>Why Australia Post wants to delete the word `Australia' and reduce its relative significance is difficult to comprehend. Dropping or reducing the relative prominence of the word `Australia' from its well-designed logo goes against the trend. When Ansett last had a logo change they became Ansett Australia. Qantas retained the `Australian airline' motto when <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it merged with Australian Airlines. By way of example, replacing just one moulded sign at each of the 1,500 major properties Australia Post operates would cost Australia Post $1.5 million, a further $300,000 for the 3,100 licensed post offices and community mail agencies, plus tens of thousands of dollars for internal signage, trucks and delivery vehicles requiring repainting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will our international mail go overseas with little or no marking of its country of origin? I thought we would be proudly pushing Australia's good name into the world economies at every opportunity. Australia Post does not need a new logo. The word `post' is in itself meaningless. According to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Oxford English Dictionary</EMPHASIS>, `post' has at least 87 different meanings and several hundred if the many words meaning `after' are included. Does Australia Post plan to market receiving a cheque in the mail as a new age post-post experience? The best explanation I have been able to obtain is that this `drip feed' change is just slowly being introduced&mdash;to what end, I am not sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise these issues because, despite these funds being expended, the plans to resite the Frankston delivery centre are moving very slowly and plans for its future are still uncertain. The majority of local traders, customers of the centre and the council strongly favour a replacement facility located close to Playne Street. I encourage Australia Post to meet with the Frankston City Council to see whether a new delivery centre could be located on the former Frankston police station site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Committing available resources to continuous improvement in service, new products and service outlets that are responsive to customers' needs and the sensible use of cost-conscious technologies and premises are the way to go&mdash;not a needless and half&hyphen;hearted corporate image `makeover'. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<ELECTORATE> (Perth)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.41 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to speak on a matter which is very important to my electorate, particularly to the regional centre of Midland and the north-east portions of my electorate, and that is local community efforts <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2158"> to establish a university campus at Midland. The provision of a university campus at Midland would provide Midland, the north-east corridor and the Shire of Swan with a massive economic and social boost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preferred local site for a Midland university is the former site of the Midland Westrail railway workshops. In the run&hyphen;up to the 1993 state election, the current state coalition government promised the retention of the workshops and its expansion into a modern engineering site. Unfortunately, less than three months after that government's election at the state level, they broke that promise and closed the workshops. Since that time there has been a strong local push to establish a university on the site. This has been led by the Shire of Swan and supported by local members of parliament, state and federal, and the community generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last couple of years we have seen very many of the necessary building blocks put in place. During the last 12 months, the previous federal Labor government&mdash;in particular, the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean&mdash;ensured that funding was made available for 750 extra places for tertiary students in Western Australia over the next three to four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, very many efforts were made at the local level urging the state government to adopt Midland campus as a priority for the state so far as capital development program funds were concerned. Members may be aware that Commonwealth capital development funds are accorded priority at the state level and that that guides the Commonwealth in its determination of grants from the capital development pool. More recently, we have seen in the last week or so Edith Cowan University initiate and launch university classes to be conducted by Edith Cowan University in conjunction with Midland TAFE at the site of the old Midland Westrail workshops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these building blocks and the prospect of a full university campus in Midland are now at risk. That has arisen from two matters. Firstly, at the federal level we have the mooted education cuts&mdash;as high as $600 million&mdash;and a failure on the part of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> current federal government to guarantee the funding for the 750 extra places required in Western Australia&mdash;not just for a Midland campus but to cater for the growth which is occurring in my own state. Secondly, at the state level the state government has refused to give any indication as to its order of priority for capital development funds. A number of competing bids are in at the moment, including those for a Mandurah/Rockingham campus of Murdoch University and a Kalgoorlie campus of Curtin University. But there has been a deafening silence on the part of the state government as to its intentions in respect of the priority for capital development funds for a Midland university campus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Requests for guarantees in respect of funding for the extra places and priority for capital development grants at the state level have fallen on deaf ears. Indeed, the federal member for Pearce, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), has been deafening in her silence in response to requests from me to guarantee funding. As well, her state colleague the member for Swan Hills, Mrs June van de Klashorst, has also been deafening by her silence in her failure or refusal to give any indication as to her government's priorities in the allocation of capital development grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prospect of a boost to Midland and the prospect of the provision of a university campus for the north&hyphen;east corridor of the metropolitan area are all now at risk and in jeopardy. The prospects are bleak as a consequence of mooted cuts at the federal level and the failure of the state government to accord priority for a Midland campus. What is required is the full commitment at the state and federal level to ensure a university is committed to a growth area of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Midland is very well situated for a campus of a university, sitting as it does at the end of the metropolitan railway line, with good transport links in addition to railway. It is now the centre of a growing hub, particularly with developments in Stratton and Ellenbrook. That area of the north&hyphen;east corridor has major growth prospects over the next decade. I again call upon the state and federal governments to accord priority to the provision of a Midland campus of a university.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently, in the adjournment debate, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) launched a broadside against my illustrious ancestor, the Hon. T.D. Mutch, a former minister in successive Labor governments in New South Wales. The member was responding to a comment in my maiden speech where I said that the ALP ratted on a good man when they deserted Tom Mutch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This simple but true comment attracted a vigorous response from the member for Werriwa, who sought to turn around my allegation and himself alleged that `for no good reason, he'&mdash;Tom Mutch&mdash;`became a Labor rat; he deserted the Labor cause'. My ancestor would probably turn in his grave just a little at this allegation. Having heard it all before from those ignorant of those turbulent days, he would be satisfied with me taking up the challenge of the member for Werriwa to give the House a full account of Tom Mutch's decision to leave the ALP or, rather, the decision of the ALP to leave him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the character of Tom Mutch. I cite no less than Henry Lawson in his defence. In a letter to the electors of Botany, Henry Lawson said of Tom Mutch:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't suppose that Tom could possibly have an opinion but I'd hold the opposite. But he has carried his swag with me and was, and is, the straightest mate I or anyone else ever had, and if he says he's going to do a thing, he's going to do it all right.</PARA>
<PARA>And so, in 1927, when Tom Mutch and other good men in cabinet opposed on principle the notorious conference `red rules' where Lang assumed dictatorial powers, sacked his cabinet and appointed bootlickers, known as the `scabinet', Tom Mutch could do no other than to fight for principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of this upheaval where Tom Mutch was elected leader of the Labor caucus opposed to Lang, a number of good men, including Mutch, lost fraudulent and rigged preselections&mdash;nothing much has changed I can see in the Labor Party&mdash;to the Lang forces, where longstanding league members who were Mutch supporters were struck from the roll of preselectors and new <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> members who were not even on the Botany electoral roll were validated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of sitting members contested the 1927 election. Mutch and Evatt were elected as independent Labor members, vindicating their stand but ensuring automatic expulsion from the ALP. Evatt's readmission and subsequent career in the ALP are ample acknowledgment of the fact that the stand taken by these men was acknowledged as one of principle. To condemn Tom Mutch is to also condemn Doc Evatt. At the time of his decision to stand as independent Labor, Tom Mutch addressed a public rally at the Mascot Town Hall. I quote from an unpublished biography by his niece Grace Doughty:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Party to which I have given a lifetime's loyalty has recently, and I hope temporarily, fallen under the control of a group whose principles and methods are foreign to my conception of the aims and ideals of Australian democracy. I am an uncompromising opponent of communism, and because of that, I am being fought with unparalleled unscrupulousness.</PARA>
<PARA>In an MA thesis, G.E. Lewis says that `Mutch was prepared to sacrifice all for an important matter of principle' and that by 1930 he `had found himself in the position where the Labor Party had moved away from him'. Indeed, I think the ALP revealed its true colours and reverence for thuggery and other bastardry when, at the 1971 New South Wales conference, Paul Keating had a motion carried readmitting Lang to the ALP, which I think says it all about Paul Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The poet should have the last word. In a poem dedicated to Tom Mutch entitled `To Tom', Lawson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Life is like when we were rowing home</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">between the channel stakes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As our country concentrates its response to the Port Arthur tragedy in debating new gun laws, the question of mental health care has been mentioned but not deeply enough analysed to date as we seek answers to avoiding a repetition of the massacre of 28 April. I spoke last night in the Medicare levy amendment debate on the need to include a comprehensive review of our video violence, television coverage and mental health support programs in any serious attempt to stem the violence in our society. We not only need gun laws; we should be contemplating a total package of violence&hyphen;reducing reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will include in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a copy of a letter from a constituent of mine concerned at the apparent lessening of care for the mentally disabled, which is almost in direct proportion to the gradual deinstitutionalisation of many mental care patients:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have just witnessed a human catastrophe with the taking of innocent lives in Port Arthur. But what were the consequences prevailing in the mind of the perpetrator before he took these lives? He was allegedly diagnosed as suffering from Paranoid Schizophrenia and his life riddled with mental anxiety, much of which may have been caused by his family dilemma. His intellect was allegedly that of an eight year old, as quoted by his friend. His friend also added that maybe if this fellow had received more substantial help with his mental trauma, this devastation may have not taken place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many things which contribute to the balance of life. In this instance, not only the issue of Gun Laws should be addressed, but the immediate and direct help that is needed for those who are mentally incapable of caring for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I speak from experience. My younger sister, age 39 years, is also a sufferer of Paranoid Schizophrenia but with the added complexity of an intellectual disability. Sadly, she has been filed in the `too hard' basket in the eyes of the Mental Health Department. Dual diagnosis is very common. She had been institutionalised for a great many years. In the late 1980s, through the pros and cons of the Richmond Report and society's `Do-Gooders', my <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sister and many hundreds of mentally ill&hyphen;equipped people were `set free' from institutions to be taken to half&hyphen;way or boarding houses. These lodgings were no more than business orientated fire traps. No supervision prevailed, medical help was scant, personal security and living conditions were appalling. My sister was indecently assaulted twice whilst in these lodgings. This is not the proper care that should be offered. She was shuttled to more than fifteen of these places. She never `fitted in'. I was told there was nowhere else for her in Sydney, so my husband, another sister and myself were asked to bring her here to Orange, which we did in January 1993. After months of trying several Group Homes, the same problems arose. Those in charge of my sister's well&hyphen;being again said she did not fit into the system. They explained that the only option left was private accommodation with the help of social workers, Meals&hyphen;On&hyphen;Wheels and Home Help. Unfortunately, the help promised from the Mental Health team and Community Services was not consistent and did not last for long. More and more my sister became dependent on my help for her day to day requirements. This finally became a burden too heavy for my young family to carry. In January 1996, my sister was asked to leave her accommodation. The reason given was that she was very disruptive to the other private tenants.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People with similar complexities as my sister need permanent supervision . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I am not an advocate of permanent institutionalisation for people with mental disabilities. I realise that there is a fine path between mental health and mental instability that many tread in this increasingly stressful world. But I firmly believe that governments have largely reneged on many of their responsibilities in the mental health area by too easily embracing the deinstitutionalisation philosophy. It clearly has not worked in many cases. The letter I just read proves it. I urge the government to seriously seek national consensus on uniform video and mental health laws as they have on gun laws.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

When Mussolini invaded Abyssinia in 1935, Joseph Lyons and his Attorney-General, Robert Menzies, imposed sanctions on Italy. Do you know who opposed them? Lang Labor and then subsequently the ALP. In fact, the ALP was the only Labor organisation in the world to oppose those sanctions. For the member for Werriwa's information, things have not changed all that much. During that parliamentary debate there were seven quorums called. To quote E.M. Andrews, `The Labor Party stressed past League failures as an excuse for backing Mussolini.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1936, when Hitler occupied the Rhineland, several cabinet ministers were very bitter about the Germans. Their suspicion of Hitler was shown when Sir George Pearce, the Minister for External Affairs, rejected German arguments for the return of Australia's mandate in New Guinea. That rejection was reaffirmed by Lyons in 1938. Even after the fall of Abyssinia, Menzies gave Anthony Eden the impression that he wished to continue sanctions against Italy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than supporting Mussolini, the imposition of sanctions made an enemy of him and led to the formation of the Axis between Italy and Germany. During the Spanish Civil War the Australian government was worried about Franco's methods of warfare and supported appeals to Franco to desist from bombing towns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1937, the Australian government and the Department of External Affairs were suspicious of fascist influence in the Mediterranean, Australia's trade and defence lifeline at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that time. In 1939 Australia, along with many other countries, guaranteed support for Poland if invaded by Hitler. At that time there were cabinet ministers such as Gullett who said the Nazi regime was predatory and aggressive and Sir Charles Marr pointed to atrocities inside Germany. Just remember, in 1940, after the fall of France, Australia was the third major country in the alliance against fascism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another Commonwealth country, South Africa, there was a relatively narrow parliamentary vote in favour of South Africa joining the Allies as opposed to remaining neutral. Many subsequent leaders of that country were Nazi sympathisers and actively worked during the war to hinder the Allied effort. To suggest that Australia has a tradition like that is wrong. In Australia there were no quislings. To suggest that Menzies and Lyons would have been happy to set up a Vichy-style government is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the ALP when they were in government? In 1943, Arthur Calwell, when a minister, called for Italia Libera, an anti-fascist organisation, to go out of existence. He also appointed a leading fascist to be the unofficial Italian liaison officer in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not suggest Calwell and the ALP supported the fascists. They did not. But if banning anti-Nazi plays indicated fascist support, then the Labor controlled Collingwood Council was also guilty. If administering that infamous Gaelic test to Egon Kisch was tacit fascist support, then it is worth remembering that that movement against war and fascism was also opposed by the Melbourne Trades Hall Council and the Victorian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lyons was determined to avoid another world war. In following appeasement they were sensitive to the criticism of dictators. But look at the sort of people who were criticising the dictators. Eric Baume, who is an uncle of a current Liberal senator, was a fierce critic of the Nazis. He was such a strong critic that he was taken off 2GB.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My contention is that it is drawing a long bow to confuse appeasement with supporting fascism. Lyons and Menzies put sanctions on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2162"> Mussolini, would not give New Guinea back to Hitler and by the end of the decade were at war with the fascists. They were not supporters of the fascists.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) For the financial year 1995/96 (10 months up to April 1996) as a percentage of transmission hours the ABC has transmitted 50.6% Australian content between the hours of 6am to midnight. This is based on material transmitted from Sydney, and does not take account of any locally produced news and sport in other States and Territories. Levels of Australian content for the full year have yet to be determined.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A copy of the top rating ABC programs from 1991 to 1995 has been provided separately to the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1990 survey by ANOP on community attitudes to the ABC's role, image and position, showed that 60&hyphen;70% of the population rated the ABC as being very good or quite good for being distinctively Australian and contributing to Australia's national identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) There was significant public criticism of the ABC Board's decision to replace the state based <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>  with a national <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> . This criticism was at its most vocal between the time of the announcement on 27 September 1995 and the broadcast of the first edition of the new national program on 4 December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criticism was expressed in the national and local press, letters and telephone calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October and November 1995 the ABC received approximately 250 letters of complaint as well as petitions from Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory containing 1487 signatures complaining about the Board's decision. However, there was little criticism from NSW, Victoria or the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the national <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>  began on Monday 4 December 1995 the complaints have substantially reduced with the major area of complaint being Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The ABC continues to receive letters and telephone calls in support of the national <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> . In addition, analysis of the ratings indicates that the popularity of the program is increasing each month and that a comparison of figures for the five cities combined for the period December, January, February (the period when most complaints were received) with the corresponding period last year shows the national <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>  has a greater share of the audience than in the same months in 1995.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government intends to introduce a new Code which will require carriers to undertake stricter notification and consultation procedures to enable meaningful consultation with local government authorities about proposals to erect telecommunications facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This framework, operating in lieu of normal State and Territory planning laws, will continue until replaced by a scheme of proper planning processes, preferably from 1 July 1997, which will be developed in consultation with States, Territories and Local Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Government is mindful of the important role local government can play in assessing any proposal relating to the erection of telecommunications facilities and therefore it is intended to continue and strengthen the requirements relating to consultation with local government in relation to proposals to erect facilities within their boundaries. As noted above, the Government will also, in consultation with States, Territories and Local Government be considering what scheme should replace the current scheme in the longer term.</PARA>
